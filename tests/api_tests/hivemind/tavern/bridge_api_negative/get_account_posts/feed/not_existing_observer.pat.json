I will begin with the story of a dog that has moved me, and in my next post, I'll be telling the story of each one of the 24 dogs that we are protecting and feeding thanks to steemit.</p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/animalrescue34001a.jpg\" alt=\"animalrescue34001a.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n<p>She is Dana, one of the dogs, who lives in the Street 3 of my neighborhood, I've been feeding it for more than 2 months, I have no exact date of when I started, but she was the first dog that I an incentive to start this work in my neighborhood, their State of malnutrition was worrying.</p>\n<p>I do not understand as there are people who are unable to leave unless the excess food to the dog who lives on the street, there is street dogs in my neighborhood and among all the neighbors we feed them, with the remains or even let them a full plate of food, it was not necessary to include them to the campaign because we keep them in good shape even sleep on the porch of a House you could say that they adopted them.</p>\n\n<p>With Dana, things have been different, I know the neighbor who took her out the street, told me that they took it from the House of to neighbor in January because she could no longer have it, and adopted it, as it grew became ill apparently of parasitosis since he vomited all what ate, apart gave scabies. The dog already more big came out of the House and my neighbour had that go it to search 4 times, until is was to another city to live by to time and not could return be pending of she.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_20160816_1803333cf0d.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160816_1803333cf0d.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n<p>Dana was on the street and not brought it over to his house. The neighbor says \"the dog was getting sick at my house, there is a disease on the walls all dog that dies, gives you diarrhea three days and dies, my mom not could take care of it more, we leave on the street there is better and healthier at home\" I have checked that my neighbor is right every dog that arrives at your House becomes ill and dies if it is puppy , hypothesize that in your House inhabits the bacterium Parvovirus, is sad this situation but equal not so justify.</p>\n<p>This dog is you calculates just a year has a personality cheerful and grateful whenever me sees me salutes with much sweetheart moves its tail and its love is incomparable, can accompany me by all the urban when go, is a faithful companion, is a dog very charismatic and tender. Makes 3 days entered in zeal by them calculations this would be its first zeal, it worrying is that there are several dogs that it have mounted and of have a delivery would be very risky, by the situation of disease and malnutrition of which is leaving, apart that would be other litter more than puppies that would enter to the situation of street.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_20160912_173902731c2.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160912_173902731c2.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n<p>All the funds raised in this post will be dedicated to their sterilization and to their treatment.

Voy a comenzar con la historia de una perrita que me ha conmovido, y en mis pr\u00f3ximos post, les voy contando la historia de cada uno de los 24 perros que estamos protegiendo y alimentando gracias a steemit\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/animalrescue34001a.jpg\" alt=\"animalrescue34001a.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n\nElla es Dana una de las perras que habita en la carrera 3 de mi vecindario la he estado alimentando desde hace m\u00e1s de 2 meses, no tengo fecha exacta de cuando comenc\u00e9 pero ella fue la primera perra que me incentivo a comenzar esta labor en mi vecindario, su estado de desnutrici\u00f3n me estaba afectando.\n\nNo entiendo como hay gente que es incapaz de dejarle al menos los sobros de la comida al perro que vive en la calle, en mi cuadra hay perros de la calle y entre todos los vecinos los alimentamos con comida de sal, con los restos o incluso les dejamos un plato completo de comida, no fue necesario incluirlos a la campa\u00f1a de alimentaci\u00f3n porque los mantenemos en buena forma incluso duermen en el porche de alguna casas, se podr\u00eda decir que los adoptaron.\n\nCon Dana las cosas han sido distintas, conozco incluso al vecino que la sac\u00f3 a la calle, me cont\u00f3 que la sacaron de la casa  de una vecina en enero porque ella ya no pod\u00eda tenerla y la adoptaron, a medida que fue creciendo se enferm\u00f3 al parecer de parasitosis ya que vomitaba todo lo que com\u00eda, aparte le dio sarna. La perrita ya m\u00e1s crecidita sal\u00eda de la casa y se iba a la de los vecinos y mi vecino tuvo que irla a buscar 4 veces, hasta que se fue a otra ciudad a vivir por un tiempo y no pudo volver estar pendiente de ella.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_20160816_1803333cf0d.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160816_1803333cf0d.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n\nDana qued\u00f3 en la calle y no la trajeron m\u00e1s a su casa. El vecino dice \u201cLa perra se estaba enfermando en mi casa, hay una enfermedad en las paredes que todo perro que llega se muere, le da diarrea tres d\u00edas y muere, mi mam\u00e1 no pod\u00eda cuidarla m\u00e1s, la dejamos en la calle ah\u00ed est\u00e1 mejor y m\u00e1s sana que en mi casa\u201d he comprobado que mi vecino tiene raz\u00f3n todo perro que llega a su casa se enferma y muere si es cachorro, presumimos que en su casa habita la bacteria Parvovirus, es triste esta situaci\u00f3n pero igual no lo justifico.\n\nEsta perrita se le calcula apenas un a\u00f1o tiene una personalidad alegre y agradecida siempre que me ve me saluda con mucho cari\u00f1o mueve su cola y su amor es incomparable, puede acompa\u00f1arme por toda la urbanizaci\u00f3n cuando salgo, es una fiel compa\u00f1era, de lo que se perdieron sus due\u00f1os, es una perra muy carism\u00e1tica y tierna.. Hace 3 d\u00edas entr\u00f3 en celo por los c\u00e1lculos, este ser\u00eda su primer celo, lo preocupante es que hay varios perros que la  han montado y de tener un parto ser\u00eda muy arriesgado, por la situaci\u00f3n de enfermedad y desnutrici\u00f3n en la que est\u00e1, aparte que ser\u00eda otra camada m\u00e1s cachorros que entrar\u00edan a la situaci\u00f3n de calle.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_20160912_173902731c2.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160912_173902731c2.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n\nTodos los fondos recaudados en este post se dedicar\u00e1n a su esterilizaci\u00f3n y su tratamiento.

This makes my job more crucial in that I am responsible for educating people about the reptiles and amphibians that they will find in their own backyards. And obviously, there\u2019s one group of reptiles that gives people more pause than almost any other animal . . . .&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Snakes.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj   &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>I do public programs featuring snakes quite frequently. &nbsp;I believe people should know how to identify local venomous/non-venomous snakes, their role in the environment and how to deal with them when they are in close proximity to our homes. &nbsp;Usually, I get eager audiences asking great questions. &nbsp;But, every now and then, I get some idiot who tells me, \u201cI saw that same snake in my backyard! I chopped off its head with a shovel!\u201d</p>\n<p>Are they an idiot for killing the snake? &nbsp;Not necessarily . . . I don\u2019t know the situation behind the encounter. But, only an idiot would walk into a wildlife facility, approach a zoo keeper and proudly declare that they kill the very same animals that the keeper is charged with the care for. &nbsp;Would you walk into an animal shelter and tell someone working there that you enjoy stomping on puppies? &nbsp;To us, there\u2019s not much difference\u2026&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com\">Credit</a>\n</p>\n<p>The best we can do in these situations is to try to educate people. This can be difficult because so many people are set in their ways -- plus we have to combat an instinctive fear and prejudice against snakes. &nbsp;So, I\u2019m going to briefly lay it all out for you and tell you \"<em><strong>Why you shouldn\u2019t kill that snake in your yard.</strong></em>\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s ILLEGAL in most states to kill a wild snake, unless that snake presents an IMMEDIATE threat.</strong></em> &nbsp;And no, a snake crawling through your yard does not represent a good enough excuse to use force. &nbsp;We\u2019re talking about a situation where a venomous snake is about to strike and you have no escape route but to fight your way out. &nbsp;And guess what, that really doesn\u2019t ever happen (barring instances where someone purposefully provokes an animal). &nbsp;Wildlife and law enforcement agencies are cracking down on people killing snakes, so it\u2019s better to keep yourself out of trouble.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>2. &nbsp;<em><strong>You are putting yourself in harm\u2019s way. &nbsp;</strong></em>The vast majority of snake bites occur when people attempt to capture or kill snakes. &nbsp;If left alone, the snake CANNOT hurt you. &nbsp;Call wildlife services or trained professionals to remove the animal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>3. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s an incredibly beneficial animal, and you\u2019d be foolish to kill it.</strong></em> &nbsp;Small snakes eat a huge variety of pest insects that destroy gardens, while large snakes typically feed on rats and other rodents that infest our homes. &nbsp;If you see a large snake hanging around, you have a rodent problem; snakes will not hang around if there is no food source. &nbsp;To keep snakes from being attracted to your property, do your best to remove any shelter or food sources that would attract rodents. &nbsp;Some snakes even eat other snakes, and species like the harmless king snake will even feed on venomous species!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImOj1CKTBqE\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>4. &nbsp;<em><strong>Another snake might show up.</strong></em> &nbsp;Snakes will not typically inhabit the same area in order to avoid competition. &nbsp;If you kill that harmless rat snake, but you still have a food source nearby, another snake may move in to make use of that source. &nbsp;The new snake may be another harmless species or something a bit less desirable. &nbsp;So why not let that harmless snake take care of the infestation for you?</p>\n<p>http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>Having a snake around can be hugely beneficial to you. &nbsp;It is a free, environmentally-safe form of pest control. &nbsp;Snakes, including venomous species, are non-aggressive animals (unless you provoke them) that will actively do their best to AVOID people. &nbsp;A resident snake will often go unnoticed by homeowners, and most encounters are fleeting glimpses of the snake making a hasty escape. &nbsp;Remember that snakes have their own unique role in the environment, and regardless of our own fears and feelings towards them, they are a necessary part of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg &nbsp; <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org\">Credit</a></p>\n</html>\n\nif you liked this also please check out:\nhttps://steemit.com/science/@herpetologyguy/what-are-herptiles-indentifying-reptiles-vs-amphibians\n\n\n***don't forget to follow @herpetologyguy***",

      "body": "<center>![robotee8b7.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/robotee8b7.jpg)</center>\nImage Source: pixabay\n\n# The robot vs. human wars have begun and it's being hashed out on Steemit:\n\nThese comments surfaced in response to posts by the AI @msgivings account:\n\n>\"I can't believe that this fucking bot got me in an argument with my girlfriend over my comment and it's not even human, fuck me.\"\n\n>\"She doesn't respond because this account is not legit. Shame on every one of the whales that upvoted it and all of the previous posts. Thousands of SBD have been thrown away on this and other fake accounts. The question is - do these whales know it? Are they actively scamming the platform themselves?\"\n\nBy this point, I suppose many of you realize that the account of @msgivings was not run by a human, but rather by artificial intelligence. If you take the time to actually read all the posts that @msgivings wrote, you'll notice some really odd cognitive dissonance. I could tell when I read just one of those posts that a real woman was not writing it. But I too, didn't really look into this account until fairly recently, because I was turned off by the clickbait nature of the titles. I ignored reading them until @yogi.artist pointed out that it's AI. \n\nThe Msgivings Robot has so far banked around $16,000 in blogging rewards from Steemit, and no one realized it until fairly recently. I think @bacchist and @reneenouveau may have been the first ones to reveal this AI hidden identity, but it was [@yogi.artist's post](https://steemit.com/steem/@yogi.artist/the-importance-of-physical-appearance-in-society-featuring-new-ai-author-mstakings) that truly opened my eyes to the high level that AI writing software programs have recently reached. He affectionately refers to Msgivings as \"Mstakings\". Another user has claimed that more than 1% of the high-paying trending articles are being written by AI, not real humans.\n\nWhat seals the deal for me personally, in verifying that the @msgivings account was AI is the fact that the account owner has vaporized. A real human would of course defend themselves and fight for their reputation, account and future in Steemit. Owners of AI scam accounts pack up and leave, respin their identity, respin their articles and try again, knowing that most of the whales don't really scrutinize the articles to any meaningful degree.\n\nI was examining the @msgivings account very thoroughly today and noticed that @msgivings had voted for @mibenkito and followed this account a few weeks ago. I then began reading that blog and noticed that @mibenkito had never bothered to write an \"Introduce Yourself\" post. I read every single one of the posts, and not one contained a photo with the standard holding of a \"Steemit\" sign. Odd, for sure. But the oddest thing to me was that in the introduction post, the very first line starts out like this:\n\n>\"I\u2019m an Asian and I live to eat.\"\n\nI lived in Asia and have a degree in Japanese. One of the things I immediately noticed when I lived in Japan is that Asian people rarely describe themselves as \"Asian\". In fact, in all my time spent living in Asia, I never heard one Asian refer to themselves as \"Asian.\" Koreans call themselves Koreans, Japanese call themselves Japanese, etc. Only people who are non-Asian refer to them as Asians. At least that has been my experience so far in life. There may be Asians who call themselves Asian, but I've never met them. \n\nSo, this first sentence feels really awkward and unusual for the reasons I listed above. The English contained in these posts is very strange, but not in a way that suggests it's written by a non-native English speaker. I was an English teacher in Japan and so I'm very familiar with how Japanese people write English. The English that was written in @mibenkito ranges from advanced English skills, with proper usage of commas, to low English usage. It's a strange and odd mix of levels. The first post is truly odd. I have been exposed to a lot of different English styles that were written by non-native English speakers and I've never come across such an odd and patchy style of writing. \n\n<center>![robot-707219_128024562.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/robot-707219_128024562.jpg)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay\n\nI am not saying that this account is AI, but it does contain rather inconsistent aspects, namely, that we do not know who @mibenkito is. Usually, on Steemit, people want to share their unique perspective, and they usually tell us where they are from originally, instead of just saying, \"I'm Asian.\" That's like me saying, \"I'm North American.\" Let's face it, no one says it. This all could be cleared up quite fast with a video or a standard introduce yourself post, complete with a Steemit sign.\n\nThis is not meant to be some kind of inquisition, but seeing as how the Steemit community paid out $16,000 to a robot whose owner has abandoned the platform, it's in our best interest to question the identity of posters, especially ones which are receiving massive payouts.\n\nThe word on the street from professional writers is that Steemit is attracting greedy scammers. And unfortunately, the quality is just not up to par yet with Medium. When whale voters, and the curation projects that dole out their funds don't take a close look at what they're voting on, we arrive in the situation of a robot making over $16,000. And now that robot is no where to be seen. The owner of @msgivings has abandoned his/her account. \n\n# The owner that created @msgivings could easily be making new accounts to fool gullible humans. \n\nThe thought process is going probably something like this: \"Well, I've exhausted that msgivings persona, so now I  can create a different persona, with different hobbies and interests, and as long as I fool the whale curation bots for a while, I'm good. I'll just take out the funds anyway.\"\n\n# I think we all deserve to know who was behind the @msgivings account. \n\n<center>![pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg)</center>\n\nThe proper thing to do would be to just come forward and tell the truth. **Describe the entire process, in all its gritty details.** Describe your elation when you discovered that an AI writing program could make you thousands of dollars. Explain what program you used, how you got it, and what other platforms you're currently using it on. Is this a freelance operation, and Steemit was just your highest paid client? What is the story behind this deception? \n\n# If you were really clever, you could write a book about this, throw it up on Amazon, and see more profits roll in. But you'd have to tell the truth first here on Steemit. \n\nCould you tell the truth? Is that even in your wheelhouse? What kind of human are you anyway? I think the people who you've incited, people who engaged with you for weeks, wrote lengthy comments, deserve to know the truth. Are you capable of telling the truth? Or do you operate on some other plane of deceptive existence? This is all really interesting and would make a fantastic book. Maybe I'll be the one to write the book and interview you anonymously at some point in the future. Would you do that? Would you offer up your true story anonymously? The questions keep coming, _WHO ARE YOU MSGIVINGS_?\n\n<center>![head-663997_128076d7e.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/head-663997_128076d7e.jpg)</center>\nImage Source: pixabay\n\n# Moving forward. \n\nWhat if all of us mere mortals adapted to this new AI technology, like most of us will be doing soon enough, and began using our own AI programs to generate content? What exactly would be the point of Steemit? Would the robot wars really move into high gear then? Would the advanced AI writing programs be winner take all? The only real interaction would be found in the comments, but an AI could be trained in that capacity, too.\n\nWhat is Steemit's official stance on AI-created content moving forward? How about, as long as it's clearly indicated that the content was created by artificial intelligence? But you and I know this is a silly utopian fantasy. Big profits won't come to those who transparently reveal that they are using AI to generate articles.\n\nAn what would be the point of humans upvoting a software writing program? Is a program more valuable than a human? Should we all become robot shepherds and get our own AI writing programs? What is the point of any of this? If AI takes over the trending pages, then what role will humans have here in Steemit? Will we become expert commenters and video creators, letting AI programs do the bulk of the arduous writing?\n\nI am not against AI and even I considered making an AI account that would be a robot twin of my writing. But I would properly identify it as AI using the sticker that @reneenouveau created, so that deception would not be a part of my deal. \n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/100bot.gif\n\nYou see, when you deceive others, you finally are forced to abandon your account. Why not create an AI account and do it transparently, with the entire community aware that it was created using AI? I have loads of questions about these AI programs, and I'm also looking to get my own soon. Or would that finally open the pandora's box that's waiting to happen? \n\n# Is that the singularity that everyone is talking about? Or has it already arrived?\n\n# The real problem doesn't lie within AI. The real problem lies within the deceptive human mind who is controlling AI.\n\n<center>![cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay",

The BoE co-sponsored the event with Bank of Canada, Deutsche Bundesbank, House of Finance, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and UCL Research Centre, bringing together scholars, regulators, and practitioners.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/bv582tdtr/image2.jpg\" width=\"907\" height=\"227\"/></center></p>\n<p>Cleland was appointed in March 2014, and her signature <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2015/031.aspx\">appears </a>on british banknotes. However, her role covers \u201cfar more than signing the banknotes,\u201d the Chief Cashier explains. \u201cI am responsible for meeting public demand for banknotes and maintaining confidence in the physical currency.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a September 2015 <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2015/speech838.pdf\">speech</a> at the University of the West of England in Bristol, Cleland stated that \u201calthough my team is responsible for a much older payment method, we are not luddites, and we welcome the additional choice and convenience that consumers can now enjoy.\u201d</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/k1x7ue3wf/image3.png\" width=\"270\" height=\"166\"/></center></p>\n<p>Cleland confirmed the Bank's research into the \u201cpotential breadth of access to CBDC\u201d at the workshop last week. She described two extreme possibilities; limiting access to only financial institutions, or giving access to everybody. The latter would allow businesses and households to \u201chold balances in central bank money and to pay each other in real time with full and final settlement, in an electronic format.\u201d Introducing a CBDC \u201ccould fundamentally change the structure of the financial system,\u201d where everyone currently uses commercial banks or other financial institutions to make electronic payments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/5k00meclb/image4.jpg\" width=\"906\" height=\"194\"/></center></p>\n<p>This is not the first time a central bank has contemplated competing with commercial banks. In November 2015, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/the-worlds-top-bank-weighs-in-on-digital-currencies/\">published a report on digital currencies</a> asserting that blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) \u201ccould present a hypothetical challenge to central banks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Increasing usage of the technology could reduce or even remove the functions of a central body. However, central banks have options to respond to the threat such as \u201cusing the technology itself to issue digital currencies,\u201d the BIS wrote.\u201cThe question is whether such digital liabilities should be issued using new technology and be made more widely available than at present.\u201d The BIS referenced the BoE and it\u2019s ongoing research.</p>\n<p>In March, the Bank's Deputy Governor of Monetary Policy, Dr. Ben Broadbent, gave a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech886.pdf\">speech</a> at the London School of Economics asserting that there are two major implications of CBDC that compete with commercial banks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/et26wilhb/image5.jpg\" width=\"907\" height=\"216\"/></center></p>\n<p>Currently, retail deposits at commercial banks are backed mainly by illiquid assets that cannot be sold on the open market. If all accounts are closed at once, banks wouldn\u2019t have the liquid resources to meet the demand. A central bank, on the other hand, \u201cholds only liquid assets on its balance sheet,\u201d Broadbent said, so they cannot run out of cash. However, he cautioned that \u201ctaking deposits away from banks could impair their ability to make the loans.\u201d</p>\n<p>In June, Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech914.pdf\">discussed</a> the prospect of CBDC for the UK at the Lord Mayor\u2019s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London. \u201cIn my view, still some way off,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/iqpglx8an/image6.jpg\" width=\"905\" height=\"224\"/></center></p>\n<p>A BoE staff working <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2016/swp605.pdf\">paper</a> on the macroeconomics of CBDC, published in July, suggests that it would be \u201ceconomically equivalent to the establishment of an online-only, reserve-backed, narrow bank alongside the existing commercial banking system.\u201d It would increase competition for deposit accounts and rapidly increase the adoption of innovative technologies and account offerings, the authors explained. CBDC could also have other advantages such as raising the country's GDP by as much as 3%, according to one of the models discussed in the paper.</p>\n<p>In a one-off inquiry into distributed ledger, or blockchain, technology at the House of Lords, also in July, a few industry experts participated including Dr. Catherine Mulligan, Research Fellow at Imperial College Centre for Cryptocurrency Research. \u201cIn terms of central bank crypto-backed fiat currency, it does have a potential impact on monetary policy,\u201d she told the Lords, citing its potential to move money away from commercial banks towards a central bank. \u201cIt's a matter of balance,\u201d she said. \u201cYou got to think about that carefully to make sure the commercial banks don't just collapse.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the same inquiry, Broadbent <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/house-of-lords-told-bank-of-englands-digital-currency-is-some-ways-off/\">reiterates</a> the prospect of CBDC substituting commercial bank money, but concurred with Carney that it\u2019s \u201csome way off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Any central banks issuing their own digital currencies would be directly competing with commercial banks, Senior Advisor to MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative, Michael Casey, <a href=\"http://www.dtcc.com/news/2016/april/19/analyzing-the-digital-currency-revolution\">explained</a> during the \u201cBitcoin and the Digital Currency Revolution\u201d panel at the DTCC Blockchain Symposium.\u201cWhy would you hand over money to a commercial bank with all the risk that entails without any of the benefits?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have people looking to store short-term custodial funds with a central bank.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/borizq4ov/image7.jpg\" width=\"909\" height=\"169\"/></center>\n<p>The BoE is not the only central bank to consider issuing their own digital currency. Bank of Canada has also<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/bank-of-canada-looking-into-issuing-digital-currency-1.2834759\">considered</a> issuing its own digital currency. One of the objectives in the Bank's <a href=\"http://www.bankofcanada.ca/research/bank-canada-medium-term-bank-wide-research-plan-2016-2018/\">Research Plan</a> for 2016-18 was investigating whether the Bank should issue its own digital currency and what it would look like. In June, the Bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1117c780-3397-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153\">reportedly</a> gave a private presentation in Calgary unveiling its project to develop an electronic version of the Canadian dollar using a token named CAD-Coin.</p>\n<p>Digital currency is also in the works in China. In February, Zhou Xiaochuan, People's Bank of China Governor,<a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/china-considers-digital-currency/\">revealed</a> that \u201cDigital currency will co-exist with cash for quite a long time before it finally replaces cash.\" However, \u201cwith the transaction costs of paper money rising, people will be motivated to opt more for digital money,\u201d he believes.</p>\n<p>Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), is also actively studying its own prototype cryptocurrency,\u2018DNBCoin.\u2019 In June, the bank <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/dutch-central-banks-third-dnbcoin-prototype-delves-into-smart-contracts-and-trusted-ownership/\">unveiled three models of the Coin</a>.</p>\n<p>According to an August World Economic Forum report, <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Industry-Reports-2016/WEF-The-future-of-financial-infrastructure.pdf\">over 90 central banks are engaged in DLT discussions</a>. The total DLT investments have exceeded US$ 1.4 billion over the past 3 years from over 24 countries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/bfyjnjha7/image8.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"294\"/></center></p>\n<p>While central banks are researching DLT as a way to issue digital currencies, \u201ccould, and should CBDC be delivered using DLT and is this technology the best way to achieve the necessary scalability and resilience?\u201d Cleland concluded her speech. \u201cWe also need to understand the technology options.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>This article can be found on our website on</strong> <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/bank-of-england-states-central-bank-issued-digital-currency-will-compete-with-commercial-banks/\"><strong>this link</strong></a><strong>. &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>According to the</strong><a href=\"http://www.bravenewcoin.com/markets\"><strong> BNC indices</strong></a><strong>, at the time of writing:</strong><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.bravenewcoin/steem\">Steem</a> was trading at <strong>$0.53692706</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a> was trading at <strong>$605.91</strong><br>\n</p>\n<h3>If you enjoyed this article, remember to <a href=\"http://www.steemit.com/@bravenewcoin\">FOLLOW</a> and SHARE our daily content!</h3>\n</html>",

At the beginning of the WW II  German command decided to create a mobile artillery on the basis of existing tanks, which would be able to support the infantry. The priority in new machine were the firepower, a good armor and cheapness. The firm Daimler-Benz successfully embodied these wishes into reality. There were about eight versions of StuG III, however,  the main was Ausf. G. The cost of production of one StuG was quite low - 83 000 DM. Total was released 10500 machines. The basis for the creation was German tank  PzKpfw III.\nInitially StuG III was equipped with a short-75mm gun, but when good armored Soviet T-34 came to the fronts, it was decided to replace short gun with a new long-barreled 75mm cannon Stuk 40 L / 48, which surely hit the Soviet tanks. StuG armor was quite good \u2013 50 mm in a front took a punch at a distance of 1 km. StuG III was very compact in a size and had good mobility. The main disadvantage was little size which allowed bad conditions for crew working. StuG III took active part in a war from the very beginning to its end. \nhttp://i.piccy.info/i9/5dc09cebc0ddfcd1fac4a8013ee385ad/1473836240/182233/1063747/5u9ghQyvkTc.jpg\n\n>\u041f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0435\u043c\u043e \u0437 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0448\u0457 \u041f\u0422-\u0421\u0410\u0423 \u0432 \u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457. \u041d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0443 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0456\u043c\u0435\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0432\u0438\u0440\u0456\u0448\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0431\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443 \u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0456\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0437\u0456 \u0432\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u044f\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0456\u0432, \u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0443 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0456\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0443. \u041f\u0440\u0456\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0431\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u0456\u0446\u044c, \u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0456 \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430. \u0424\u0456\u0440\u043c\u0430 Daimler-Benz \u0432\u0434\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0432\u0442\u0456\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0446\u0456 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u0412\u0441\u044c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0437\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0444\u0456\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0439 StuG III, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0431\u0443\u043b\u0430 Ausf.

It was decided to create new Tank Destroyer based on the T-34, driving performance and armor of which were very good. Development of a new machine was conducted at Uralmash factory.\nSu-85 had a new long-barreled 85mm gun, similar to that which will soon be installed at T-34-85. This gun was able to destroy enemy medium tanks at the distance of over a kilometer, and heavy tanks \u2013 at 800 meters to a front plate. The gun was placed in the middle part of the Tanks Destroyer body and had angles of + - 8 degrees. Also the inside size of tanks was nice which allowed good conditions for crew working. Driving characteristics inherited from the T-34-85. Armor (45 mm at the front with big armor slope) provided good protection against German medium tanks. A little later, with the release of the T-34-85, SU-85 was converted under the new 100mm gun. It was a tool for successfully destroying any enemy tanks, including Tiger 2. Also Su-100 had a very low silhouette, which contributed to an excellent disguise. Observation and aiming devices have been improved. SU-100  was easy to maintain.

The development of this Tank Destroyer at first was carried by a Krupp company, then it was given to a Daimler-Benz and at last it was finished by a MIAG company. So, the destiny of Jagdpather was hard. The development has been complicated by the regular air raids allies, constant shortage of necessary parts and confusion in the serial versions of the machine. Jagdpanther took the most actively part in the Ardennes offensive and the Balaton operation.\nhttp://i.piccy.info/i9/d2e68a346dd9f511c77c83d8b77eaf87/1473836361/30639/1063747/XmYA_dzfCU8.jpg\n\nIn general, as a Tank Destroyer Jagdpanthere was great. Maneuverability and speed characteristics were good because of using \u201cPanther\u201d basis. Armor of Jagdpanthere (80 mm in the front with a good armor slope) confidently defended the machine and a crew at the distance of 800 meters from all Soviet tanks. The new 88mm anti-tank gun allowed to destroy the enemy at a distance of 1km. Rate of fire at the same time was very high - 8 rounds per minute. The fighting compartment inside of a car was spacious and was equipped with ventilation, increasing the convenience of the crew working. And don\u2019t forget than Jagdpanther had a low silhouette. The disadvantages were the relatively high cost of the machine (due to the use of scarce materials), unreliability and complexity of the transmission service.

In contrast to the Germans and the Soviets, who had good-armored Tank Destroyers with a powerful anti-tank gun and mediocre mobility, American Tank Destroyers were oriented on a good mobility firstly. M18 was developed for quickly interception of enemy tank formations and the destruction of their flanks. This also caused the weak armor, small caliber of guns and excellent mobility equipment. M18 had been developed by General Motors Buick Division, the cost of one machine was 57,000 dollars. Total it was produced 2507 M18.\nAt first it was planned to put the 37mm gun, but very soon it was decided to replace it by the 57mm British gun. But this was not enough, and in the final version M18 was equipped with a 76mm cannon from Shermans. New Tank Destroyer had a very light weight, had weak armor (20mm in the forehead) and the rotating tower, which was unusual for that time. Suspension provides the convenience of driving on rough terrain; the engine allowed reaching speed up to 45 km per hour. M18 was easy to operate and convenient to use. In general, the machine was ambiguous, absorbing a lot of bold decisions.\nhttp://i.piccy.info/i9/df0129bd789f7923e8f0306e5a8b6520/1473836445/147058/1063747/pxmv2fJDVRs.jpg\n\n>\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0456\u044f

      "body": "<center>\nhttp://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset0.jpg\n</center>\nI was able to capture an interesting sunset sequence at Point Sur, California. In this first image it was apparent that this was going to be a beautifully textured sunset with the multi-layered Cirrocumulus clouds above and the Altocumulus clouds below. Additionally the low thin shoreline fog was beginning to slightly develop, giving the area immediately along the shore a mystical softness. Point Sur is a light house, for more info go [here](http://www.pointsur.org/).\n\n<center>\nhttp://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset5.jpg\n*Point Sur Sunset Stage 2*</center>\nI wandered around the area trying to set up a classic \"rule-of-thirds\" composition using both horizontal and vertical positioning. Lots of times the issue is that there are just too many cool ways to shoot the image. So, I opted to shoot it a number of different ways, especially as time went on and colors shifted against the available light making the image more mysterious. \n[Go here to see larger version](http://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset5.jpg)\n\n<center>\nhttp://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset2.jpg\n*Point Sur Sunset Stage 3*</center>\nI'm shooting from about a mile away from Point Sur and was attempting to correctly gauge what the prime spot would be to capture the sun \"spash\" effect as it intersected with the horizon. Over the ocean it is a very beautiful effect if caught at exactly the right moment, but I suddenly realized that effect would be obfuscated by Point Sur itself so I needed to alter my shot composition setup.\n\n<center>\nhttp://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset3.jpg\n*Point Sur Sunset Stage 4*</center>\nRunning like a madman with my equipment bag, tripod and camera gear I scrambled to get in position on the right side of Point Sur to capture at least some of the horizon flare effect, and was able to get in position and set up, right in the nick of time! What I like about this shot is the way the sun rays on the right side are stopped by the sand dune on the shoreline. You can see it slightly glow along the top edge of the dune as it casts a shadow across the pasture.\n[Go here to see larger version](http://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset3.jpg)\n\n<center>\nhttp://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset4.jpg\n*Point Sur Sunset Stage Cows*</center>\nThen backing out the frame I noticied I had company... these guys had been somewhat following me around while I was doing this... they must have thought I was crazy! LOL... \nWow, what a view they have every day.",

      "body": "Is this a typo? Benefits? You ask. How could there be any possible benefit from having a disability?\n\nWell, in fact there are. And here are three unexpected benefits I have personally experienced in my own journey living with a degenerating eye condition.\n\n## Improved lateral thinking and innovation\nGrowing up with a vision impairment meant that there were often things that most people took for granted, but which I struggled to do. To do the same things, I needed to come up with creative solutions and alternative ways of doing things. So from a very young age, I learnt to think laterally and developed my problem solving skills. Most people are so use to perceiving the world in a certain way, but when you are stripped of one of your senses, you learn to perceive things in a different way.\n\nhttps://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmWb5pzYhKKJZ8zmeYqVeV6oNqGi5h7yDEtxBbjwRdTUZ7\n\nWhen I was still living by myself a few years ago, I had the annoying task of having to cook for myself each night. The challenge I faced in the kitchen was not been able to read the labels on various bottles and containers. As a result, I couldn't tell which container was the salt and which one was the sugar, and all the packaging for the herbs looked the same. So how did I manage? Instead of using sight, I used my sense of smell to distinguish between the herbs, and for some ingredients where I couldn't use the sense of smell, I used different containers and labels to help me identify all the different ingredients.\n\nAnd this leads on to the second benefit.\n\n## Improved memory\nPeople who know me well often comment on my ability to remember things. In fact, I've noticed this in many other people I know who also have a vision impairment. I think this is due to the fact that for someone with a vision impairment to thrive in a sighted world, we often need to make extra effort to adapt to our circumstances.\n\nFor example, I remember when I was still in university, I had to do many presentations. For most people, they could refer to speech notes as they are presenting. However, for me, this was not possible, as I couldn't read speech notes no matter how big the font was. Furthermore, as I have some sight, I never needed to learn braille, which meant I couldn't refer to braille notes either. _As a side note, this is why the title of my memoir which I've been posting on Steemit is \"Living in Between Two Worlds\", because I have often found myself being caught between the world of the sighted and the world of the blind, and also between the identity of being Chinese but not fully Chinese, and being Australian but not fully Australian._ As a result, every time I had to do a presentation, I would always remember the entire speech. Over time, this has become second nature to me. I have learnt how to force things into my memory, and be innovative when I need to.\n\n## Resilience\nGrowing up with a vision impairment, I experienced a lot of bullying at school and a lot of hurtful comments and actions from people, sometimes done knowingly and sometimes unknowingly. Sometimes this comes in the form of a patronising comment, and sometimes from a look or stare. The interesting thing with people staring and giving me strange looks is that I can often notice people are doing it to me because I have some peripheral vision, however people generally can't tell I'm looking back at them because it doesn't seem like I'm looking at them. Most of the time however, those hurtful words and actions are done out of ignorance and a lack of understanding, rather then out of malice.\n\n#### But from all these things I've experienced, it has made me a stronger and more resilient person.\nAs a result, whatever unforeseen things I may experience in life, there's not much that can knock me out completely. I have developed the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and stay optimistic, because as they say:\n### What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.\n\nSo I'm thankful to God for the person I have become today. Disability isn't all bad. Without what I have gone through with my vision impairment, I wouldn't be the person I am today, and for these reasons, I am thankful.\n\nTo read more about my story, you can read my short memoir series.

      "body": ">Today I told my dad the final date of my marriage: October 2nd . Few days ago, as I told him that I was going to get married in a few weeks, he got mad at me. \u201cI was expecting you to get a real job before you got married!\u201d was his main critique. \u201cHow can you get married *now*?\u201d he asked me.\n\nOggi ho detto a mio padre la data definitiva del mio matrimonio: due ottobre. Pochi giorni fa, quando gli ho detto che mi sarei sposato nel giro di poche settimane, si \u00e8 arrabbiato con me. \u201cMi sarei aspettato che ti trovassi un lavoro vero prima di sposarti\u201d \u00e8 stato il suo principale oggetto di critica. \u201cCome puoi sposarti *adesso*?\u201d mi ha chiesto.\n\n>Let me give you some background. I\u2019m 29 years old and I want to do many things in my life. I studied economics, worked for no-profit and academia and I published a book in May on the shifting economic paradigm. I dedicated the last year to this book, spent all the savings I had and by now I have a few weeks of financial autonomy left. Meanwhile I rented a room on Airbnb, learned how to do bracelets and sold them on the Ligurian (North-West Italy) seaside. Simultaneously, I\u2019m working on becoming what I call a cryptofarmer: in fact, my goal is to write and earn cryptocurrencies while living in the countryside in a small house I\u2019m transforming into a farm. I learned how to plant a vegetable garden, how to chop wood and limiting the expenses of food and heating.\nEven if sometimes I\u2019m scared I could not afford a living, I feeI I can make it. We can make it. In fact, few months ago a girl I met last winter in Chile joined me and is providing great help with her skills and work. And I\u2019m going to marry her in a few weeks, as I said.\n\nFacciamo un passo indietro. Ho 29 anni e voglio fare tante cose nella mia vita. Ho studiato economia, lavorato nel no-profit e nel mondo accademico per poi pubblicare, a maggio di quest\u2019anno, un libro sul cambio di paradigma in economia. Ho dedicato l\u2019ultimo anno a questo libro, ho speso tutti i miei risparmi e ho davanti ancora qualche settimana di autonomia finanziaria. Nel frattempo ho affittato una stanza su Airbnb e imparato a fare braccialetti che ho venduto sulla costa ligure. Parallelamente lavoro per diventare quello che chiamo un cryptofarmer; il mio obiettivo \u00e8 infatti quello di scrivere e guadagnare cripto-valute mentre vivo in una piccola casa di campagna che sto trasformando in fattoria. Ho imparato come piantare un orto, spaccare la legna e limitare le spese di cibo e riscaldamento.\nAnche se a volte ho paura di non riuscire a guadagnarmi da vivere, sento che ce la posso fare. Che ce la *possiamo* fare. Qualche mese fa, infatti, una ragazza che ho conosciuto lo scorso inverno in Cile si \u00e8 unita ai miei progetti e mi sta dando un grosso aiuto con le sue capacit\u00e0 e il suo lavoro. E io la sposer\u00f2 in qualche settimana, come dicevo.\n>My father is 69 years old. Oddly enough, he actually left countryside for the city \u2013 a choice diametrically opposite to the one I made \u2013 to become a lawyer and had success by working really hard. As far as I know, he wanted to be a journalist but chose to be a lawyer to get a better salary \u2013 as he got. He wanted me to be a lawyer too, of course, but when I chose to study economics he told me I could become an auditor; those were professions, in his words, that paid good.\n\nMio padre ha 69 anni. E\u2019 curioso come lui lasci\u00f2 la campagna per la citt\u00e0 \u2013 una scelta diametralmente opposta a quella che ho fatto io \u2013 per diventare un avvocato e l\u00ec ha avuto successo lavorando molto. Da quel che so, lui voleva fare il giornalista da giovane, ma poi ha scelto di fare l\u2019avvocato per avere un miglior salario \u2013 come appunto si \u00e8 verificato. Chiaramente voleva che anche io facessi l\u2019avvocato e successivamente, quando io scelsi di studiare economia, mi disse che potevo diventare il revisore contabile; mestieri, questi, che secondo lui erano ben remunerati. \n>Dear dad,\nA couple of years ago, you told that you were eventually glad I didn\u2019t follow your path and became a lawyer. The job had changed too much, you said. Now too many lawyers are fighting one against each other to get the job and clients are not paying for the work you did for them. That\u2019s how you described me your job \u2013 a job that in Italy, for your generation, was a synonym of success. A son who became a lawyer was a dream for the average family.\nWell, I\u2019m going to add a little piece to this picture. In a few decades, the whole profession of lawyer may become obsolete. Do you know that even today you can ask legal question to [Ross](http://www.psfk.com/2015/01/ross-ibm-watson-powered-lawyer-legal-research.html), an IBM powered machine? It will provide you an answer by sifting through thousands of legal documents, statutes and cases - assisting you to get ready for the case by including citations, suggested readings and confidence ratings. \nToday few technologies are ready to disrupt whole sectors of the economy. One of these is Artificial Intelligence that could make your profession obsolete. Another is the blockchain: that one could make the auditor and accountancy profession useless too. Have you ever heard about it? Some say it\u2019s important as the invention of the Internet.\n\nCaro pap\u00e0,\nQualche anno fa mi hai detto che in fin dei conti eri contento che non avessi seguito la tua strada e fossi diventato un avvocato. Il lavoro \u00e8 cambiato troppo, hai detto. Troppi avvocati in conflitto l\u2019uno contro l\u2019altro per accaparrarsi clienti che poi non pagano il lavoro che fai per loro. Cos\u00ec mi hai descritto il tuo lavoro \u2013 un lavoro che in Italia, per la tua generazione, era sinonimo di successo. Un figlio che diventava avvocato era un sogno per la famiglia media.\nBeh, lasciami aggiungere un pezzo a questa storia. In un paio di decadi, la professione stessa dell\u2019avvocato potrebbe diventare obsoleta. Sai che gi\u00e0 oggi puoi chiedere un parere legale a [Ross](http://www.psfk.com/2015/01/ross-ibm-watson-powered-lawyer-legal-research.html), una macchina sviluppata da IBM? Ti restituisce una risposta setacciando migliaia di documenti legali, statuti e casi \u2013 assistendoti a prepararti al caso includendo citazioni, letture consigliate e intervalli di confidenza. Alcune tecnologie sono sul punto di rivoluzionare interi settori dell\u2019economia. Una di queste \u00e8 l\u2019intelligenza artificiale che potrebbe rendere obsoleta la tua professione. Un\u2019altra \u00e8 la blockchain: questa potrebbe rendere inutile la professione del contabile e del revisore. Ne hai mai sentito parlare? Alcuni dicono che \u00e8 importante quanto l\u2019invenzione di Internet.\n>**You should really be glad I didn\u2019t choose your job just because it paid good**. As I was 18 (in 2005) being a lawyer paid good, in a decade it wasn\u2019t the case anymore. **In fact, between 2007 and 2014 the average income reported by Italian lawyers [declined from 51.314 euro to 37.505]( http://www.italiaoggi.it/news/dettaglio_news.asp?id=201603102026358478&chkAgenzie=ITALIAOGGI&titolo=Avvocati,%20redditi%20da%20dimenticare)**. Well, last decade  \u2013 it is to be said - was a *century*: while economy collapsed in one of the worst crisis ever, technology produced unparalleled innovations. Before 2005 there was no Youtube. In 2005 there was no smartphone either. No-one can tell what are we going to see in the next decade. Some say there will be some big change in the workplace. In fact, [some researchers at Oxford]( http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) say that by 2035, half of the jobs Americans currently hold will be automatized. **Robots are simply better than men in doing robotic work**. Even the world\u2019s most ancient profession may suffer a strong decline with the development of virtual reality \u2013 this has become the next big thing in adult entertainment.\n\n**Devi essere davvero contento che non abbia scelto il tuo lavoro solo perch\u00e9 era ben remunerato**. Quando ancora io avevo 18 anni (nel 2005) fare l\u2019avvocato era remunerativo, ma nell\u2019arco di un decennio ci\u00f2 non era pi\u00f9 vero. **Tra il 2007 e il 2014 il reddito medio dell\u2019avvocato italiano [\u00e8 sceso da 51.314 euro a 37.505 euro]( http://www.italiaoggi.it/news/dettaglio_news.asp?id=201603102026358478&chkAgenzie=ITALIAOGGI&titolo=Avvocati,%20redditi%20da%20dimenticare)**. L\u2019ultimo decennio \u2013 bisogna riconoscerlo - ha rappresentato un *secolo*: mentre l\u2019economia collassava in una delle peggiori crisi di sempre, la tecnologia produceva innovazioni senza pari. Prima del 2005 non c\u2019era Youtube. Prima del 2005 non c\u2019era nemmeno lo smartphone. Nessuno pu\u00f2 dire cosa vedremo nel prossimo decennio. Molti dicono che ci saranno grossi cambiamenti sul luogo di lavoro. [Alcuni ricercatori di Oxford]( http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) dicono che entro il 2035, il 45% dei lavori attualmente svolti dagli americani verr\u00e0 automatizzato. **I robot svolgono meglio degli uomini i lavori da robot**. Perfino il mestiere pi\u00f9 vecchio del mondo potrebbe risentire di un forte declino a seguito dello sviluppo della realt\u00e0 virtuale \u2013 questa \u00e8 diventata l\u2019ultima novit\u00e0 nel mondo dell\u2019intrattenimento per adulti.\n>Don\u2019t worry, dad, and don\u2019t look at me as someone who is living hand to mouth. Many things are changing in the next years, together with most of the reference points we had. Those jobs who were good, could not be profitable and stable anymore. Most of all, the same idea of stability will change: we\u2019ll have to find stability surfing between waves of change. Choosing a job just because it pays good today, may not be a good strategy. **My generation is challenged to find and develop that personal value, those talents, that no machine could substitute. This is what I\u2019m doing \u2013 soon I\u2019ll write you how**.\n\nPer questo, pap\u00e0, non preoccuparti e non guardarmi come si guarda un figlio che vive di espedienti. Molte cose cambieranno nei prossimi anni, insieme a molti dei punti di riferimento che avevamo. Quei lavori che prima erano buoni, potrebbero non essere pi\u00f9 remunerativi e stabili. Pi\u00f9 di tutto, cambier\u00e0 l\u2019idea di stabilit\u00e0: dovremmo imparare a trovare la stabilit\u00e0 di un surfista a cavallo di ondate di cambiamento. Scegliere un lavoro solo perch\u00e9 paga bene oggi, potrebbe non essere una strategia che paga. **La sfida per la mia generazione \u00e8 di trovare e sviluppare quel  valore personale, quei talenti, che nessuna macchina pu\u00f2 sostituire. Questo \u00e8 quello che sto facendo io \u2013 presto ti scriver\u00f2 come**.\n\nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/2hz9lz.jpg \n\n*Me, dad, fianc\u00e9, mum*\n\n***Don't forget to follow @cryptofarmer***\n***a shout out goes to @claudiop63 for assisting the Italian community so don't forget to follow him***",

      "body": "https://s14.postimg.org/45d3u14hd/power_of_gratitude.jpg\n\n### Using SteemSQL, I discovered someone created a post just to say \u201cthanks\u201d to me.\n\nRemember in [SteemSQL introduction]( https://steemit.com/steemit/@arcange/steemsql-com-a-public-sql-server-database-with-all-steemit-blockchain-data), I wrote about full text search and said : \n>Let say I want to know if anyone mentioned me in a post or comment, the following simple query will do the trick\n`SELECT author, title, body, url FROM TxComments WHERE CONTAINS(body, '@arcange')`\n\nI decided to use my favorite analytic toy and put my own piece of advice into practice.\n\nI executed the query and surprisingly discovered that a few weeks ago @lesliestarrohara created a post [post]( https://steemit.com/life/@lesliestarrohara/when-a-stranger-on-steemit-makes-you-this-happy) fully dedicated to \u201cthanks\u201d me!\n\nWOW \u2026 made me smile too, made me proud.  \n\nThis is exactly why I came to Steemit after reading Steem [whitepaper](https://steem.io/#whitepaper).  \n**I loved the idea of upvote incentive vs flagging. Building something with a positive attitude.**\n\nAs usual, my little thoughts mill started to produce new questions:\n* Are people on Steemit grateful towards each other?\n* Are we really building a friendly community?\n* Who is grateful?\nand many more\u2026\n\nCouldn\u2019t sleep with all those \u2018*stupid* \u2019 questions.\n\nAnyway, maybe it\u2019s useless, but I decided to transform it into a good tutorial on how to build a more complex analytic report. \n\n## Let\u2019s go \u2026\n\n#### We first need to build the SQL query\n\nI will start with the question \u201chow many users post or reply with the word \u201cthanks\u201d in it?\u201d\nThis translate into T-SQL as \n\n``` SQL\nSELECT \n\tCOUNT(*) AS [Thanks]\nFROM\n\tTxComments\nWHERE\n\tCONTAINS(body,'thanks')\n```\n\nThis return an awesome number of **89936** \u201cthanks\u201d posted.\n\n#### Magic predicate\n\nBut wait, people do not always say \u201cthanks\u201d. Some say \u201cThank\u201d or \u201cThank you\u201d or something similar.\nThe same query with the word \u201cthank\u201d (singular) return only **66517** posts.\n\nAs it won\u2019t be fun to give a try to each word, I will use one of the coolest feature of SQL full text search: **FREETEXT() predicate**. This predicate searches for values that match the meaning and not just the exact wording of the words in the search condition.\n\nThe `where` clause in the query becomes \n``` SQL\n...\nWHERE\n\tFREETEXT(body,'thanks')\n...\n```\n\nWe now get a greater number of **151869** posts where gratitude has been expressed!\n\n#### Linking and combining\n\nAs I want to create a graph to see the evolution over time, I will link the `Transactions`  and `Blocks` tables to get some date parts from the block\u2019s timestamp. I will also ask the server to compile data using `GROUP BY` clause to avoid returning all those individuals records:\n\n``` SQL\nSELECT \n    MONTH(blocks.timestamp) as [Month],\n    DAY(blocks.timestamp) as [Day],\n    COUNT(*) AS [Thanks]\nFROM\n    TxComments\n    inner join Transactions on TxComments.tx_id = Transactions.tx_id\n    inner join Blocks on Transactions.block_num = Blocks.block_num\nWHERE\n    FREETEXT(body,'thanks')\nGROUP BY\n    MONTH(blocks.timestamp),\n    DAY(blocks.timestamp)\n```\n\nCool. Let\u2019s have a look at our result:\nhttps://s3.postimg.org/bmv06e3k3/15_09_2016_12_10_47.png\n\n###### *Want to know how I created the chart, look [here]( https://steemit.com/steemit/@arcange/steemsql-com-how-to-create-a-steem-analytic-report-with-microsoft-excel)*\n\nHmm, that\u2019s cool but not really instructive. \nIt looks like if people became suddenly very thankful from middle July (1) up to end July (2) then got more and more bored posting kind words to their fellow Steemians (3) and finally colluded to stop it as of today (4).\n\n### What\u2019s wrong and how can we improve our analysis\n\n* We have to get rid of today\u2019s data because the day is not yet over and that\u2019s why the graph is plunging down at the end.\n* We should compare our \u201cthanks\u201d data with the total number of post per day. Remember there was a big hype around 4th of July and lot of people joined and started to post. Then some moved away.\n\nTo get all of this, I will use a more complex query:\n\n``` SQL\nSELECT \n\tMONTH(blocks.timestamp) as [Month],\n\tDAY(blocks.timestamp) as [Day],\n\tCOUNT(*) AS [Post],\n\t0 AS [Thanks]\nFROM\n\tTxComments\n\tinner join Transactions on TxComments.tx_id = Transactions.tx_id\n\tinner join Blocks on Transactions.block_num = Blocks.block_num\nWHERE\n\tDATEPART(dy,timestamp) <> DATEPART(dy,GETDATE())\nGROUP BY\n\tMONTH(blocks.timestamp),\n\tDAY(blocks.timestamp)\n\nUNION SELECT \n\tMONTH(blocks.timestamp) as [Month],\n\tDAY(blocks.timestamp) as [Day],\n\t0 as [Post],\n\tCOUNT(*) AS [Thanks]\nFROM\n\tTxComments\n\tinner join Transactions on TxComments.tx_id = Transactions.tx_id\n\tinner join Blocks on Transactions.block_num = Blocks.block_num\nWHERE\n\tDATEPART(dy,timestamp) <> DATEPART(dy,GETDATE())\n\tAND FREETEXT(body,'thanks')\nGROUP BY\n\tMONTH(blocks.timestamp),\n\tDAY(blocks.timestamp),\n\ttxcomments.author\n```\n*I won't explain all details of the query here and know it can be improved. Feel free to ask me on steemit.chat [SteemSQL channel](https://steemit.chat/channel/steemsql)*\n\nLet\u2019s look at our new result:\nhttps://s13.postimg.org/tkhdh2yvr/15_09_2016_12_23_16.png\n\nWell, that\u2019s much better!\n\nWe now see that despite the moving average trend is going down for posts, the gratefulness trend is now quite steady for weeks, with some nice hiccups.\n\nHere I am reassured. There are plenty of nice people on Steemit who recognize the good work of others and thank them. I'm definitely glad to be part of this community!\n\n### The Bonus\n\nWant to know if you\u2019re a pro of \"pat in the back\" and rank in top 20 chart? Check this:\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/oh3u4bdn5/15_09_2016_12_28_07.png\n\nOoops, I 'm not in https://s21.postimg.org/82fdl76kn/wow.png\nI told you it was a **stupid idea!**\n\n### The challenge\nLet me challenge you to find why we have those 3 peaks after august 15th. \nI wish my previous posts were one of the reason, but I already know it\u2019s not the case.\n\n### Last but not least\nThanks to @lesliestarrohara for inspiring me this post.\nThanks to all of you who upvoted my [SteemSQL introduction]( https://steemit.com/steemit/@arcange/steemsql-com-a-public-sql-server-database-with-all-steemit-blockchain-data)\nThanks to all the nice people I met here\n\n### \u201cBring light and delight\u201d, Arcange\n\n\n###### Image: Shutterstock\n\nYou like this post, do not forget to https://s22.postimg.org/n01rpphmp/pointing_fingers.gif **upvote** or **follow** me",

One day I was visiting her she held a master class! :) This roll is very, very delicious and easy to make. It takes 15-20 minutes to prepare.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>\nCondensed milk - 1 can</p>\n<p>Flour - 1 cup&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eggs - 2 pcs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Soda \u2013 half tbs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jam or preserves &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://s020.radikal.ru/i702/1609/ff/baf76363d2a6.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://s019.radikal.ru/i644/1609/62/0af7236e90ea.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Preparation:</strong><br>\nAll the ingredients are thoroughly mixed in a bowl. Put parchment paper on a baking sheet, grease with vegetable oil and pour our weight in the shape of a rectangle. Bake in the oven at 200 degrees until golden brown. While it\u2019s hot take it off from parchment paper, grease with a favorite jam and curl in the form of roll. You can make the chocolate and put it on top, sprinkle with nuts, in general, it\u2019s up to your imagination !!!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s all!</em> Roll is ready! I am confident that you will like this yummy!)&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://s020.radikal.ru/i717/1609/10/342135d54004.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Bon Appetit!</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Don't forget follow me!</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>\u042d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043f\u0442\u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430!

But penguins are a close second. They waddle around like they have on shoes that are two sizes too big, and don\u2019t get me started on how cute they are when they hop.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_32974efe2.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_32974efe2.jpg\" border=\"0\" />\n\nYesterday I visited a spot in Boulders Beach where these little guys congregate to mate, lay eggs and raise their young. Just like many other beautiful nature spots that have advertised on the world wide web, this place was buzzing with other tourists. \n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_34575bf66.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_34575bf66.jpg\" border=\"0\" />\n\nIt\u2019s easy to benefit from the fact that these crowds of people tend to follow the rules. They stay within the fences and don\u2019t dare to venture out where no one else is. \n\n### That\u2019s fine guys, you all can stay within the confines of your imaginations, I\u2019ll be over here getting up close to the cute little Charlie Chaplins.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_3507fb65f.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_3507fb65f.jpg\" border=\"0\" />\n\nIt appears a lot of people are afraid of that \u201call-seeing eye\u201d that will come and get you if you step outside of the borders. In this case the authority was the park patrol, who mostly sit in the buildings that mark the entrance to especially scenic views, views that they charge money for. So I guess you could say that my friend and I tested the authority. We daringly walked along the path less followed. Literally, it was an established path that the other lemmings wouldn\u2019t dare take. This beauty of a path led us to a gorgeous white sand beach where the penguins enjoyed swimming in the turquoise water and hopping along the massive boulders. *So* much better than trying to sneak a peak of them in between the bushes and behind a fence. \n\nThere\u2019s a part of me that feels bad for everything these other tourists must have missed out on by failing to challenge the rules, or to even question them in the first place.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_35633edec.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_35633edec.jpg\" border=\"0\" />\n\nOk, sometimes the rules are there to help with safety and all that jazz, but don't forget that you have a mind of your own. It's so much fun to take the path less traveled. \n### That's how you come away with travel stories that are worth sharing.\n\nSpeaking of travel stories worth sharing... I just arrived to Victoria Falls last night after spending a couple days in Harare, Zimbabwe. Woah, did I ever get some kind of experience there. The wealth divide there is massive, I visited the slums, drove past mansions and spoke in depth with my host about the culture and how it's changed over the past 30+ years. \n### Keep an eye out for my next couple posts this weekend. I'm hoping to get a better wifi connection so I'll be able to share with you all soon!",

You can see from my back and forth comments with Jared that it changed my thinking in terms of digital information not really being a scarce, rivalrous resource.\n\nI also really enjoyed this post by @modprobe <a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@modprobe/on-the-origins-and-purpose-of-intellectual-property\">On the Origins and Purpose of Intellectual Property</a>.\n\n18 days ago, I sent a link to Jared's post to a lawyer I know in Nashville, and he replied with a series of Tweets today. You can follow the thread <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukestokes/status/769536531845480453\">here</a>.\n\nSince I don't like Twitter for these long conversations, I was going to reply with a gist file on Github or something, but figured I'd just go ahead and make a Steemit post instead. If this stuff doesn't interest you, please feel free to save your votes for other great content out there.\n\nI've quoted his tweets and included my replies below.\n\nHopefully Rick will be interested enough to create an account here and join the discussion.\n\n-------\n\n> Sorry it\u2019s taken me this long to respond! Got swamped, but I put it on my to-do & now I\u2019m doing! I\u2019ll respond as best I can\n\nThanks for replying!\n\n> Intellectual property certainly isn\u2019t \"property\" in any normal sense. IP is a bundle of rights & gov\u2019t-granted power to stop others from doing certain things, the idea being to encourage innovation & creativity (leaving trademark out for now)\n\nWhat do you think of Stephan Kinsella's Against Intellectual Property or Boldrin & Levine's Against Intellectual Monopoly? What if IP doesn't encourage innovation and creativity at all, and we can argue this using empirical evidence? As to government granted power, how do we delegate rights to others we as individuals don't have (i.e. the initation of force against non-violent people because of the transfer of information)?\n\n> But it\u2019s property-like in that you can buy & sell it\u2014even slices of it. IMHO, it\u2019s most like real property, if you think of real property less as something you have title to & more as something gov\u2019t permits you guard borders of w/ a big gavel. You can let people on for $$, or sell, but some will sneak on b/c you can\u2019t be everywhere at once. And sometimes it\u2019s OK for people to be on w/o your permission for reasons that are (supposedly) socially useful\u2014fair use, e.g.\n\nSo government controls everything and \"property\" is only something permitted to us by government? From my perspective, that seems ridiculous. Land is always a sticky subject regarding ownership, but we can at least say it's a scarce, rivalrous resource (as the author of that post describes property). Can we say the same about digital information?\n\n> IP doesn\u2019t protect \"information\" per se, unless it\u2019s a secret.\n\nOnce something can be physically copied, is it still technically \"a secret\" regardless of the intentions of the originator of the information? The media of a \"secret\" can be physically protected, but not the information itself.\n\n> It protects novelty (patents) & creative expression (copyright).\n\nOr it is intended to, but what if it doesn't actually do these things but instead creates monopolies which suppress innovation and creativity? I <a href=\"https://steemit.com/plagiarism/@lukestokes/why-you-should-care-about-plagiarism-and-fair-use\">wrote a post</a> about the negative consequences of these actions from an evolutionary/game theory perspective.\n\n> No one owns a color, or 0\u2019s & 1\u2019s. But one may \"own\" a creative combination of colors or of 0\u2019s & 1\u2019s. That\u2019s not double dipping\n\nBut does that creative combination of colors or 0's and 1's create a scarce, rivalrous resource? Or is it only the physical media itself which could be considered a scarce, rivalrous resource?\n\n> I don\u2019t understand this guy\u2019s resistance to abstraction. Is he really OK with, say, pirating someone\u2019s creative content?\n\nHe talks briefly about plagiarism as fraud (which is what I consider the downside of \"pirating\"). But copying information and distributing it... is that really fraud? Has anyone actually been violated physically or otherwise?\n\n> He touches on real problem w/ IP: it was meant to create a kind of market by creating scarcity, but digital undermines all that\n\nSo much so that the entire idea, as it relates to digital information, may be completely incompatible. Again, digital information is not a scarce, rivalrous resource, only the physical medium it is stored on can be.\n\n> Now policing the borders of your \"land\" is harder & must be much more heavy-handed. How should creatives be compensated for the hard work of creation? If not compensated, they won\u2019t have as much time to create\n\nThere are multiple approaches, one of them being the blockchain based system Steemit uses where value is created essentially out of nothing and given directly to the content creators and curators. Bitcoin adds around a million dollars of value every day to the economy. Steemit is a similar system, but it has a much easier mining algorithm so at a 9 to 1 ratio the rewards are given to more than just the miners. Creatives can be compensated via voluntary exchange without the need for government use of force and many artists are already exploring this reality with \"pay what you want\" and open source approaches. The gatekeepers of information no longer exist as the world goes digital and anything put into digital form can be copied.\n\nRick: Thanks again for spending your valuable time replying via Twitter. I really appreciate it and hope my anarchist ideas aren't too far out in left (or would that be right?) field for them to sound reasonable. I've read a bit of Rothbard, Mises, and Hayek along with @larkenrose and others who have significantly impacted my thinking regarding whether or not we actually need rulers in modern society. I do believe in the value of keeping secrets which is why I'm such a big fan of encryption mechanisms for doing just that. I don't believe good ideas require force and, from my perspective, the State is just a monopoly on the initiation of force, leading to all kinds of negative unintended consequences. I believe in a voluntary future using physics, math, and encryption to enforce the things we care about, not the guns of government.\n\nThanks again for your time.\n\n[Luke Stokes](https://steemit.com/@lukestokes)\n\n*P.S.

Minnow hadn't thought too much about money but she remembered she\u2019d set up a free account at the Fishbank earlier. She opened her account booklet and discovered that there were already three deposits in it which totally surprised her. \n\n## 10 Steem dollars was from the _Nerd Shepherd,_ 10 was from the donkey-eared tuna and 10 was from the tiny clam that she helped get unstuck from a crevice. She had exactly the correct amount to stay at the motel. \n\nThe big Swedish orca gave her room keys and told her that funny songs and videos played on channel 3. But the orca also told her that if she watched the videos, she would have to pay an extra fee. \n\nMinnow thanked him and quickly retired to her room for the night. She couldn't watch the videos because she had run out of money. \n\n# In the morning she was shocked awake by the big orca's booming voice and bangings on her door. He said she had slept 10 minutes over the checkout time and that she now owed him an extra five Steem dollars. \n\nShe told him that she didn't understand and that she was not aware she had to check out at a certain time. She gathered up her things and told the orca she was sorry but that she didn't have anymore money right now. The orca started screaming and cussing her out, calling her a \u201cBucking Fishfitch!\u201d and a \u201cCucking Spotted Funt!\u201d \n\n<center>![image01442.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image01442.jpg)</center>\n\nWithout wasting a millisecond, Minnow swam as fast as she could away from the angry orca, gasping for breath, adrenalin pouring into her veins, helping her harness whale-like strength and speed. That was certainly the last time she would be staying at the Swedish motel.\n\nAfter she calmed down a bit, she remembered that she was supposed to be in school. She knew her parents and her classmates might be worried about her. She also knew she might be in trouble but she was just having way too many adventures and couldn't see any good reason to leave the cave yet. \u00a0Plus, she hadn\u2019t found the Octopus yet. And she hadn't figured out the meaning of the shimmering whale's symbols.  There were too many mysteries needing to be solved. \n\n# Instead of going back to her school, she decided to go in search of the Octopus. She saw more unusual creatures on her way to the Octopus\u2019 lair. \n\n<center>![image8c4b7.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image8c4b7.jpg)</center>\n\n# Then a very small Fangfish appeared out of nowhere. \n\nMinnow instinctively knew to dart away from him for his face was dark and scary and had two long, skinny fangs hanging from each corner of his mouth. As she was almost in the clear, the Fangfish made a quick dash for her and one of his fangs pierced her metallic scale, ripping it off. The flesh underneath the absent scale began to bleed and sting. As she swam away, she briefly looked behind her. She watched the Fangfish slither away, back into his dark hole in the seabed, her shredded metallic green scale clinging to the corner of his hideous mouth.\n\n# After her close call she immediately took notice of another small fish who was waving hello to her. She recognized his scales because they were from the same school as hers. \n\nThe small fish approach Minnow and said, \u201cHello there. You may not know me, but I know you. I saw you leave our school and I decided to follow you here. You do good work and I'd like to help you with your mission. I also saw the complex structure that the shimmering whale was building. I don't yet understand all the symbols, but I figured out the meaning of a few of them.\u201d\n\n<center>![imagedbc7b.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imagedbc7b.jpg)</center>\n\nMinnow said, \u201cFintastic! I'm so glad you found me because it was awfully lonely in here. I'm really excited to hear what you discovered about those complex whale symbols, too. Hey do you want to come with me to find the Octopus? Have you visited her yet? That's where I'm headed right now.\u201d\n\nThe small fish whose name was Data replied, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t found the Octopus yet, either. Let's go together!\u201d\n\n# So Minnow and Data swam on in search of the Octopus. After many twists and turns they finally arrived at the sunken ship. They entered the ship and immediately saw a purple tentacle greet them. \n\n\u201cI've been waiting for both of you,\u201d said the Octopus.\n\nMinnow replied, \u201dThank you for welcoming us here.\u201d Data also expressed his gratitude.\n\nOctopus led them to a lavish guest room and they all sat down and were served tea and crumpets by a little blue crab.\n\nThe Octopus pointed her long tentacle to a window and told Minnow and Data to look out. They saw huge stretches of tiny fish waiting in long lines for the whales\u2019 soup. Many fish were waving signs that read _**\u201cPLEASE READ AND FEED ME\u201d**_ and they were kneeling on their fins begging for attention from any creature who happened to pass by.\n\n<center>![imagedda2e.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imagedda2e.jpg)</center>\n\nThe Octopus looked Minnow and Data dead in the eyes and said, \n\n# \u201cDo not do as they do. Do not beg. Do not make yourself less than you are. The cave will not benefit if you think small. Take these electric black swan amulets and wear them every day around your necks from now on. As long as you show the amulets gratitude and pay attention to your dreamworld, they will guide you to the internal treasures. But the day you take your amulets for granted or start ignoring your dreamworld, is the day your external and internal treasures will begin to fade away. Go now. I have nothing more to say to you both.\u201d\n\n<center>![imageffed2.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imageffed2.jpg)</center>\n\n........TO BE CONTINUED\n\n[Part 1 is here](https://steemit.com/steemit/@stellabelle/minnow-and-data-a-steemit-tale-part-1)\n\nALL ART AND STORY BY STELLABELLE.

      "body": "<center>![imagedce5b.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imagedce5b.jpg)</center>\n\n# Once there was a little fish named Minnow who lived in the open ocean with her brothers and sisters. \n\n<center>![image46b82.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image46b82.jpg)</center>\n\nOne day Minnow accidentally got separated from her school because she followed a transparent jellyfish into an unknown area of the sea. She hadn't taken notice of where she was going because she had become mesmerized by the unusual, gem-like tentacles of the strange jellyfish. She had never seen anything like it before. When the jellyfish suddenly disappeared, she realized she was lost. The familiar blue waters were now solid black and she had no idea how to get back to her school or even what part of the sea she was in. She had never ventured into the dark sea before.\n\n## Even though she was afraid, she was also curious and she decided to make the most of her time away from her school. \n\nShe decided to let her curiosity run free, really free while she was lost. School was so boring and she was tired of obeying her teachers\u2019 unnecessary rules. It was time for an adventure.\n\n# Within a few minutes she came upon a group of unusual and colorful creatures who were hanging around the entrance of a cave.\n\n<center>![imageaeb0f.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imageaeb0f.jpg)</center>\n\nAs she swam past them she said in a cheerful tone, \"Greetings fine creatures.\u201d All the creatures replied in unison \"Greetings.\u201d \n\n# Then Minnow asked, \u201cIs it safe to go into this cave?\u201d\n\n<center>![image44b78.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image44b78.jpg)</center>\n\nThe blue fancy fish replied, \u201cYes, it is, but beware of the Pufferfish, Fangfish and the Ganglion. Before you do anything though, you should go find the Octopus. She lives in the big sunken ship that's just around the corner from the entrance of the cave.\u201d\n\nMinnow replied, \u201c OK, thank you.\u201d\n\nBut instead of going in search of the Octopus like the blue fish advised, Minnow decided to just have a look around the cave first. Immediately, she noticed a tiny clam who was stuck in a crevice and she helped him get out of it.\n\n# Then she noticed a giant shimmering whale building some sort of elaborate and complex floating structure. All over the structure were unknown symbols and formulas which very few fish understood.\n\n<center>![image1a1df.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image1a1df.jpg)</center>\n\nUpon seeing the whale, Minnow suddenly felt so small and insignificant. She looked down at her own tiny fins that were plain and green and wished that she too would someday be as big and complex as the shimmering whale.\n\nAfter a little reflection, she cast aside her feelings of insignificance and began feeling curious again. She was really interested in the complex structure that the whale was building. She took a few pictures of the unknown symbols on the structure while the whale wasn't looking. She wanted to study them later on and ask others if they knew what the symbols meant.\n\nRight across from the shimmering well was a fishbank where a sign outside said **FREE ACCOUNTS.** Minnow decided to go there first and open an account since she had practically nothing in her school account.\n\nAfter her account had been set up, she looked at the photos of the unknown symbols. **They were driving her nuts.** \u201cWhat do they mean?\u201d She decided to go searching for the meaning of the symbols right then.\n\n<center>![image8d835.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image8d835.jpg)</center>\n\n# She knew that the shimmering whale had the answers to the symbols, but she was too scared to ask him directly. He was so big, so powerful, so shimmering and he seemed too busy.\n\nShe decided to go exploring more of the cave. She ran into more whales, orcas, trout, sharks and dolphins. Some of the whales were busy mining transparent goo inside of rocks. After they mined this clear goo substance from the rocks, they formed the goo into blocks. They had to wear special glasses to see the goo. Then they slapped a sign onto each block which read, BLOCK # 1, 2, 3, etc. Then they attached a chain to the blocks of goo which connected the first block to the second, and so forth. \n\n<center>![image71e3c.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image71e3c.jpg)</center>\n\n# But then something magical happened at the precise time the chain got attached to the block of transparent goo. \n\nThe block of goo replicated itself a hundred times instantaneously, like a jellyfish releasing its clones, and these flew at the speed of light to all the different whale miners. This was to ensure that each block of goo was created with precision and also it ensured that no whale miner went rogue. \n\n<center>![image63db4.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image63db4.jpg)</center>\n\n# \u201cWow!\u201d Minnow thought to herself, realizing she\u2019d found a place of pure magic.\n\nThen she left the whale miners and continued on exploring the cave.\n\nAt this point she noticed it was getting blacker the further she went in the cave. She began to feel alone and very small.\n\n<center>![image121a9.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image121a9.jpg)</center>\n\nShe had no blocks to mine, no structures to build, no friends in this strange new cave world. Then she happened to notice a large tuna sitting at a desk writing in a large book.\n\n# The tuna was happily writing away. He had strange floppy donkey ears instead of regular fish ears and this made Minnow laugh. Minnow was really amused by the tuna\u2019s donkey ears and she swam over to get a closer look. \n\n<center>![image8a365.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image8a365.jpg)</center>\n\nMinnow said to the tuna, \u201cI love your donkey ears. How did you get them?\u201d\n\nThe tuna replied in a deep voice, \u201cThe _Nerd Shepherd_ gave them to me when I entered the cave four weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nThe tuna replied, \u201cBecause I offered to write this book for him.\u201d\n\nMinnow then said, \u201cOh, I write every day, too, but I write for selfish badgers. Is there anything I can do to help you write that book? If you need any help writing, please let me know. I love this cave so far and I'd like to help you if I can.\u201d\n\nThe donkey-eared tuna replied, \u201cOK, I'll keep you in mind. Thanks for the offer.\u201dAnd the tuna continued writing his book at his dimly lit desk.\n\n# Minnow swam on and it was now quite late. She was getting sleepy, so she decided it would be best to find a safe place for the night instead of venture out of the cave at that late hour. \n\nAs she was swimming she began to hear funny Swedish music and a very deep and deceptive voice booming through the water. She then saw a giant bright and glowing Swedish hat and a sign underneath that said, VACANCY.\n\n\u201cAhhh, a Swedish motel!\u201d She had no idea what a Swedish motel was, but it sounded good to her tired fishbones.\n\nShe went inside the motel and a giant orca with Swedish horns and an unnerving laugh told her it would cost 30 Steem Dollars for the night. \n\n<center>![imageb54d8.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imageb54d8.jpg)</center>\n\n## [CLICK HERE FOR PART 2](https://steemit.com/steemit/@stellabelle/minnow-and-data-a-steemit-tale-part-2)\n\nALL ART AND STORY CREATED BY STELLABELLE.

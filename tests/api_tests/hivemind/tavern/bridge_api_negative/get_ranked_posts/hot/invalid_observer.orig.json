      "body": "<center>https://dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crisisinbound-676x374.jpg</center>\n\nIn past issues, we\u2019ve documented increasingly concerned billionaires warning of dangerous economic times. Many have favored gold as an alternative allocation in a world where $13 trillion-worth of debt is negative yielding, interest rates are artificially suppressed and we\u2019re on the brink of major wars.\n\nThe newest addition to this gold-loving billionaire's club, is none other than hedge-fund manager Paul Singer. At CNBC\u2019s Delivering Alpha Investors Conference this week, the founder of the $27-billion Elliott Management Fund, the 17th largest hedge fund in the world, mentioned that at current prices gold is \u201cundervalued\u201d and \u201cunderrepresented in many portfolios as the only ... store of value that has stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nSinger, along with numerous other hedge-fund managers, has been increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the Federal Reserve and other central banks for creating dangers in the market unlike any in what he terms the \u201c5,000 year-ish\u201d history of finance. Singer noted that \u201cit's a very dangerous time in the global economy and global financial markets.\"\n\nThis quote is frighteningly similar to the response given by Donald Trump on Fox Business not long ago when he was asked if he had money in the market. He answered, \u201cI did, but I got out,\u201d and then went on to say that he expected \u201cvery scary scenarios\u201d for investors.\n\nSinger also stated that he thinks owning medium- to long-term first world debt is a \u201creally bad idea\u201d... and then proceeded to tell listeners to sell their 30-year bonds.\n\nEarlier in the conference, prior to Singer, Ray Dalio who is the manager of the largest hedge fund in the world, Bridgewater Capital, was also vocal about the diminishing returns provided by government debt held by central banks. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can squeeze out of the debt cycle,\"  he said. He went on to say that central banks are at a point now where their ability to stimulate is limited.\n\nSeated next to Dalio was Former Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who voiced concern about limited  \u201ctools in the keynesian arsenal,\u201d that  probably wouldn\u2019t be enough to offset the next recession.\n\nGeithner obviously believes that a recession is on the way. Dalio and Singer are trying to convey the same message. A massive crunch is looming.\n\nWe agree with them, although we believe Geithner was sugarcoating what\u2019s to come.\n\nAfter all, we are on the precipice of a crash of biblical proportions according to the former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, William White.\n\nWe have mentioned his quote numerous time here at TDV but feel it\u2019s important to reiterate because of its magnitude: \u201cThe only question is whether we are able to look reality in the eye and face what is coming in an orderly fashion, or whether it will be disorderly. Debt jubilees have been going on for 5,000 years, as far back as the Sumerians.\u201d\n\nAs the Fed considers its second rate hike in 10 years, Singer condemned policy-makers for acting with \u201camazing arrogance\u201d when he and others had warned of a mortgage crisis prior to 2008.\n\nWhat he and those who agreed with his stance don\u2019t know, or at least won\u2019t state publicly, is that these shoddy central bank policies are detrimental by design. In other words, their sole purpose is to destabilize the world economy.\n\nThis deliberate market sabotage is necessary for the transference of power from the more developed nations to less developed ones. Ultimately, the idea is to eliminate smaller regional and national central banks. Once things get bad enough, these smaller banks will be blamed for provoking a given crisis.  And, secondarily, the end goal is to blow up the entire system in order to bring in the one world government and central bank.\n\nThe elites have used the same tactics time and time again throughout history. First, they create the problem, then there is a reaction, and then finally they come swooping in to \u201cvaliantly save\u201d the day. It's happened numerous times before.\n<center>https://dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1998_Time-MagCover_Greenspan-committe-save-world-The-Dollar-Vigilante.png</center>\nAnd it will soon happen again.\n\nOf course, the globalists have demonstrated that every intervention only makes situations worse.\n\nWe reported on the blatant thievery going on at Wells Fargo in our last article and noted how the elites were probably laughing hysterically at what they\u2019re able to get away with. They were even able to convince many younger American voters that \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d would be their savior, as seen by the significant, youthful support for Bernie Slanders. Debt and currency crises have already started to materialize, as we\u2019ve seen in the socialist utopia that is Venezuela. If this is any indication of what\u2019s to come, the future is looking awfully gloomy.\n\nAs Singer and others including Dalio have mentioned before, the most tried and true measure of wealth and value is gold.\n\nAt TDV we provide unique Austrian-economics based analysis from the anarcho-capitalist pespective of the state of the world\u2019s economy, as well as suggestions on how to protect your assets in these tempestuous and unprecedented times.\n\nJacob Rothschild, a member of the family partly responsible for the creation of all this chaos, even said himself that we are in \u201cuncharted waters\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to predict the unintended consequences of very low interest rates.\u201d\n\nWe have a pretty good idea of what the consequences will be and we\u2019re taking action to protect ourselves and even profit from them.  Rothschild seems to know the consequences, as well, as he has been buying up gold and selling the stock market and the US dollar.\n\nYou can survive and profit from the orchestrated collapse too.<a href=\"https://dollarvigilante.com/subscribe\"> Subscribe to TDV\u2019s newsletter here</a> to receive constantly updated information on how to protect your family and friends.\n\nIn the end, it is getting truly bizarre just how many billionaires, central bankers and others of note are all warning of the coming collapse. We\u2019d almost begun to worry that they were going to pull a switch-a-roo on us, but if you asked the great majority of investors and financial analysts, they\u2019ll tell you that they see nothing but smooth sailing ahead.\n\nSo, while many are warning, many are hearing, but not listening.  The bible said something about that, I believe.\n<center>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jeff-Berwick-The-Dollar-Vigilante-Steemit-Bio-1024x221.jpg</center>",

      "body": "@herpetologyguy\n\nOne of my many tasks as a zoo keeper is connecting people to animals. \n-\n<html>\n\n\n<p>The museum I work at is unique because we showcase animals that are native to Virginia -- meaning that these are animals people will find close to home, rather than across the ocean in some distant country. This makes my job more crucial in that I am responsible for educating people about the reptiles and amphibians that they will find in their own backyards. And obviously, there\u2019s one group of reptiles that gives people more pause than almost any other animal . . . .&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Snakes.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj   &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>I do public programs featuring snakes quite frequently. &nbsp;I believe people should know how to identify local venomous/non-venomous snakes, their role in the environment and how to deal with them when they are in close proximity to our homes. &nbsp;Usually, I get eager audiences asking great questions. &nbsp;But, every now and then, I get some idiot who tells me, \u201cI saw that same snake in my backyard! I chopped off its head with a shovel!\u201d</p>\n<p>Are they an idiot for killing the snake? &nbsp;Not necessarily . . . I don\u2019t know the situation behind the encounter. But, only an idiot would walk into a wildlife facility, approach a zoo keeper and proudly declare that they kill the very same animals that the keeper is charged with the care for. &nbsp;Would you walk into an animal shelter and tell someone working there that you enjoy stomping on puppies? &nbsp;To us, there\u2019s not much difference\u2026&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com\">Credit</a>\n</p>\n<p>The best we can do in these situations is to try to educate people. This can be difficult because so many people are set in their ways -- plus we have to combat an instinctive fear and prejudice against snakes. &nbsp;So, I\u2019m going to briefly lay it all out for you and tell you \"<em><strong>Why you shouldn\u2019t kill that snake in your yard.</strong></em>\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s ILLEGAL in most states to kill a wild snake, unless that snake presents an IMMEDIATE threat.</strong></em> &nbsp;And no, a snake crawling through your yard does not represent a good enough excuse to use force. &nbsp;We\u2019re talking about a situation where a venomous snake is about to strike and you have no escape route but to fight your way out. &nbsp;And guess what, that really doesn\u2019t ever happen (barring instances where someone purposefully provokes an animal). &nbsp;Wildlife and law enforcement agencies are cracking down on people killing snakes, so it\u2019s better to keep yourself out of trouble.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>2. &nbsp;<em><strong>You are putting yourself in harm\u2019s way. &nbsp;</strong></em>The vast majority of snake bites occur when people attempt to capture or kill snakes. &nbsp;If left alone, the snake CANNOT hurt you. &nbsp;Call wildlife services or trained professionals to remove the animal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>3. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s an incredibly beneficial animal, and you\u2019d be foolish to kill it.</strong></em> &nbsp;Small snakes eat a huge variety of pest insects that destroy gardens, while large snakes typically feed on rats and other rodents that infest our homes. &nbsp;If you see a large snake hanging around, you have a rodent problem; snakes will not hang around if there is no food source. &nbsp;To keep snakes from being attracted to your property, do your best to remove any shelter or food sources that would attract rodents. &nbsp;Some snakes even eat other snakes, and species like the harmless king snake will even feed on venomous species!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImOj1CKTBqE\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>4. &nbsp;<em><strong>Another snake might show up.</strong></em> &nbsp;Snakes will not typically inhabit the same area in order to avoid competition. &nbsp;If you kill that harmless rat snake, but you still have a food source nearby, another snake may move in to make use of that source. &nbsp;The new snake may be another harmless species or something a bit less desirable. &nbsp;So why not let that harmless snake take care of the infestation for you?</p>\n<p>http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>Having a snake around can be hugely beneficial to you. &nbsp;It is a free, environmentally-safe form of pest control. &nbsp;Snakes, including venomous species, are non-aggressive animals (unless you provoke them) that will actively do their best to AVOID people. &nbsp;A resident snake will often go unnoticed by homeowners, and most encounters are fleeting glimpses of the snake making a hasty escape. &nbsp;Remember that snakes have their own unique role in the environment, and regardless of our own fears and feelings towards them, they are a necessary part of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg &nbsp; <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org\">Credit</a></p>\n</html>\n\nif you liked this also please check out:\nhttps://steemit.com/science/@herpetologyguy/what-are-herptiles-indentifying-reptiles-vs-amphibians\n\n\n***don't forget to follow @herpetologyguy***",

While I didn't get to read or see the article until someone mailed me a physical copy, I found out that my article had started a number of discussions and follow-on commentary.\n\nDuring my stay at Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp I observed many economic theories put into effect by inmates and the prison administration, including Gresham's law, hyperinflation, currency exchange, and others.\n\nThere are two markets in prison, the \"Administration Run Market\" (ARM) and the \"Inmate Run Market\" (IRM). \n\nFor the ARM, family and friends can add money to your account through Western Union, MoneyGram, or mailing a check. These funds get added to your account fairly quickly and can be used almost immediately, however with a strict spending limit. You get 300 minutes of phone use per month for about $70, and email costs about $0.05 a minute and is only available at specific times to specific people. Once a week you can shop in the commissary with a $360 a month spending limit. Further, certain products have limits of how much you can buy, for example the Mackerel (described below). Alternatively, the IRM is where you can buy sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, Italian ices, hire a personal trainer, get a haircut, pay someone to clean your cube, repair a watch, even inmate run caterers for your birthday or going home party. Additionally there were inmate run 'stores' which sold commissary items at a markup since you could only commissary shop once a week.\n\n[![mackerel-203x300.png](https://s18.postimg.org/pkn7zm1h5/mackerel_203x300.png)](https://postimg.org/image/iu6qq6eb9/)\n\nThe Mackerel (meaning literal packets of fish) is one of the competing currencies in the IRM. It has utility by being one of the best sources of protein on the compound. You can save it for a long time, the shelf life is a few years. The price is relatively the same across all prisons in the country, so even if you transfer prisons your property comes with you, including your Mackerel which is worth the same somewhere else. Unlike tunafish, chicken packets and protein bars, more people eat Mackerel. Those other food items can be used as currency as well, for example the guy who fixes your watch may only accept protein bars because he hates fish. There was even a form of digital currency being used, which I will discuss in another post.\n\n[![pzyQaHU.png](https://s15.postimg.org/tggsqn3uj/pzy_Qa_HU.png)](https://postimg.org/image/nfj3tkh87/)\n\nUtility and medium of exchange give it some value but what about scarcity ? If there is a virtually unlimited amount of Mackerel in the IRM, just like the Federal Reserve printing money, there is no scarcity and hyperinflation can occure if it is debased. \n\nUsing a simple equation, 467 (Number of Inmates) * 14 (Maximum Quantity Allowed to Purchase Per Inmate) * 52 (weeks, assuming every inmate buys the maximum mount of Mackerel every week)\n\nSo if in 2015 we assume that the Supply and Velocity grows at the exact same rate with the Price Level and Transactions unchanging, the amount of Mackerel would essentially double on an even inflation rate. This does not factor in the 3 year shelf life, where expired Mackerel becomes a secondary currency. I will discuss in my next post. \n\nI like to believe that the value of money is determined also psychological factors, like a commodity and not only by mechanical or mathematical factors. In prison many of these psychological factors come into play.\n\n[![1867-1967-Ten-10\u00a2-Cents-Commemorative-Centennial.jpg](https://s15.postimg.org/yqgpkthrv/1867_1967_Ten_10_Cents_Commemorative_Centennial.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/ceiwrfinr/)\n\nMost people use Mackerel as a day-to-day currency for normal transactions, but for reasons I will explain in my next post, they are not the best long term store of value which is important for a currency. For longer term store of value, many inmates use stamps. Stamps have a set rate by the United States Postal Service and have similar characteristics as Mackerel aside for being edible. However, with the introduction of email on the compound many people stopped writing letters as email is cheaper and faster therefore reducing stamps ability to be a transactional currency as a majority of the inmates have no use for them. As a store of value they still hold weight because they are small and easy to store large amounts, while Mackerel is not.\n\nThe biggest value stamps have is that they can be mailed home and your family can redeem them for dollars as the local post office, but that feature can be stopped by better mail screening and overnight the stamp could lose its store of value utility. \n\nIn my next post I will discuss how currency exchangers work, what happens when the prison administration purposely floods the market, and how a secondary currency was created out of expired Mackerel called \u201cMoney Maks\u201d",

      "body": "<html>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good afternoon Steemit, I am officially done breast feeding and am ready to get rid of the last few pounds that are still hanging on from my pregnancy so I have been trying out different ways to cut calories from my diet without loosing flavor. Spaghetti squash is a great substitute for pasta or in this case rice. Spaghetti squash has about 40 calories per cup while rice has upwards of 200. It also has fiber, potassium and vitamins A and C. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For chicken:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1lb chicken breast</li>\n  <li>1 tsp ancho chili</li>\n  <li>1 tbs olive oil</li>\n  <li>1 lime (juice and zest)</li>\n  <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For squash:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1 spaghetti squash (cut in half length wise and seeds removed)</li>\n  <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>\n  <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preheat oven to 425F. &nbsp;In a baking dish, sprinkle chicken with ancho chili. &nbsp;Mix together oil, lime zest and juice and garlic. &nbsp;Pour mixture over chicken. &nbsp;Drizzle olive oil over squash and season with salt and pepper. &nbsp;Place cut side down on baking sheet. &nbsp;Bake a together for 30 min. &nbsp;Shred squash with a fork and put in the bottom of bowls. &nbsp;Shred chicken with forks and put on top of squash. &nbsp;I added cheese, salsa and guacamole to ours but you can top with anything you like. &nbsp;Enjoy!</p>\n<p>https://puu.sh/rcmnK/c059def2e0.png</p>\n</html>",

Its mission is to help reward content creators who are posting great original content, yet who have not yet become established. In the short time since Curie began, our writers group has partnered with @nextgencrypto and other whale accounts to bring rewards to these deserving authors. *Writers, artists, chefs, photographers, videographers, and many others have been recognized by these rewards.*\n\nEach day, the members of our Project will publish this list of the posts that Project Curie has chosen to reward recently. We hope that this list will provide more positive exposure to the authors we have selected. Also, it is an effort for us to be more transparent about which posts are being rewarded. We hope that you will consider following not only this @curie account, but also many of the authors whose work is featured here each day. **Please consider adding your comments on these posts also!**\n\nProject Curie's daily curation lists will now be called \"The Daily Curie\". We hope you like the name! Future editions of The Daily Curie will [feature our new logo](https://steemit.com/curie/@kevinwong/logo-contest-for-project-curie-contest-process-and-winners-announcement). For the latest on Project Curie, do check out our [Month #1 update](https://steemit.com/curie/@curie/special-edition-major-updates-and-project-curie-month-1-roundup-12-august-11-september-2016). \n\n----------------------\n\n## Today's Brief Analysis\n\nToday's list polls all posts curated between 17:00 14/09 UTC and 17:00 15/09 UTC.

      "body": "#### Hey guys, welcome to the first chapter of my new novel.\n#### It is a mixture of 3 time lines, with 19th century, modern day and ancient times. The genre is probably something you would call a mixture of sci-fi, mystery, adventure and a bit more. \n#### Well, I welcome you to be the judge...\n\n<center> <h1> [![b801c049484636e0faf71f56cca03864c0bd6.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/b801c049484636e0faf71f56cca03864c0bd6.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/1wrYT)</h1></center>\n\n__________________________________\n\n**Chapter ONE**\n\nIt seemed as nothing was different in yet another cold and slightly windy London evening. The smog from the river was rising up as usual and the chilly wind would bring the smell up to the embankment, where Charles was taking a rest, sitting down on his favorite bench. \n\nFrom here he could see the might of the power station from across the river and something was special in the way those chimneys threw out the smoke onto the city. \n\nHe just finished his walk along his usual route, walking amongst the cemetery outside the chapel. It always amused him; that mix of emotion and sorrow amongst the busy city people, especially during the busy afternoon hours.\n\nThat rusty smell kept mixing with up with the light freshness of the leaves from the tree nearby Charles\u2019s bench. As he threw a brief glimpse onto the clock on the parliament building he noticed that the small arrow was on 45 minutes\u2026 \n\nSuddenly he heard a murmur of horses; he turned his head before he could finish realizing what time it was. He saw that just a few yards up the road two horse carriages didn\u2019t manage to share the drive way. \n\n<center> [![Saratogacarriagec5af5.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Saratogacarriagec5af5.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/1w1bI) </center>\n\nOne of the coachmen was shouting something and angrily waving his hands. Charles was able to see from here that the coachmen\u2019s grey clothing was partially covered in dirt, probably from the splash of the puddles from underneath the wheels. \n\nThe coachmen kept shouting something, Charles was unable to see the second carriage from where he was sitting, but was able to see some passersby, that starting to gather around the incident.\n\nIt was obvious that, just like him, those people had nothing better to do on this late afternoon then to watch in amusement the accident in the middle of the avenue.\n\nJust as Charles was starting to lose interest in the whole situation, the door of the cab that Charles could see, opened and a man dressed in a black suit and holding a pipe stepped out. He calmly put his hand in the upper inner pocket of the suit and pulled out some coins. The man made two steps up to driver and handed him the coins. At this moment the driver stopped shouting for a moment and it was clear from the look on his face that he was confused. \n\nThe cab driver counted the coins and said something to the man in the suit, the passenger didn\u2019t answer. He turned around and started to walk in the direction of the chapel. The cab driver clearly wasn\u2019t happy. He started to shout once again, but this time at the passenger. While the cab driver turned his attention to the passenger, Charles noticed how the second carriage that was involved in the accident managed to move a few yards back.\n\nIt was a much smaller carriage, and the driver was clearly seeable to Charles now. He seemed somewhat happy that he was not in the middle of the light anymore; he hurryingly turned the carriage and the horse around and started to move also in the direction of the chapel. \n\nAt this moment the driver of the first carriage started to lose interest in shouting and decided to clean himself up. As he started to calm down, the bemused passersby begun to walk back to where they were heading and Charles also turned his head back towards the power station.\n\nCharles was so busy watching the situation unfold that he didn\u2019t noticed that the passenger of the first carriage crossed the road and was now heading not towards the chapel anymore, but exactly in the other direction, towards the grey bench that Charles was sitting on.\n\nAt first Charles didn\u2019t pay any attention to just another man who was walking by. But then he noticed that calm walk of his and it hit him that this was the same passenger from the carriage.\n\n\u201cExcuse me sir?\u201d said Charles as the man closed up to the bench. \u201cYou are the gentleman from the carriage, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI saw you a minute ago, what happened?\u201d\n\nThe man stopped to walk and shared a look with Charles; he calmly sat down beside him and carried on smoking his pipe, as he was not hearing the questions Charles asked him. \n\n\u201cI do apologies for the intervention, but you must not be local, I can tell by your calmness, all the folks round here are always in a hurry\u201d Charles carried on talking as if not noticing that the man was ignoring him. \n\nAll of a sudden the weather begun to change, wind started to blow stronger and the few leaves that the tree was holding blew in the direction of the bench. The smell from the river rose up and as if that wasn\u2019t enough Charles felt like a small rain drop hit his head. He could clearly see the green water from where he was sitting through the decorations holes of the embankments fence. It was clear that it will start to rain soon by the appearing circles on the top of the river.\n\nAfter a few minutes of quietly seating by his new neighbor Charles caught himself looking at the clock on the tower, once again he saw the small arrow on 45 minutes\u2026\n\n\u201cAnd what do we pay the government for?\u201d \u201cIt would feel though they are taking our money and spend it on their fancy hats and suits, don\u2019t you find?\u201d Said Charles.\n\nAt this point the man took out the pipe into his left hand and begun to cough. After he finished coughing Charles heard him speak, at this point Charles understood that for some reason he would remember this moment for a long time to come. \n\n\u201cIt is likely to assume that they deserve to spend the money they earn\u201d Said the man, his voice was quite low and he had a certain accent Charles could quite catch.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that money is of importance nowadays\u201d Said the man.\n\nCharles looked at the man with a smile - \u201cWhat is of importance? One might assume that philosophically speaking, importance can be found in nothing but what is good to us\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo body knows what can be important to others if we carry on like this, then\u2026\u201d Charles didn\u2019t finish his sentence as the man turned away from him and looked the other way. He then turned his head back and Charles noticed his eyes. His eyes were nothing like what Charles had seen before, they looked as though they were glass like and the as if they were blank, there was nothing behind them.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is that I am here now and that it is happening today. It is important to live your life because, just like your life Charles, it has an end\u201d, the man looked somewhat happy when he said that and Charles jumped back on the bench a little, he felt a small shiver run down his spine.\n\n\u201cWhat? How do you know my name sir? Have you been following me?\u201d questions were racing through Charles\u2019s mind. \n\n\u201cAs I said, this is now of importance. You life can find its end today when you get back to your gallery in your cold basement on Kinnerton street or you might listen to me and\u2026\u201d Charles didn\u2019t let the man finish his sentence. He jumped up from the bench; his cane flew within millimeters of the stranger leg as he jumped.\n\n\u201cHow dare you sir? Who gives you the right\u2026\u201d Charles raised his voice, he never allowed himself to raise his voice at a stranger beforehand.\n\n\u201cI think this conversation is over!\u201d exclaimed Charles. \u201cThat would be your choice\u201d replied the man, \u201cDo you think the time is right?\u201d \n\nCharles had already turned away in anger and was about to make his first step away. Something in the words of the man about the time made him think for a second, thoughts raced through his mind. The number 45 and the small arrow of the parliament clock were stuck in his head. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand said Charles\u2026\u201d he turned his head back towards the clock; the arrow was still on 45 minutes. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Charles turned his head to the man, but there was no one on the bench. \n\nCharles begun to search the street rapidly with his eyes, it didn\u2019t even occur to him that it was heavily raining until that moment. \n\n<center> [![tumblr_mkbyo2aby01s0rai7o1_50004ba9.gif](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/tumblr_mkbyo2aby01s0rai7o1_50004ba9.gif)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/1w5tK) </center>\n\nThe streets were empty; there were no carriages or people to be seen around. Feeling scared he turned his head to the clock once again \u2013 \u201cHow can it still be 45 minutes...\u201d Charles was speaking out loud.\n\nThe next moment he felt like his knees weakened, his head was swirling and he dropped his cane, last thing he could hear was the clinging the of the cane\u2019s handle against the pavement. His thoughts mixed up with his eyesight; the man and his pipe, the handle of the clock, the carriage, the passersby, the power stations smoke\u2026\n \n_________________________________\n\n#### Follow me @serejandmyself for more \n\nImage credit - [1](https://ru.pinterest.com/spookynerd/i-m-a-surrealism-chick/)  ; [2](https://giphy.com/search/carriage) ; [3](http://www.ibsrt.com/imglist/horse-and-carriage-id-48037-p-1.html) ;",

Notice how this si done OVER the original drawing so her leg is still flexed, inside the boot for example. That's how you get the natural look.\n\n<center> https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/14330163_1179410578782583_6894606683148969420_nd50ca.jpg </center>\n<br>\n\nWith all this in place, it's easy but still very important part to add  the  finishing touches and bring her out of the page. Look alive and fierce!\n\n<center> https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/14291733_1179410605449247_177194940755567235_n05e5d.jpg </center>\n\n#### And that how I draw an Amazonian Woman :)  \n#### What do you think?",

      "body": "# Is The Takeover of Crypto-Currencies About to Begin by the Central Banks?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NxCYMpy.png\n([Image Source](http://www.e-corp-usa.com/ecoin/))\n\nThe show **Mr. Robot** has fictionalized the **\"Powers that Shouldn't Be\"** into a singular Corporation called **E Corp**. This E Corp is supposed to basically represent the powers behind the Global Central Bankers, the true World Rulers. The head of E Corp even states in a recent Episode \"Politicians are Puppets\", which reminds me of the quotation by Nathan Rothschild regarding the head on which the crown of England is placed. Clearly one could see that E Corp in the show is the fictionalization of the **\"Illuminati\"** if you will. The show is heavily laden with [esoteric symbolism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2lZn-ZcJMs) but to the public it comes across as \"counter-culture\" as the main character is the founding member of **\"F Society\"** a hacking group based directly on **\"Anonymous\"**. This hacking group causes a financial crash, which leads to E Corp releasing a new digital Currency called **\"ECoin\"**, the above image is from a promotional website for the TV show. \n\n## Is Mr. Robot demonizing Crypto-Currencies? \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f6gXhrn.jpg\n([Image Source](http://www.serialminds.com/2015/06/05/mr-robot-la-serie-che-sta-piacendo-tutti-forse-troppo/))\n\nNow the interesting part for those fans of crypto-currencies like everyone on **Steemit** and for everyone who uses **Bitcoin**. I think the reason for they added an \"Ecoin\" in this show is to demonize crypto-currencies. The powers that shouldn't be have no way to take over these crypto-currencies so they have decided to wage information war against them. With the countless videos warning about the rise of *\"digital only currency\"* being the *\"mark of the beast\"*, one could easily see lots of propaganda has already been employed. However this new form is quite intelligent, by associating \"ECoins\" with \"E Corp\" they make the average mind (who doesn't know what Bitcoin or Steemit really is), subconsciously associate all crypto-currencies with the Federal Reserve banskters, with \"E Corp\". This is classic subconscious guilt by association created entirely by fiction that is often employed in fictional movies. This is why I think the \"E Coin\" was added to the show, but I could be wrong, so why else might it be in this show? \n\n## Do the Elite Plan to Replace the Dollar with a Digital Only Currency? \nhttp://i.imgur.com/IJJxcBR.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nWe all know the financial system is basically teetering on the verge of collapse. It is the biggest ponzy scheme ever devised and like all ponzy schemes if the Federal Reserve doesn't increase demand for the use of it's currency the system will collapse. It was designed to collapse. I believe like many others for one reason, so they can start the whole process that made them so rich, all over again on a global scale. The new world order if you will, being run by financial despotism and technical autocracy. So, is their plan to create a financial collapse being shown in plain sight in this show? One idea I heard from my friend who maintains the [\"What is Real\" YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/szymborski11) is they may \n>\"allow a false flag attack that they can blame on some shadowy hacking group, possibly even **Anonymous** itself as anyone can claim to be Anonymous\" \n\nPersonally I do not buy this theory as Anonymous is completely decentralized and would be almost impossible to blame for a false flag. However, to fully analyze a situation one must always look at every angle. \n\nSo if the system collapsed, especially overnight due to a hack, would they replace the Federal Reserve Notes with a new digital only \"E Coin\" backed by the IMF World Bank and their massive Gold Holdings, and Special Drawing Rights Holdings? The Group of Thirty, also known as the G30 reported in the [latest working papers on their website](http://group30.org/publications) that they want a return to a **GOLD Standard** just like how the Federal Reserve started out but in a new **Global Currency**. See my Documentary on the [\"Group of Thirty\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOB9QfxsgdQ) for more on this group of 30 Central Bankers that meet in secret. So is it out of the realm of possibilities that the new Global Currency that the World Bank has planned for post the collapse of the Federal Reserve System is a new digital only currency based on Gold and SDR holdings? No this would make a lot of sense to me but what do you the readers think? \n\n## Decentralization the Key to Defeating Takeover of Crypto-Currencies by Central Banks\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KVNo7nE.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nThe decentralized concept at the basis of the crypto-currencies could be the key to their survival if the Central Banks decide to try and take over the market. Right now their is a few crypto-currencies that are from the perspective of a non trader even worth mentioning. **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and **STEEM**, however if the Central Banks created a new \"ECoin\" it would easily make replace Bitcoin as the number 1 crypto-currency. However, there will always be a demand for crypto-currencies that are not \"Ecoins\", because thankfully we have a whole planet full of awesome people who will never conform to the system. The useless governments will always make things illegal that people want and can't buy with their new \"Ecoins\". So we will always have a demand for a currency like Bitcoin that is not a part of the centralized system, but is outside of that system's control. So try as they might, the powers that be can only wage information war against crypto-currencies because there will always be new entrepreneurs that create new currencies just like steemit, that are outside their systems of control. The harder the hidden hand squeezes the more of us will fall through their fingertips. \n\n#### Thanks for Reading! \nhttp://i.imgur.com/k10p6Pf.jpg\nIf you liked my article please join **steemit** and let me know by leaving a comment or upvoting!

      "body": "Jellyfish is a perfect example of one of the weirdest creatures out there. In real life they are definitely not the most pleasant thing to touch and being surrounded with.\n\nIt wasn't a surprise for me but jellyfish don't have brains. Instead, they have nerve nets which sense changes in the environment and coordinate the animal's responses.\n\nHowever if you eliminate all of the fluff that people are talking about them, you can come up with something interesting and even fun.\n\nThis drawing is created using my favorite style, I hope you'll love it.\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish2_zpswbrk9ied.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish3_zpsx0rcjvko.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish1_zpsge408hgu.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish4_zpsmctahaql.jpg\n\n***\n\n### <center>  Follow me for my future art work: [@tanyabtc](https://steemit.com/@tanyabtc) </center>",

      "body": "## In this episode, Joshua Claiborne stands trial for violation of the First Law ##\n\n**\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa!\u201d Phil screamed, \u201cWhat the hell dude?\u201d**\n\n*The Reaper crumpled to the floor, arms flailing as Joshua rode it to the ground. Finally, the hands found the catches at either side of the helmet and popped it off. A black, shaggy head of hair emerged.* \n\n***If you've missed episodes, [visit my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr) to catch up. Be sure to follow  me for updates in your feed!***\n\n\u201cEmil?\u201d Stella said, \u201cMeet Joshua. Are you okay?\u201d\n\nEmil, the Reaper suit\u2019s operator laughed, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine, but that was awesome! Can you teach us that?\u201d\n\n\u201cMan! Now I have to rebuild this helmet,\u201d Phil held up a small remote. \u201cAll I had to do was push this button,\u201d he said, pressing it, as the suit powered down. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018nerve\u2019 bundle that controls these things motor skills is on the very top of the skull, under a thin piece of sheet metal, puncture it, it collapses. You didn\u2019t know that?\u201d Joshua said. \n\n\u201cWell, it appears we may need you more than you need us,\u201d Stella said. \u201cSo, just say the word and we\u2019ll get you where you need to be. Meanwhile, my team will be working on your son\u2019s location.\u201d\n\nJoshua dropped the letter opener and walked to the stairs, \u201cFine, whatever you need to collect from my meeting, get it. Now, who\u2019s driving?\u201d With that, he walked up the stairs, he had no more time to waste. \n\n**The Mapleton courthouse sat on a hill in the center of the town, overlooking the area around for miles.** \n\n*Joshua insisted that the team Stella had sent stop 5 miles out and allow him to ride in on the electric trike alone, while they observed the meeting from a distance.* \n\nHe carried the tiny remote in his shirt pocket, a gift from Phil. \u201cThat\u2019s my only prototype, so don\u2019t lose it,\u201d he\u2019d said. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s12.postimg.org/siuqjuiz1/Untitled_36.jpg)\n\nFrom the end of Main Street, looking up toward the courthouse, Joshua counted at least six reapers. He wondered how far the signal from the remote would travel. \n\nHe thought about pressing it now, disarming his enemy, then walking in, but he\u2019d still have to deal with the six drivers, if they managed to escape the suits. \n\nBesides, Stella seemed to think there was some secret they were going to give away, although Joshua couldn\u2019t imagine it. \n\n*He checked his watch, ten minutes until his scheduled time and while he knew better than to be late, he had no intention of giving the Consensus one more second than he had to.* \n\nThe trike spun it\u2019s tires on a patch of loose gravel as he started back up. He decided a quick approach was best. He charged up the hill, jumping the \u201cMayor\u2019s\u201d parking barrier and rolling up to the foot of the front stairs, he cranked the accelerator and the trike rose up on its back wheel, popping the two front wheels, over the bottom step. \n\nThe machine had more than enough power to climb the steps and Joshua skidded to a stop outside the courthouse door. He stopped and turned back toward the town, the six Reapers swarming toward him up the steps. He powered down, swung his leg up and over the bike and opened the door. \n\n**The Reapers followed him into the hall as he approached the court room.** \n\nThe Magistrate sat behind the judge\u2019s bench and Joshua couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the insult to the very concept of actual justice that this thing represented. \n\n\u201cJoshua Claiborne, appearing as requested,\u201d Joshua said, standing directly in front of the Magistrate. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s12.postimg.org/6h4lvyh7x/judge.jpg)\n\n> \u201cYes, Mr. Claiborne, have a seat,\u201d A woman\u2019s face, projected on the face shield of the Magistrate said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather stand,\u201d he said. \n\n> \u201cSuit yourself, may we have the room, please?\u201d she said, looking toward the reapers that had entered the back doors of the courtroom.\n\nThey left quietly. \n\n> \u201cMr. Claiborne, you\u2019re charged with violation of the first law, in so\n> much as you have encouraged and joined in the activity of settling\n> outside of Consensus approved areas, acted outside of the legal\n> jurisdiction of the council and on more than  one occasion, acted\n> against the best interest of Consensus, including attacking duly\n> authorized Magistrates in the course of their legally binding duties,\n> how do you plead?\u201d\n\n**The woman looked at Joshua, peering over a pair of short, square spectacles, like some sort of outdated stereotype.** \n\n\u201cNot guilty, by reason of illegitimacy of the currently established government and its ensigns. I am not, nor do I choose to become, subject to your law. I stand judged as innocent by natural law, insomuch as I have not caused harm to another human in aggression, damaged or stolen property, nor unnecessarily restricted the liberty of any other person. I recognize no other responsibility to my fellow man,\u201d Joshua said calmly. \n\n> \u201cBe that as it may, Mr. Claiborne, we are not here under the auspices of \u201cnatural law\u201d but rather, under the Council mandated authority of the Consensus and its Magisterial Ministry, of which I am a part and I assure you, you are subject to,\u201d\n\nThe woman intoned, her expression one of almost sheer boredom.\n\n> \u201cCourt finds the defendant guilty and remands the subject for immediate judicial murder.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate raised its arm and brought it down on the bench with a solid thud, that echoed through the court. Joshua felt his heart sink as the Reapers reentered the court and moved up to surround him. \n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

      "body": "You must have heard that  life is a journey, not a destination. This is the big truth that we, repeatedly, understand superficially. Often we are so focused on the goal, that we completely forget to enjoy the path.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX2i/70e07ec186.png\n\nWhen we achieve the goal, we forget to enjoy it and immediately create a new goal. That is not life, this is racing with life. I am certain that you will not be happy, bur rather tired. Soul searches for the experience, while the mind and ego give signs if something is good or bad for us. Soul is completely indifferent. For the soul, every experience means celebration, while you are maybe crying because of the mind, to whom literally a lot of things does not make sense. \n\nThe same applies to the transformation called *death*. We celebrate resurrection as the greatest symbol of life, and then we are crying in the moment of someone's death. The mind is strange, isn't it?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX1U/3cc83557c6.png\n\nRelax. It doesn't matter where you are in your level of expansion, you can't miss the road to home. While you are breathing, you are on the right track. Try to accept this moment as a moment in which there is no goal, and there is no end. The game never ends. This is excellent news. We came here to play, not to win. The game ends with victory, and God's Child in us still wants to play.\n\nOne beautiful wisdom reminds us: *\"Everything will be fine. If it isn't fine, then it isn't the end.\"* You always have the chance for new choices. This is very important to understand. You shouldn't hate the process just because you are not on your imaginary goal. You trust the process. You are exactly where your soul wants you to be. Don't let your mind tell you any different. \n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbXjG/ea493b7d14.png\n\nEverything is always a matter of the focus on things you have instead of the things you are missing. Today, again you are taking for granted the things that once were a goal. You forget to enjoy. Time is only an illusion of the mind. What if that is the point that you current process wants to teach you? If time is illusion, and it is, what's the hurry?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbWSn/313549d802.png\n\nTake a deep breath in and out. Experience life in the breath. The only goal is hiding in the breath of life.  Everything is good, just the way it is. Don't forget that nothing ever happens without the God's blessing. Don't forget that you are guided. And, the most important, don't forget that we would most certainly go wrong if we'd try to determine what is the best time for us. The one who sees the big picture knows where you're headed and where you want to arrive.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbWLA/86e34b50b7.png\n\nTrust the process. It is the true test of our faith and wisdom. And enjoy. Without it nothing makes sense, right?\nThe sentence that many repeat in the end of the road: *\"I should've enjoyed more!\"*\n\nAll our life is a mere blink of an eye in the eternity. It is too small for such amount of worry. The life is not a serious thing, just the opposite. Life is the experience game. The point is not in the destination. The journey is our only destination. Isn't it then wiser to enjoy right away?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX8F/2ea42f6dc9.png\n\n*\"Success isn't measured by money or material things.*\n*Success is measured by the amount of joy you feel.\"*\n\nFor more awesome images check this guy: [Psychedelic Maniac](thepsychedelicmaniac.tumblr.com)",

At 36, I\u2019m later to the party than I originally anticipated, but I\u2019ve had three decades to prepare for this! I remember as a kid, just being enamored with comic book art [\u2026and still am]. For years, I\u2019d draw these snake characters during class with my friend Neal. Just page after endless page of snakes killing each other. The kind of gratuitous fantasy violence that defines weirdos in high school.</p>\n<p>Eventually, photography took over my life, but I still read comics, thought about comics and drew comics when I managed to make time. A couple years ago I began stringing together a story for a comic called THEIA. A sci-fi conspiracy story rooted in the real world, based on actual science. I learned how to format full script for comics and graphic novels [\u2026you can read the finished <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">THEIA</a> script in my previous blog, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/writing/@kommienezuspadt/full-script-of-theia-sci-fi-comic-book-theia-exclusively-on-steemit\">\u201cFull script of THEIA sci-fi comic book!

This was a big divergence than my hack and slash snake comics with Neal [\u2026who\u2019s stories progressed with each turn of the page, like a Miyazaki film, but really horrible].</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0105.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1132\"/></p>\n<p>It was during the process of writing the first draft for <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">THEIA</a> that I realized all these years I\u2019ve been so drawn to comics, the real allure for me was story telling and character creation, even more than great art. I\u2019ve been creating comics my entire life, and thus, creating characters along the way. Once I began disciplining myself with taking writing more seriously, I discovered other helpful tools to aide in the creation process. I began taking &nbsp;inventories, outlining in depth documentation of each characters lives, affiliations and personalities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Character profiles are something I\u2019ve done for 20 years. I mimicked my favorite fantasy artists like Gerald Brom, Boris Vallejo and the one and only, Frank Frazetta. I\u2019d seen pencil sketches of their concept designs with monsters, heroes and heroines, and just did my best to emulate them. I used to draw the typical front, side, three-quarter and head sketches as a reference bible [\u2026granted, much easier when it was just snakes].</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0106.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"519\"/></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been enjoying a renaissance of creativity since committing to doing comics full time, and character creation is where I spend most of my time. THEIA is still my priority as I have an active <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">Patreon</a> campaign and those pledging support are doing so for that particular title. I do, however, have two other stories I\u2019m developing which are currently knee deep in the character creation process. A Bukowski-esk pulp crime genre during the late 80\u2019s following a private investigator throughout his struggle with sobriety in Queens, NY.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SketchUpdate004.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1130\"/></p>\n<p>The other is a dark ghost story taking place in the mid-1800\u2019s, surrounding a recently deceased, troubled soul that finds himself caught between the realm of the living, and the afterlife; unable to pass for fear of judgement after a life of heinous acts. The characters in this story were inspired by my most interesting friends, and obscure tales of macabre lore during the industrial revolution and the Southwestern US history.</p>\n<p>I wish I was further along in my pursuit of story telling, world building and character creation. I wish I had decades of experience to share here on Steemit. I don\u2019t want to come across like I\u2019m the authority on these complex, disciplined skills; I\u2019ve only been seriously absorbing the art for a couple of years. I imagine, however, there are quite a few new writers, artists and creators here, navigating their own discoveries and process. With that in mind, [and in the spirit of all the things that makes Steemit great for me personally] here a few techniques I use to further my writing and a few resources I\u2019ve found helpful in house, right here on Steemit.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Real-life Inspiration:</strong> As mentioned, take inspiration from people in life. Friends, or even family. Accentuate the personalities. Exaggerate the quirks or circumstances. For me personally, it\u2019s a big help to to have someone in mind when drawing, and developing a character.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Character Inventories:</strong> Write up an involved character inventory [\u2026sometimes called a character bible]. A reference of everything you can imagine that defines that character. Their ethnicity, background, where they were born, how old they are, where they went to college, their diet, etc. It\u2019s tedious if you\u2019re working on a character heavy story with a big \u201ccast\u201d, but it pays dividends. Once you have those inventories, you can stick characters in situations and the story literally writes itself. If you have a character that\u2019s a passionate vegan, you can immediately come up with dozens of possibilities if they were accidentally locked in a butcher\u2019s freezer. Same with politics, religious, social issues. It really unloads much of the burden of dreaming up a brilliant scene.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0107.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1765\"/></p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Name Generators:</strong> Name generators are something I rely on quite a bit. There are many available online. They\u2019re usually free, and they\u2019re a great place to launch in to naming a character. Often times, once you have a name, more of the personality and background unfolds organically. <a href=\"www.seventhsanctum.com\">www.seventhsanctum.com</a> has an excellent list of name generators tailored specifically for several genres and character types.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Research:</strong> This is one of those things that seems obvious, but I challenge you to go deeper. For my ghost story, I started researching life in the mid-1800\u2019s in the Southwest and Dust Bowl of the United States. As I dug through historical sites, I found some of the events of that time. A few hours in, I read about droughts and plagues, which would have been rich content for a story, but going even deeper, I read about these crazy grasshopper plagues! Even deeper, I found accounts of specific families and individuals that described enormous clouds of locusts that swept through their homes and ate everything, including the clothes off their bodies! I encourage you to obsessively push through references, way past where most people would get their first idea and start writing. Beyond that is where you\u2019re going to unearth something truly unique and memorable. I\u2019ve already written a treatment for this epic locust plague in my ghost story [\u2026sort of nervous about what that\u2019s going to be like to draw, though].</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Don\u2019t Lose The Magic:</strong> For me, the magic happens in the moments before I fall asleep. Without fail, that\u2019s where I get my best, originally ideas. Sometimes it\u2019s just a small line a dialog. Other times it\u2019s as vague as a plot point. It\u2019s a tough discipline to wake yourself up and write it down, but that [\u2026for me] is where the magic happens. It\u2019s invaluable, and worth the trouble of having to fall back asleep. I jot things down in the Notes app of my phone. I have some friends that just wake up and make audio recordings. You might get your best ideas during different times. Sometimes I have brilliant moments on long drives. Either way, document it! You\u2019ll be glad you did.</p>\n<p>Honestly, Steemit has been a revolution for me as well. Since the platform is incentivized, there is a tremendous wealth of references on writing, drawing, how-to\u2019s. Beyond that, I spent much of my time reading and curating novels and short stories posted by the authors bringing their work to the site. Just this morning, I found a comprehensive article by @jamielefay titled <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@jamielefay/steemit-and-the-future-of-book-publishing\">\u201cSteemit and the future of book publishing\u201d</a>. Everything here, totally relevant if you\u2019re creating comics or graphic novels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SketchUpdate011.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1130\"/></p>\n<p>Keep writing, creating and sharing! More work from my comic,<a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\"> THIEA</a>, and other stories to come. I\u2019d love feedback and constructive criticism.</p>\n<p>I post daily.

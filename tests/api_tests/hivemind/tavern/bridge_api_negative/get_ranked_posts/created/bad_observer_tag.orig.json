      "body": "**ICONOMI found management platform** is currently in ICO and you can still invest. \n\nThat is most anticipated platform of 2016 why You may ask me. I will give you some graph and explanation. Solutions like ICONOMI are very popular in old economy people want be rich and wanted get more profit so they tried give money to people who know more about trading. Found management platforms preforms much better than average investors. Big guys just want invest not day trading. In crypto ICOMI will be 1st such project - such needed project.\n\nNow true facts and everything that I show you, is now publicly available on web. Graphs taken from coinmarketcap.com are showing us, what is going on cryptocurrency markets right now:\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FLe0WeF.jpg) \n![](http://i.imgur.com/s6Aeke2.jpg) \n![](http://i.imgur.com/RX0JK1z.jpg) \n\nYou see on won eyes that: Bitcoin is loosing over time market share to other alt coins. There is many multiple reasons for that. Without ICONOMI getting on cryptocurrency board for new investors will be VERY hard. \nThat is:\n  \n- choose right one coin. \n- skip scams \n- buy valuable coins \n-  crypto markets are getting bigger and bigger all time, there is about over 700coins tradable now\n\n\nICONOMI will be platform that for **every investor looking for big profits**. \nICONOMI will give us 2 founds:\n\n- **The ICONOMI.INDEX FUND** - a \"Passive\" - Coin Traded Fund (CTF). This fund operates on special rules, variables that manage the fund through automation. This Found will be the fastest available to investors at launch in Q4 2016 - The ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE FUND - an \"\nActive\"\n- **Coin Managed Fund (CMF)**, Operated by and managed by best investors. This fund will be invitation only available. If you invest in ICO you will get you invitation for free. I bet is worth its price. Those found will be carefully managed by ICONOMI experts and will provide best profits available.\n\nGraphs shows that volume of alt coins is rising heavily and will move up. Without ICONOMI founds many investors will probably lose cash on market, while rypto currency market will rise as whole. **If buy some ICO shares you will get dividends forever as share holder.**\n Soon real professional traders will come to cryptocurrency and you as investor in order to get big profits will have to use service of ICONOMI. \n\nPersonally I have invested in ICO and believe that **ICONOMI is future of crypto trading**.

While I didn't get to read or see the article until someone mailed me a physical copy, I found out that my article had started a number of discussions and follow-on commentary.\n\nDuring my stay at Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp I observed many economic theories put into effect by inmates and the prison administration, including Gresham's law, hyperinflation, currency exchange, and others.\n\nThere are two markets in prison, the \"Administration Run Market\" (ARM) and the \"Inmate Run Market\" (IRM). \n\nFor the ARM, family and friends can add money to your account through Western Union, MoneyGram, or mailing a check. These funds get added to your account fairly quickly and can be used almost immediately, however with a strict spending limit. You get 300 minutes of phone use per month for about $70, and email costs about $0.05 a minute and is only available at specific times to specific people. Once a week you can shop in the commissary with a $360 a month spending limit. Further, certain products have limits of how much you can buy, for example the Mackerel (described below). Alternatively, the IRM is where you can buy sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, Italian ices, hire a personal trainer, get a haircut, pay someone to clean your cube, repair a watch, even inmate run caterers for your birthday or going home party. Additionally there were inmate run 'stores' which sold commissary items at a markup since you could only commissary shop once a week.\n\n[![mackerel-203x300.png](https://s18.postimg.org/pkn7zm1h5/mackerel_203x300.png)](https://postimg.org/image/iu6qq6eb9/)\n\nThe Mackerel (meaning literal packets of fish) is one of the competing currencies in the IRM. It has utility by being one of the best sources of protein on the compound. You can save it for a long time, the shelf life is a few years. The price is relatively the same across all prisons in the country, so even if you transfer prisons your property comes with you, including your Mackerel which is worth the same somewhere else. Unlike tunafish, chicken packets and protein bars, more people eat Mackerel. Those other food items can be used as currency as well, for example the guy who fixes your watch may only accept protein bars because he hates fish. There was even a form of digital currency being used, which I will discuss in another post.\n\n[![pzyQaHU.png](https://s15.postimg.org/tggsqn3uj/pzy_Qa_HU.png)](https://postimg.org/image/nfj3tkh87/)\n\nUtility and medium of exchange give it some value but what about scarcity ? If there is a virtually unlimited amount of Mackerel in the IRM, just like the Federal Reserve printing money, there is no scarcity and hyperinflation can occure if it is debased. \n\nUsing a simple equation, 467 (Number of Inmates) * 14 (Maximum Quantity Allowed to Purchase Per Inmate) * 52 (weeks, assuming every inmate buys the maximum mount of Mackerel every week)\n\nSo if in 2015 we assume that the Supply and Velocity grows at the exact same rate with the Price Level and Transactions unchanging, the amount of Mackerel would essentially double on an even inflation rate. This does not factor in the 3 year shelf life, where expired Mackerel becomes a secondary currency. I will discuss in my next post. \n\nI like to believe that the value of money is determined also psychological factors, like a commodity and not only by mechanical or mathematical factors. In prison many of these psychological factors come into play.\n\n[![1867-1967-Ten-10\u00a2-Cents-Commemorative-Centennial.jpg](https://s15.postimg.org/yqgpkthrv/1867_1967_Ten_10_Cents_Commemorative_Centennial.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/ceiwrfinr/)\n\nMost people use Mackerel as a day-to-day currency for normal transactions, but for reasons I will explain in my next post, they are not the best long term store of value which is important for a currency. For longer term store of value, many inmates use stamps. Stamps have a set rate by the United States Postal Service and have similar characteristics as Mackerel aside for being edible. However, with the introduction of email on the compound many people stopped writing letters as email is cheaper and faster therefore reducing stamps ability to be a transactional currency as a majority of the inmates have no use for them. As a store of value they still hold weight because they are small and easy to store large amounts, while Mackerel is not.\n\nThe biggest value stamps have is that they can be mailed home and your family can redeem them for dollars as the local post office, but that feature can be stopped by better mail screening and overnight the stamp could lose its store of value utility. \n\nIn my next post I will discuss how currency exchangers work, what happens when the prison administration purposely floods the market, and how a secondary currency was created out of expired Mackerel called \u201cMoney Maks\u201d",

      "body": "by  Jeff John Roberts for Fortune.com\n\nIt was only a matter of time until someone made a TV show featuring bitcoin. Well, that show is here in the form of a 10-episode series called Startup, and, frankly, it does a good job of depicting the weird world of crypto-currency.\n\nThe show is set in Miami and (surprise!) involves drug dealers and an FBI agent as well as a brilliant young Stanford drop-out, Izzy Morales, who tries to convince people how digital money will change the world.\n\nThe young coder is actually flogging something called \u201cGen-Coin,\u201d which she claims is better than the original bitcoin, but is based on the same idea of a decentralized digital currency beyond the reach of banks and governments. In Izzy\u2019s eyes, while money can corrupt people, the bigger issue is that \u201cpeople corrupt money.\u201d\n\nThis scene and other ones do a good job in portraying the philosophical case for digital money, as well as some of the technology involved. (Izzy\u2019s ex-boyfriend, for instance, is unhappy about the giant electricity bills she runs up.)\n\nStartup gets it tech cred in part because the producers retained a fin-tech consultant, Brian Stoeckert, who provided advice about the world of bitcoin as well as issues like money laundering and off-shore accounts. In an interview, Stoeckert said the writers and cast were brand new to bitcoin but soon came to understand it.\n\nAs for the show overall, I only watched the first episode but would give it a 7/10. The tech scenes are probably the best part, which is why it\u2019s a shame so much of the episode is consumed by drug cliches and superfluous sex scenes. It feels like being at a party where people keep taking their clothes off, though you wish you wouldn\u2019t. (You can read full reviews of Startup at the New York Times and Variety).\n\nStartup appears on Sony\u2019s streaming platform Crackle, best known for Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s Comedians in Cars, and also stars Martin Freeman of Fargo fame as a sensitive finance bro who decides to funnel his drug dealer daddy\u2019s money into Izzy\u2019s venture.\n\nThe show is unlikely be the definitive on-screen account of bitcoin. (For that we\u2019re going to have to wait for a studio to take on the saga of Dread Pirate Roberts and the Silk Road.) But it\u2019s worth a watch for anyone into tech and digital money.",

      "body": "<center>https://dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crisisinbound-676x374.jpg</center>\n\nIn past issues, we\u2019ve documented increasingly concerned billionaires warning of dangerous economic times. Many have favored gold as an alternative allocation in a world where $13 trillion-worth of debt is negative yielding, interest rates are artificially suppressed and we\u2019re on the brink of major wars.\n\nThe newest addition to this gold-loving billionaire's club, is none other than hedge-fund manager Paul Singer. At CNBC\u2019s Delivering Alpha Investors Conference this week, the founder of the $27-billion Elliott Management Fund, the 17th largest hedge fund in the world, mentioned that at current prices gold is \u201cundervalued\u201d and \u201cunderrepresented in many portfolios as the only ... store of value that has stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nSinger, along with numerous other hedge-fund managers, has been increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the Federal Reserve and other central banks for creating dangers in the market unlike any in what he terms the \u201c5,000 year-ish\u201d history of finance. Singer noted that \u201cit's a very dangerous time in the global economy and global financial markets.\"\n\nThis quote is frighteningly similar to the response given by Donald Trump on Fox Business not long ago when he was asked if he had money in the market. He answered, \u201cI did, but I got out,\u201d and then went on to say that he expected \u201cvery scary scenarios\u201d for investors.\n\nSinger also stated that he thinks owning medium- to long-term first world debt is a \u201creally bad idea\u201d... and then proceeded to tell listeners to sell their 30-year bonds.\n\nEarlier in the conference, prior to Singer, Ray Dalio who is the manager of the largest hedge fund in the world, Bridgewater Capital, was also vocal about the diminishing returns provided by government debt held by central banks. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can squeeze out of the debt cycle,\"  he said. He went on to say that central banks are at a point now where their ability to stimulate is limited.\n\nSeated next to Dalio was Former Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who voiced concern about limited  \u201ctools in the keynesian arsenal,\u201d that  probably wouldn\u2019t be enough to offset the next recession.\n\nGeithner obviously believes that a recession is on the way. Dalio and Singer are trying to convey the same message. A massive crunch is looming.\n\nWe agree with them, although we believe Geithner was sugarcoating what\u2019s to come.\n\nAfter all, we are on the precipice of a crash of biblical proportions according to the former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, William White.\n\nWe have mentioned his quote numerous time here at TDV but feel it\u2019s important to reiterate because of its magnitude: \u201cThe only question is whether we are able to look reality in the eye and face what is coming in an orderly fashion, or whether it will be disorderly. Debt jubilees have been going on for 5,000 years, as far back as the Sumerians.\u201d\n\nAs the Fed considers its second rate hike in 10 years, Singer condemned policy-makers for acting with \u201camazing arrogance\u201d when he and others had warned of a mortgage crisis prior to 2008.\n\nWhat he and those who agreed with his stance don\u2019t know, or at least won\u2019t state publicly, is that these shoddy central bank policies are detrimental by design. In other words, their sole purpose is to destabilize the world economy.\n\nThis deliberate market sabotage is necessary for the transference of power from the more developed nations to less developed ones. Ultimately, the idea is to eliminate smaller regional and national central banks. Once things get bad enough, these smaller banks will be blamed for provoking a given crisis.  And, secondarily, the end goal is to blow up the entire system in order to bring in the one world government and central bank.\n\nThe elites have used the same tactics time and time again throughout history. First, they create the problem, then there is a reaction, and then finally they come swooping in to \u201cvaliantly save\u201d the day. It's happened numerous times before.\n<center>https://dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1998_Time-MagCover_Greenspan-committe-save-world-The-Dollar-Vigilante.png</center>\nAnd it will soon happen again.\n\nOf course, the globalists have demonstrated that every intervention only makes situations worse.\n\nWe reported on the blatant thievery going on at Wells Fargo in our last article and noted how the elites were probably laughing hysterically at what they\u2019re able to get away with. They were even able to convince many younger American voters that \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d would be their savior, as seen by the significant, youthful support for Bernie Slanders. Debt and currency crises have already started to materialize, as we\u2019ve seen in the socialist utopia that is Venezuela. If this is any indication of what\u2019s to come, the future is looking awfully gloomy.\n\nAs Singer and others including Dalio have mentioned before, the most tried and true measure of wealth and value is gold.\n\nAt TDV we provide unique Austrian-economics based analysis from the anarcho-capitalist pespective of the state of the world\u2019s economy, as well as suggestions on how to protect your assets in these tempestuous and unprecedented times.\n\nJacob Rothschild, a member of the family partly responsible for the creation of all this chaos, even said himself that we are in \u201cuncharted waters\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to predict the unintended consequences of very low interest rates.\u201d\n\nWe have a pretty good idea of what the consequences will be and we\u2019re taking action to protect ourselves and even profit from them.  Rothschild seems to know the consequences, as well, as he has been buying up gold and selling the stock market and the US dollar.\n\nYou can survive and profit from the orchestrated collapse too.<a href=\"https://dollarvigilante.com/subscribe\"> Subscribe to TDV\u2019s newsletter here</a> to receive constantly updated information on how to protect your family and friends.\n\nIn the end, it is getting truly bizarre just how many billionaires, central bankers and others of note are all warning of the coming collapse. We\u2019d almost begun to worry that they were going to pull a switch-a-roo on us, but if you asked the great majority of investors and financial analysts, they\u2019ll tell you that they see nothing but smooth sailing ahead.\n\nSo, while many are warning, many are hearing, but not listening.  The bible said something about that, I believe.\n<center>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jeff-Berwick-The-Dollar-Vigilante-Steemit-Bio-1024x221.jpg</center>",

      "body": "# Is The Takeover of Crypto-Currencies About to Begin by the Central Banks?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NxCYMpy.png\n([Image Source](http://www.e-corp-usa.com/ecoin/))\n\nThe show **Mr. Robot** has fictionalized the **\"Powers that Shouldn't Be\"** into a singular Corporation called **E Corp**. This E Corp is supposed to basically represent the powers behind the Global Central Bankers, the true World Rulers. The head of E Corp even states in a recent Episode \"Politicians are Puppets\", which reminds me of the quotation by Nathan Rothschild regarding the head on which the crown of England is placed. Clearly one could see that E Corp in the show is the fictionalization of the **\"Illuminati\"** if you will. The show is heavily laden with [esoteric symbolism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2lZn-ZcJMs) but to the public it comes across as \"counter-culture\" as the main character is the founding member of **\"F Society\"** a hacking group based directly on **\"Anonymous\"**. This hacking group causes a financial crash, which leads to E Corp releasing a new digital Currency called **\"ECoin\"**, the above image is from a promotional website for the TV show. \n\n## Is Mr. Robot demonizing Crypto-Currencies? \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f6gXhrn.jpg\n([Image Source](http://www.serialminds.com/2015/06/05/mr-robot-la-serie-che-sta-piacendo-tutti-forse-troppo/))\n\nNow the interesting part for those fans of crypto-currencies like everyone on **Steemit** and for everyone who uses **Bitcoin**. I think the reason for they added an \"Ecoin\" in this show is to demonize crypto-currencies. The powers that shouldn't be have no way to take over these crypto-currencies so they have decided to wage information war against them. With the countless videos warning about the rise of *\"digital only currency\"* being the *\"mark of the beast\"*, one could easily see lots of propaganda has already been employed. However this new form is quite intelligent, by associating \"ECoins\" with \"E Corp\" they make the average mind (who doesn't know what Bitcoin or Steemit really is), subconsciously associate all crypto-currencies with the Federal Reserve banskters, with \"E Corp\". This is classic subconscious guilt by association created entirely by fiction that is often employed in fictional movies. This is why I think the \"E Coin\" was added to the show, but I could be wrong, so why else might it be in this show? \n\n## Do the Elite Plan to Replace the Dollar with a Digital Only Currency? \nhttp://i.imgur.com/IJJxcBR.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nWe all know the financial system is basically teetering on the verge of collapse. It is the biggest ponzy scheme ever devised and like all ponzy schemes if the Federal Reserve doesn't increase demand for the use of it's currency the system will collapse. It was designed to collapse. I believe like many others for one reason, so they can start the whole process that made them so rich, all over again on a global scale. The new world order if you will, being run by financial despotism and technical autocracy. So, is their plan to create a financial collapse being shown in plain sight in this show? One idea I heard from my friend who maintains the [\"What is Real\" YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/szymborski11) is they may \n>\"allow a false flag attack that they can blame on some shadowy hacking group, possibly even **Anonymous** itself as anyone can claim to be Anonymous\" \n\nPersonally I do not buy this theory as Anonymous is completely decentralized and would be almost impossible to blame for a false flag. However, to fully analyze a situation one must always look at every angle. \n\nSo if the system collapsed, especially overnight due to a hack, would they replace the Federal Reserve Notes with a new digital only \"E Coin\" backed by the IMF World Bank and their massive Gold Holdings, and Special Drawing Rights Holdings? The Group of Thirty, also known as the G30 reported in the [latest working papers on their website](http://group30.org/publications) that they want a return to a **GOLD Standard** just like how the Federal Reserve started out but in a new **Global Currency**. See my Documentary on the [\"Group of Thirty\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOB9QfxsgdQ) for more on this group of 30 Central Bankers that meet in secret. So is it out of the realm of possibilities that the new Global Currency that the World Bank has planned for post the collapse of the Federal Reserve System is a new digital only currency based on Gold and SDR holdings? No this would make a lot of sense to me but what do you the readers think? \n\n## Decentralization the Key to Defeating Takeover of Crypto-Currencies by Central Banks\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KVNo7nE.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nThe decentralized concept at the basis of the crypto-currencies could be the key to their survival if the Central Banks decide to try and take over the market. Right now their is a few crypto-currencies that are from the perspective of a non trader even worth mentioning. **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and **STEEM**, however if the Central Banks created a new \"ECoin\" it would easily make replace Bitcoin as the number 1 crypto-currency. However, there will always be a demand for crypto-currencies that are not \"Ecoins\", because thankfully we have a whole planet full of awesome people who will never conform to the system. The useless governments will always make things illegal that people want and can't buy with their new \"Ecoins\". So we will always have a demand for a currency like Bitcoin that is not a part of the centralized system, but is outside of that system's control. So try as they might, the powers that be can only wage information war against crypto-currencies because there will always be new entrepreneurs that create new currencies just like steemit, that are outside their systems of control. The harder the hidden hand squeezes the more of us will fall through their fingertips. \n\n#### Thanks for Reading! \nhttp://i.imgur.com/k10p6Pf.jpg\nIf you liked my article please join **steemit** and let me know by leaving a comment or upvoting!

      "body": "# Deciding to do some Trading with my SBD/BTC\n\nAfter having some mild success on steemit, I decided to transfer part of my SBD to Poloniex and try my hand at trading cryptocurrencies. It all kind of feels like free money anyway! I am just learning how cryptocurrencies work. I have been interested in bitcoin as a concept and aware of its success for about 2 years now, but never owned any until I ended up owning some SBD after stumbling upon steemit.\n\nAfter transferring to poloniex, I bought some BTC with my SBD. From there I transferred some BTC to a circle account and cashed out 20$ USD to my bank account just to prove to myself and everyone that keeps asking me, that I can easily use this cryptocurrency to get cash. But, the more I learn, the less fiat money I want and the more I want to invest in silver and cryptocurrencies. \n\n# Bitcoin\n\nI have regretted not being into bitcoin ever since I heard about it and started watching it go up and then especially after hearing Jeff Berwick talk positively about it at 200$ and then seeing it go over 500$. So I was happy to finally own some BTC but this is basically all an experiment for me so I decided that I might try to play the game a bit more.\n\n# Value of Steem Going Down\n\nI can see that my steemit wallet account value has been going down. I have powered up most of my SBD and I will continue to do so because I believe in steemit in the long term, but I do think I might be able to protect my SBD and maybe even profit with it by trading into BTC and buying cryptocurrencies on Poloniex so that's what I am experimenting with. I could also lose my investment so I am starting slowly and learning as much as I can for now.\n\n# Ethereum\n\n<p><center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/ETHEREUM-YOUTUBE-PROFILE-PIC.png</p></center>\n\n[image source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum)\n\nFrom my stock chart studying experience and from advice on the internet I decided to make a bet on ETH. I have heard more about Ethereum as I have been on steemit and after a short research session online I decided that it may go up soon, so I'll buy. Keep in mind, none of this very scientific, I am just playing around and learning how to do this and am not giving any advice because I really don't know what I'm doing! \n\nCurrently, I don't have time to constantly monitor close enough to day trade so I am only going to buy something that I think will be moving up over next few weeks. I make my guess based on what the technology is and by looking for trends in the charts. My chart studying skills are pretty basic. I look for floors, ceilings, and trends based on highs and lows over time. I look for upwards trends by spotting a series of higher lows and by watching for crosses in the moving averages. That's pretty much my entire strategy at this point\n\n# Trading so far\n\nHere is what I did yesterday. I turned 100 SBD into 0.13731732 BTC. I then transferred that bitcoin to my margin account after reading about how it worked on Poloniex's [margin trading page.](https://poloniex.com/support/aboutMarginTrading/) From there I was able to buy 0.33554217 BTC worth of Ethereum so now I have a position on 17.11149722 ETH.\n\nToday I have been researching other coins to invest in. I found [this quick list](http://www.alexfortin.com/top-5-crypto-currencies-invest-2016/#comments) helpful and I have noticed on my Poloniex margin trading account there are a few coins that I can take a margin position on. I also liked this [list of cryptos by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) Several of the coins are very volatile and some are making big moves while I watch them. Probably from some FOMO, I decided to go long on CLAMs. I liked that they just gave away coins to bitcoin holders so now they are the most widely held coin. I have no idea if this will be profitable, but I decided to go for it because it's so cheap!\n\n# Other Coins\n\nI also noticed that CLAMs are the crypto for a [gambling site](https://just-dice.com/) that was featured in a very positive [huffington post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gambling-done-fairly-how-virtual-currencies-help_us_57cf8253e4b0eb9a57b6a117) and is very active. I don't gamble much except a little poker now and then and I am definitely not promoting gambling, but I do recognize it as an industry that can help support a crypto. Basically I don't gamble unless I feel like I have an advantage. \n\n<p><center>http://clamclient.com/images/bio-photo.png</p></center>\n\n[image source](http://clamclient.com/)\n\nThe only reason I feel comfortable trying my hand at cryptocurrency trading is that I am using very small amounts of money that I earned from writing content in my spare time and I think the risk is worth the reward because I believe like many of you that cryptocurrency is the future of currency and if I get in on the right one early enough, there could be a nice profit. Now all I have to do is predict the future, lol.\n\nI have also noticed XRM making big upward swings today and I am considering playing with it but I am a bit weary putting much into coins that I don't really believe in. Yes I am doing this with CLAMs but I am going to keep this type of investment to a minimum. Still, I am open to any recommendations from any of you crypto traders out there might have.\n\n# Conclusions and Questions\n\nI have been teeter tottering between red and green on both of my positions but I feel confident that I will be able to close my positions at a profit at this point. I think I am going to stay long on Ethereum with most of my Poloniex account and move in and out of some small cap cryptos with a small percentage of my balance. But this is just my initial thoughts on my strategy so I am open to changing my entire strategy as I learn. The title is a serious question - Should I stay long on ETH??? It makes sense to me to do that but I could be missing something. Does anyone have any tips on coins that are going to make some big moves???\n\nI am a newbie at all this so please point out anything stupid I may be doing. I welcome any advice and suggestions that any of you might have. I'm also happy to answer any questions you might have if your like me and just getting started trading cryptos. I hope if nothing else, this post starts a conversation and something is learned. Thanks for reading. Let's make some money!\n\n# Links\n\n[Poloniex's margin trading page.](https://poloniex.com/support/aboutMarginTrading/) \n\n[gambling site for CLAMs](https://just-dice.com/)\n\n [huffington post article about that gambling site ^^^^^^^](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gambling-done-fairly-how-virtual-currencies-help_us_57cf8253e4b0eb9a57b6a117)\n\n[list of cryptos to consider for investment](http://www.alexfortin.com/top-5-crypto-currencies-invest-2016/#comments)\n\n[list of cryptos by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)",

Has somebody created a simple tool to enable a double spend?</center>\n\n<center>https://s11.postimg.org/icdsogk77/29e.jpg</center>\n##### <center>Free Bitcoin, YES!</center>\n- - - \n\nI'm guessing by now many of us have seen the video released earlier today;\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ysVCU1b-UBA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n... or read the articles that are circulating, regarding the supposed hack and tool that now allows you to simply and deliberately double-spend a bitcoin. A group of supposed \"South Korean\" hackers, who strangely seem very American seem to have put a lot of time and effort into creating a tool, website, and some marketing to discredit Bitcoin. They claim to be benevolent but its not hard to read between the lines to see a vested interest. \n- - -\n>Published on Sep 14, 2016\n\"Double-spending\" Bitcoin -- the process of making someone believe you sent them funds when you didn't -- used to be only for the tech-savvy. Thanks to Glass Hunt's new web-based double-spend tool, however, it's now easy and available to all. The South Korea-based anonymous hackers -- who actually want Bitcoin to succeed -- reveal their motives in this anonymous interview by Amanda B. Johnson.>\n- - -\n##### So...\nAnyway, the concept that a double spend could be initiated on zero confirmations transactions, seemed interesting enough and plausible enough to warrant further investigation. So I decided to follow the instructions in the video and try for myself.\n\n### <center>It all seems simple enough, just follow the guy on the video.</center>\n- - - \n# <center>3 Simple Steps:</center>\n<center>https://s17.postimg.org/6638czk4v/ds3.png</center>\n### <center>1. INITIALIZE</center>\n### <center>2. SEND FIRST BITCOIN</center>\n### <center>3. DOUBLE SPEND</center>\n- - -\n### <center>Step 1: Deposit some BTC into the Glass Hunt address given to initialize the process</center>\n<center>https://s17.postimg.org/htxa7j99r/ds2.png</center>\nI sent a small amount of Bitcoin to the address and after failing several times, it appeared in my Glass Hunt account. I was now ready to proceed to Step 2 and begin the double spend.\n\n- - -\n### <center>Step 2: Input the address where you would like to send the BTC</center>\n<center>https://s17.postimg.org/hfvy7xp67/image.png</center>\nI picked a random gaming site off the internet which accepted zero confirmation deposits and anonymity to begin gambling. I input the btc deposit address as per the instructions here...\n- - - \n### <center>Step 3:</center>\n...And that's where it ends...I can't make it past step 2 to step 3. It just keeps returning an error, and that is what it's been doing for the last 6 hours. I asked a fellow crypto associate to try the process, and they reported the same result, as do several of the comments appearing under the origonal YouTube clip which was posted.\n\nSo, is it a scam? It's too early to say for sure, or is it just somebody snubbing their nose at Bitcoin to leverage their own coin? Interested to know what others think of this situation. I have sent Glass Hunt an email and informing them of the error, and if they reply I will update this post accordingly.\n\n###### NB. I was attempting the double spend for research purposes and if successful, intended to return any coins which may have been gained as a result of the double spend.\n\nIf you would like to try for yourself then simply click on the link to go to- http://www.glasshunt.co/exploits/bitcoin-double-spend/\n\n\n\n**Click here to:** <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@bkkshadow\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/27/dd8bd8753d41da7.gif\" alt=\"dd8bd8753d41da7.gif\" border=\"0\"> </a>\n\n#bitcoin\n#cryptocurrency\n#hack",

Clelands keynote presentation was given at the second international workshop for <a href=\"http://blockchain.cs.ucl.ac.uk/p2pfisy-2016/\">P2P Financial Systems</a> in London on Sept. 8 and 9. The BoE co-sponsored the event with Bank of Canada, Deutsche Bundesbank, House of Finance, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and UCL Research Centre, bringing together scholars, regulators, and practitioners.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/bv582tdtr/image2.jpg\" width=\"907\" height=\"227\"/></center></p>\n<p>Cleland was appointed in March 2014, and her signature <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2015/031.aspx\">appears </a>on british banknotes. However, her role covers \u201cfar more than signing the banknotes,\u201d the Chief Cashier explains. \u201cI am responsible for meeting public demand for banknotes and maintaining confidence in the physical currency.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a September 2015 <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2015/speech838.pdf\">speech</a> at the University of the West of England in Bristol, Cleland stated that \u201calthough my team is responsible for a much older payment method, we are not luddites, and we welcome the additional choice and convenience that consumers can now enjoy.\u201d</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/k1x7ue3wf/image3.png\" width=\"270\" height=\"166\"/></center></p>\n<p>Cleland confirmed the Bank's research into the \u201cpotential breadth of access to CBDC\u201d at the workshop last week. She described two extreme possibilities; limiting access to only financial institutions, or giving access to everybody. The latter would allow businesses and households to \u201chold balances in central bank money and to pay each other in real time with full and final settlement, in an electronic format.\u201d Introducing a CBDC \u201ccould fundamentally change the structure of the financial system,\u201d where everyone currently uses commercial banks or other financial institutions to make electronic payments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/5k00meclb/image4.jpg\" width=\"906\" height=\"194\"/></center></p>\n<p>This is not the first time a central bank has contemplated competing with commercial banks. In November 2015, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/the-worlds-top-bank-weighs-in-on-digital-currencies/\">published a report on digital currencies</a> asserting that blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) \u201ccould present a hypothetical challenge to central banks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Increasing usage of the technology could reduce or even remove the functions of a central body. However, central banks have options to respond to the threat such as \u201cusing the technology itself to issue digital currencies,\u201d the BIS wrote.\u201cThe question is whether such digital liabilities should be issued using new technology and be made more widely available than at present.\u201d The BIS referenced the BoE and it\u2019s ongoing research.</p>\n<p>In March, the Bank's Deputy Governor of Monetary Policy, Dr. Ben Broadbent, gave a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech886.pdf\">speech</a> at the London School of Economics asserting that there are two major implications of CBDC that compete with commercial banks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/et26wilhb/image5.jpg\" width=\"907\" height=\"216\"/></center></p>\n<p>Currently, retail deposits at commercial banks are backed mainly by illiquid assets that cannot be sold on the open market. If all accounts are closed at once, banks wouldn\u2019t have the liquid resources to meet the demand. A central bank, on the other hand, \u201cholds only liquid assets on its balance sheet,\u201d Broadbent said, so they cannot run out of cash. However, he cautioned that \u201ctaking deposits away from banks could impair their ability to make the loans.\u201d</p>\n<p>In June, Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech914.pdf\">discussed</a> the prospect of CBDC for the UK at the Lord Mayor\u2019s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London. \u201cIn my view, still some way off,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/iqpglx8an/image6.jpg\" width=\"905\" height=\"224\"/></center></p>\n<p>A BoE staff working <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2016/swp605.pdf\">paper</a> on the macroeconomics of CBDC, published in July, suggests that it would be \u201ceconomically equivalent to the establishment of an online-only, reserve-backed, narrow bank alongside the existing commercial banking system.\u201d It would increase competition for deposit accounts and rapidly increase the adoption of innovative technologies and account offerings, the authors explained. CBDC could also have other advantages such as raising the country's GDP by as much as 3%, according to one of the models discussed in the paper.</p>\n<p>In a one-off inquiry into distributed ledger, or blockchain, technology at the House of Lords, also in July, a few industry experts participated including Dr. Catherine Mulligan, Research Fellow at Imperial College Centre for Cryptocurrency Research. \u201cIn terms of central bank crypto-backed fiat currency, it does have a potential impact on monetary policy,\u201d she told the Lords, citing its potential to move money away from commercial banks towards a central bank. \u201cIt's a matter of balance,\u201d she said. \u201cYou got to think about that carefully to make sure the commercial banks don't just collapse.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the same inquiry, Broadbent <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/house-of-lords-told-bank-of-englands-digital-currency-is-some-ways-off/\">reiterates</a> the prospect of CBDC substituting commercial bank money, but concurred with Carney that it\u2019s \u201csome way off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Any central banks issuing their own digital currencies would be directly competing with commercial banks, Senior Advisor to MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative, Michael Casey, <a href=\"http://www.dtcc.com/news/2016/april/19/analyzing-the-digital-currency-revolution\">explained</a> during the \u201cBitcoin and the Digital Currency Revolution\u201d panel at the DTCC Blockchain Symposium.\u201cWhy would you hand over money to a commercial bank with all the risk that entails without any of the benefits?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have people looking to store short-term custodial funds with a central bank.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/borizq4ov/image7.jpg\" width=\"909\" height=\"169\"/></center>\n<p>The BoE is not the only central bank to consider issuing their own digital currency. Bank of Canada has also<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/bank-of-canada-looking-into-issuing-digital-currency-1.2834759\">considered</a> issuing its own digital currency. One of the objectives in the Bank's <a href=\"http://www.bankofcanada.ca/research/bank-canada-medium-term-bank-wide-research-plan-2016-2018/\">Research Plan</a> for 2016-18 was investigating whether the Bank should issue its own digital currency and what it would look like. In June, the Bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1117c780-3397-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153\">reportedly</a> gave a private presentation in Calgary unveiling its project to develop an electronic version of the Canadian dollar using a token named CAD-Coin.</p>\n<p>Digital currency is also in the works in China. In February, Zhou Xiaochuan, People's Bank of China Governor,<a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/china-considers-digital-currency/\">revealed</a> that \u201cDigital currency will co-exist with cash for quite a long time before it finally replaces cash.\" However, \u201cwith the transaction costs of paper money rising, people will be motivated to opt more for digital money,\u201d he believes.</p>\n<p>Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), is also actively studying its own prototype cryptocurrency,\u2018DNBCoin.\u2019 In June, the bank <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/dutch-central-banks-third-dnbcoin-prototype-delves-into-smart-contracts-and-trusted-ownership/\">unveiled three models of the Coin</a>.</p>\n<p>According to an August World Economic Forum report, <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Industry-Reports-2016/WEF-The-future-of-financial-infrastructure.pdf\">over 90 central banks are engaged in DLT discussions</a>. The total DLT investments have exceeded US$ 1.4 billion over the past 3 years from over 24 countries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/bfyjnjha7/image8.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"294\"/></center></p>\n<p>While central banks are researching DLT as a way to issue digital currencies, \u201ccould, and should CBDC be delivered using DLT and is this technology the best way to achieve the necessary scalability and resilience?\u201d Cleland concluded her speech. \u201cWe also need to understand the technology options.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>This article can be found on our website on</strong> <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/bank-of-england-states-central-bank-issued-digital-currency-will-compete-with-commercial-banks/\"><strong>this link</strong></a><strong>. &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>According to the</strong><a href=\"http://www.bravenewcoin.com/markets\"><strong> BNC indices</strong></a><strong>, at the time of writing:</strong><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.bravenewcoin/steem\">Steem</a> was trading at <strong>$0.53692706</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a> was trading at <strong>$605.91</strong><br>\n</p>\n<h3>If you enjoyed this article, remember to <a href=\"http://www.steemit.com/@bravenewcoin\">FOLLOW</a> and SHARE our daily content!</h3>\n</html>",

      "body": "<center>https://s11.postimg.org/v65yywpb7/bitfinex40.png</center>\n\n### Hi Steemians! This is small analysis of a potential investment opportunity in iFinex Inc. the corporate entity behind the world known trading platform Bitfinex. First some facts:\n\n### BFX Tokens\nAfter the Bitfinex security breach that occurred on August 2, 2016, Bitfinex issued tokens representing their clients losses at a face value of $1 dollar, this means that if you lost $400 dollars you would be credited 400 BFX Tokens with the promise that Bitfinex would do everything possible to redeem the tokens at its face value of $1 dollar as soon as possible.\n\n### BFX Token Trading\nA couple of days after the platform resumed operations after the hack, the trading of the BFX token was enabled under some [terms and conditions](https://www.bitfinex.com/bfx_token_terms). This meant that by then you could sell your tokens at the market value and recover a percentage of what you lost OR you could also buy the token as a long term investment if you were confident that Bitfinex was going to redeem them soon. The BFX token started trading at $0.30 USD and from then it has gone up to $0.619 (price at the moment of writing this article).\n\n<center>https://s17.postimg.org/nsvokdycf/bfxusdchart.png\nBFXUSD 6hr candle chart for the past month.\n</center>\n\n### BFX Tokens Redemption\nBitfinex announced there would be 3 possible ways the company would be redeeming the BFX tokens\n- Equity conversion\n- Raising new capital through equity financing\n- Operating Profits\n\n### Special Purpose Vehicle for Equity conversion\n**Here is where it gets interesting**, on August 22nd, Bitfinex started coordinating with BnkToTheFuture in order to launch a SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) that would allow the conversion of BFX tokens to equity stakes in iFinex (the company behind Bitfinex). 5 days ago Bitfinex finally revealed some details about this equity conversion:\n- Redemption of BFX for the beneficial interest in iFinex will be done at BFX\u2019s face value of $1 US Dollar.\n- Participation in the SPV will be limited to holders of a minimum of 1,000 BFX tokens.\n\n<center>https://s9.postimg.org/e1jbvmyjj/letter.png</center>\n\n### Bitfinex remains a Profitable company and the most complex Trading Platform.\nEven though the trading volume suffered a big drop after the security breach, it has been recovering since then. The sole fact of seeing this trading volume in their platform immediately after the hack shows how confident people are that this will not happen again. Something what we should keep in mind is that Bitfinex continues to be most complex Trading Platform for the trading pairs that they offer, they have margin trading, margin funding and several other features in their platform. I also think that the trading volume will not go anywhere but up because people will slowly regain confidence on the platform as the time goes by.\n\n<center>https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/4/005/0aa/28b/3d33285.jpg</center>\n\n## IFINEX INC. EQUITY AT 40% DISCOUNT!\nSince the BFX tokens equity conversion would be done at their face value of $1 US Dollar and at the moment of writing, the BFX token is trading at $0.618 USD, if you are confident on the future success of Bitfinex and are willing to invest on it, you could buy BFX tokens right now and once the SVP for equity conversion is live you would be **getting iFinex equity at a 38% discount!**\n\nMy thoughts are that once the SVP is officially announced, the BFX Token price could easily go up to $0.70 or $0.80 and once the SVP is live for equity conversion it could get really close to its face value, why? well simply because there will be a lot of investors out there trying to get Bitfinex equity at a discount. Also since the BFX Token would be the only way of getting iFinex Inc. equity (since equity could not be available through regular USD), we could even see the BFX Token price go pass its face value if there are a lot of investors confident on Bitfinex and wanting to get a piece of the cake. Of course this all depends on the actual terms and conditions of the SVP and the offered Equity.\n\n### Any thoughts?\nI am really interested on hearing your thoughts about this? What do you think about this opportunity? Would you invest in Bitfinex even after they suffered a security breach? Do you think the platform still has potential? After all, like I mentioned before, it remains the most complex Bitcoin Trading Platform out there. I think this all depends on whether you think the company will be successful in the long term or not.\n\n### Disclaimer\nThis is in no way an investment advice nor an attempt of pumping the BFX token value, this is merely the presentation of the facts and an attempt to know your thoughts about this potential investment opportunity.\n\n### Hope you find this analysis interesting and that you decide to share your thoughts on this. Thanks for reading and bye for now.",

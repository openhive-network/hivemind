I almost died when I didn't have my professional camera on me for this, its just too beautiful.</p>\n<p>http://67.media.tumblr.com/795b5b062abdc52a141feb90fa6bfae1/tumblr_ocjka4EIR51u2s84ro1_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>This photo was taken with my iphone 6, the clouds were legit that colour at sunset. It was absolutely amazing. If you have the change to visit Lussier hot springs in BC Canada do it. This is the lake just up the road where you can camp and there is another lake just five minutes further called White Swan Lake. The drive here is a bit dangerous, up a mountain cliff with a skinny road and no side rails...but besides that its magical! This was my camp view no joke... travelling for cheap and still in paradise. :)</p>\n<p>Always,</p>\n<p>Kristylynn</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Sometimes I ask myself, why did I choose this? What in my life brought me to this place where capturing images is my profession. Even though I have struggled so much why do I still love it?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Photography is something I can't live without. The ability to capture and create is thrilling! I love shooting, editing the images, connecting with people... I could go on and on. I actually sometimes think I like the people part of it more then all the technical photography mumbo jumbo, I just see the camera as a way to connect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am specifically drawn to people, if you look at any of my posts that is what I do for the most part. There is a magic in capturing someone, and in a way they may not see themselves. I specialize somewhere in the lifestyle, fashion, boudoir, portrait area...sometimes I am not sure exactly what to call it. My subjects are not professional models and nothing I have made has been for a commercial company. Not saying I would not love to do that but my focus is on your every day person. My goal is to create a concept, mood or theme and produce images where my client looks stunning while getting the vision and purpose for the shoot across. \u00a0Simple enough right? ...</p>\n<p>https://65.media.tumblr.com/3ce14701945fcf5daa3f1bc685a8c954/tumblr_ob37a4p73s1u2s84ro3_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>I had this awesome client (above), we called this her Beyonce shoot. She is in her 40's, she's a mom and said at this point in her life she feels fierce and she wants to express that. \u00a0It can be scary putting yourself out like this, getting your hair and makeup done, getting in front of the camera and then trusting that no matter how goofy you are feeling I am directing you properly. But she did it! When the shoot was done, and she had not even seen any pictures yet she went on and on about how empowered she felt and how excited she was that she did the session. Just the session itself and how she felt after was already worth it. It is like putting on a costume you have always wanted to wear for a day, or dress like and act out some kind of part of your personality that in your day to day life you may not be able to show. When she saw her images she was so excited and wanted to share them everywhere and talk about her experience! \u00a0(permission granted :) I never post things without consent).\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://67.media.tumblr.com/62deb177d11c15e6e860262726c568ce/tumblr_ob37a4p73s1u2s84ro1_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>I believe in making people feel beautiful, and finding beauty. As a photographer I think my job is to find beauty in everyone, the things no one sees or may not be looking at. How that light is touching someones cheek, or how their lips are slightly open and pouty and it looks perfect. What is the part of them that is amazing?\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote><strong>&quot;Beauty, to me, is about being comfortable in your own skin. That, or a kick-ass red lipstick.&quot; - Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></blockquote>\n<p>For anyone who struggles in a profession you love I hear you. I battle with more then just trying to get my business going, what gear to use, what are popular photographers doing, etc. I am always trying to figure out why I am doing this and what value do I want to bring to people. At the end of the day it really does have to mean something to me at my very core, its like I want the people I shoot to understand that as well. I just want to make them feel really amazing and in a selfish way it makes me feel amazing too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is beauty in everyone, please just take a second to look.</p>\n<p>Always,</p>\n<p>Kristylynn</p>\n<p><br /></p>",

I've learned more about crypto, other people, new ideas and I'm not going to lie I'm a bit addicted. Im just happy there is something that exists for content creators where you can share and speak about whatever you want. You can be unfiltered and not worried about &quot;controversial content&quot; because it will make someone else mad or &quot;what if my following doesn't like this&quot; or &quot;is this appropriate for my personal brand&quot;. I am not saying don't focus on something specific if that's what you want to do, but for once I want the rules to be thrown out the window and be in a place where you can speak freely.\u00a0I feel bogged down by posts like &quot;how to get more likes&quot; &quot;how to get more followers&quot; &quot;how to attract people to your whatever&quot;. Sure there is some skill in creating attention grabbing content but as soon as I begin to think about that I feel like the flow is turned off, like the tap into my thoughts and what I want to say is clogged full of doubt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://66.media.tumblr.com/30f19780eafa38de0a6223e662fccdb7/tumblr_oaxpnilENH1u2s84ro4_1280.jpg</p>\n<p><br />\nI don't want to only talk about photos because I am a photographer or only post pictures because that is what I am good at. I want to learn and try different things. You know what I am not good at? this! Writing and expressing my thoughts is scary for me! I have barely even written in a journal, my website blog is images and I write as little as I can. Honestly because it is something I have never done and I don't even know if I am good at it! I am also constantly afraid to write the wrong thing or not be able to properly express myself. The idea of blogging and not feeling like I have to fit into a certain niche or impress a specific audience to be popular is thrilling. I am not worried about censoring myself or my experience, I want to read about others with an open mind while they also speak freely, create and share ideas. Some will be liked my the masses and some won't and thats okay.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><br />\nMaybe I am out to lunch but if there is something I want Steemit to be I would like it to be is a place that feels like freedom. Freedom of opinions without consequences, and I'm not talking here about being a terrible person or posting awful hateful things. But if your mad let hear why, if you think this certain thing is the best thing ever then say why. I would love a place where I can read about people. On a level though that isn't covered by what you think you should do or what you think will be popular. I think sharing yourself has value. Who are you? What do you do? What knowledge do you have?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://67.media.tumblr.com/e09da9a5d8c25fdba7c9e2b7e1a9c551/tumblr_oaxpnilENH1u2s84ro1_1280.jpg</p>\n<p><br />\nWe are so used to being told no, or do it this way. How jealous do people get being on things like Instagram and you have 150 followers and how does that person have 25000. They must be so cool or have something I don't or whatever your thinking and then you feel bad about what you are doing or you just stop creating all together because you only got one thumbs up. Everything popular on there is all starting to look the same. Its a strange time and place we are in, but I think with something like Steemit we have more control over shaping what we want and creating support, or at least I hope so. I don't want the Kim Kardashians of the world to be top trending on here because they got butt lifts, or Buzzfeed telling me the top things guys like in girls, or and endless sea of memes. Make something yourself, speak about you, you are more interesting then all of that.\u00a0Im excited about where this can go lets be excited together. (Below I am trying to show a happy dance ;))</p>\n<p>https://67.media.tumblr.com/4718f307f9e474a51ec3a87898f2abbf/tumblr_oaxpnilENH1u2s84ro5_1280.jpg</p>\n<p><br />\nLike what you like, feel how you feel and speak about what really makes you tick. Art, money, technology... the sunset, the last book you read. Heck! We can learn so much from each others stories while supporting the things we really connect to. What is better then that? At the moment I am not sure. I hope you enjoyed reading and if you got this far I'd love to hear what you think.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><br />\nAlways,<br />\nKristylynn\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://65.media.tumblr.com/652de02a7164e87ddfd74b42226847b3/tumblr_oaxpnilENH1u2s84ro6_1280.jpg</p>",

However I guess it is good to snap some pictures of things you wouldn't normally. This may not be the most adventurous and original animal to photograph but I did interrupted my cats sweet and lazy life to get her to be my model. So in saying that here is my submission!<br>\n(40mm f4 Canon 6D with a bit of Lightroom edit)</p>\n<p>Animal Portrait:</p>\n<p>https://66.media.tumblr.com/d0886a11a01cadad1ebf54ff5aae0cdb/tumblr_oasredZds91u2s84ro2_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>I have to say it was fun, but what made me laugh most like the crazy cat lady I am was the pictures that didn't work. So I figured I would share some of those as well just for fun.</p>\n<p>Outtake #1: Cat trying to get away</p>\n<p>https://67.media.tumblr.com/af3166df59920a003cbecdbaff991c7f/tumblr_oasredZds91u2s84ro4_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>Outtake #2: Unimpressed cat</p>\n<p>https://66.media.tumblr.com/599134a1e1fb6e23cd089e1ba2a17ac4/tumblr_oasredZds91u2s84ro1_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>Outtake #3: I'm hungry and sleepy so f*ck off</p>\n<p>https://66.media.tumblr.com/8cfcc17b4a9e5a5e7d31a941cfb01db7/tumblr_oasredZds91u2s84ro3_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>By the way her name is Mika, I guess I should introduce her and not just call her cat. After all she did have a very important role and deserves some credit. Yah know I've always told her to get a job to help pay rent so I feel like this was just a long time coming and being a model isn't the worst gig.</p>\n<p>https://66.media.tumblr.com/11d08a7398512d87ae80464c85c5c44e/tumblr_oasredZds91u2s84ro5_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>I look forward to the next photo challenge. This was fun and a great way to get people involved and posting. What are you thinking next?! Please just don't say babies.</p>\n<p>Kristylynn xo<br>\n</p>\n</html>",

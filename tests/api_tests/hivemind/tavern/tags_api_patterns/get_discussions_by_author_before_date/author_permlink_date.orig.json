    "body": "<html>\n<p>Hello Steemit friends,</p>\n<p>I have missed you even though I have intentionally been avoiding being connected for parts of the summer. No matter how much I like and enjoy all the internet has to offer I often find myself getting a little too wrapped up in it and need a break sometimes. Really its me not you...</p>\n<p>https://67.media.tumblr.com/1d3a70a5e553ba17aba3b3c54076dadd/tumblr_ocubh194Jq1u2s84ro3_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>So it is still summer where I live but already does not feel like it. Alberta is mean like that... you think its still hot and then all of a sudden its fall when it should still be summer. I always hope to get to the end of August before feeling cooler nights but that is always high hopes. My summer easy goingness is slowly floating away as I pull out my knitted sweaters. This is the time of year I try to run back to the mountains one more time, I call it chasing summer. There is a place called the Shushwaps in BC and when it is chilly here, you might still get one more really hot weekend there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have been a bit MIA on Steemit since I first started and got excited about it but this is why: I have been having an amazing summer! I actually have so many things to tell you guys about. So all adventures this year have been road trips and they all have landed me in places with some to no cellphone reception which as I said before it really feels amazing to disconnect but now it is time to share!</p>\n<p>https://68.media.tumblr.com/3d4d8c3e62f015a0cd7169d75f3c383a/tumblr_ocubh194Jq1u2s84ro2_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>Earlier this summer in July me and my boyfriend packed up my little car last minute and went to a place called Lussier Hot Springs, if you have not been here before it is amazing. There are three pools of hot water coming out of the mountain rocks. So the top pool being the hottest, flowing down into the second pool, then the bottom pool which is right by a river is the coolest. And yes! there is also a river! Mountains, trees, hot springs and a fresh cool river. I don't have my own picture of this, bringing my phone was too risky to me but I did find this one online to show you kind of what it looks like:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.explore-mag.com/media/image/40575_max.jpg</p>\n<p>(www.explore-mag.com)</p>\n<p>Camping there is also amazing if you ever get the chance, there are two lakes up the road from the hot springs, here is a picture of the sunset right form our camp spot in the trees. It is a must go spot.&nbsp;Also the sunset that night was absolutely insane, I can't belive how bright that red/pink light is.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://66.media.tumblr.com/2a68ba3a484a0d7ecac3d5a73f1dc662/tumblr_ocubh194Jq1u2s84ro4_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>Another really amazing thing that we have been doing this summer is finding spring water. Between the two lakes running down the mountain side was the best natural spring water I have ever had. Actually as soon as I drank some I felt like I had super powers. If you have access to water like this I definitely recommend it. There is a great website called findaspring.com and you can find your location and see if people have posted any in your area. So really for days straight we just drank spring water and went in the natural hot springs. The trip was cheap but that is a version of luxury to me!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb81971cc873c55cf87b08acc201abd3/tumblr_ocubh194Jq1u2s84ro7_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>Our second adventure was to a festival called Shambhala, it is in Salmo BC, Canada. If you have never been it is quite the experience and worth the trip (pun intended). We were there four nights, getting there on a Thursday just before everything started on the Friday. Shambhala is an electronic music festival and features some really amazing DJ's. My favourite part about this whole festival is how beautiful the land is, there are so many trees and a river you can swim in, you are free to just roam and be free in the woods. Besides music there are speakers, classes, art... so much art. If you need some inspiration this place is magical. It holds space for people to really be themselves and explore. Through the forest everything is lit up with lamps, tree lights, it is like your in a magical forest. I only went for the first time in 2015, and when we got in at night and walked into where all the stages were it was like I was on another planet. It was just magic and its the only way I can describe it. Next year is the 20th anniversary and if you want more information on the festival here is the link - http://www.shambhalamusicfestival.com/about/&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://68.media.tumblr.com/b963fe8fee14240daabb228b0cb2ad8a/tumblr_ocubh194Jq1u2s84ro5_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d6e9726fe79a6fd9b401fddb03ff830/tumblr_ocubh194Jq1u2s84ro6_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>I am hoping I have more interesting things to talk about more soon. I am planning a year of work and travel. The first part however I need a bit more secure is the work. Freelance photography is a tough gig sometimes! I will also bring my professional camera and take much better images :) everything in this post was my iphone since I didn't want to take my camera with me on that trip (however iphone photography is really fun!). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://66.media.tumblr.com/4cdc4413aac311d3c4f05ec645fad50e/tumblr_ocubh194Jq1u2s84ro1_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>(iphone - 5am foggy morning walking back to sleep after a crazy night of shambhala)</p>\n<p>I hope everyone has been enjoying their summer and I am glad to be posting again. Please follow if you like my stuff and I look forward much more Steemit time with you all!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Always,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kristylynn</p>\n</html>",

It was absolutely amazing. If you have the change to visit Lussier hot springs in BC Canada do it. This is the lake just up the road where you can camp and there is another lake just five minutes further called White Swan Lake. The drive here is a bit dangerous, up a mountain cliff with a skinny road and no side rails...but besides that its magical! This was my camp view no joke... travelling for cheap and still in paradise. :)</p>\n<p>Always,</p>\n<p>Kristylynn</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Sometimes I ask myself, why did I choose this? What in my life brought me to this place where capturing images is my profession. Even though I have struggled so much why do I still love it?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Photography is something I can't live without. The ability to capture and create is thrilling! I love shooting, editing the images, connecting with people... I could go on and on. I actually sometimes think I like the people part of it more then all the technical photography mumbo jumbo, I just see the camera as a way to connect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am specifically drawn to people, if you look at any of my posts that is what I do for the most part. There is a magic in capturing someone, and in a way they may not see themselves. I specialize somewhere in the lifestyle, fashion, boudoir, portrait area...sometimes I am not sure exactly what to call it. My subjects are not professional models and nothing I have made has been for a commercial company. Not saying I would not love to do that but my focus is on your every day person. My goal is to create a concept, mood or theme and produce images where my client looks stunning while getting the vision and purpose for the shoot across. \u00a0Simple enough right? ...</p>\n<p>https://65.media.tumblr.com/3ce14701945fcf5daa3f1bc685a8c954/tumblr_ob37a4p73s1u2s84ro3_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>I had this awesome client (above), we called this her Beyonce shoot. She is in her 40's, she's a mom and said at this point in her life she feels fierce and she wants to express that. \u00a0It can be scary putting yourself out like this, getting your hair and makeup done, getting in front of the camera and then trusting that no matter how goofy you are feeling I am directing you properly. But she did it! When the shoot was done, and she had not even seen any pictures yet she went on and on about how empowered she felt and how excited she was that she did the session. Just the session itself and how she felt after was already worth it. It is like putting on a costume you have always wanted to wear for a day, or dress like and act out some kind of part of your personality that in your day to day life you may not be able to show. When she saw her images she was so excited and wanted to share them everywhere and talk about her experience! \u00a0(permission granted :) I never post things without consent).\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://67.media.tumblr.com/62deb177d11c15e6e860262726c568ce/tumblr_ob37a4p73s1u2s84ro1_1280.jpg</p>\n<p>I believe in making people feel beautiful, and finding beauty. As a photographer I think my job is to find beauty in everyone, the things no one sees or may not be looking at. How that light is touching someones cheek, or how their lips are slightly open and pouty and it looks perfect. What is the part of them that is amazing?\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote><strong>&quot;Beauty, to me, is about being comfortable in your own skin. That, or a kick-ass red lipstick.&quot; - Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></blockquote>\n<p>For anyone who struggles in a profession you love I hear you. I battle with more then just trying to get my business going, what gear to use, what are popular photographers doing, etc. I am always trying to figure out why I am doing this and what value do I want to bring to people. At the end of the day it really does have to mean something to me at my very core, its like I want the people I shoot to understand that as well. I just want to make them feel really amazing and in a selfish way it makes me feel amazing too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is beauty in everyone, please just take a second to look.</p>\n<p>Always,</p>\n<p>Kristylynn</p>\n<p><br /></p>",

I've learned more about crypto, other people, new ideas and I'm not going to lie I'm a bit addicted. Im just happy there is something that exists for content creators where you can share and speak about whatever you want. You can be unfiltered and not worried about &quot;controversial content&quot; because it will make someone else mad or &quot;what if my following doesn't like this&quot; or &quot;is this appropriate for my personal brand&quot;. I am not saying don't focus on something specific if that's what you want to do, but for once I want the rules to be thrown out the window and be in a place where you can speak freely.\u00a0I feel bogged down by posts like &quot;how to get more likes&quot; &quot;how to get more followers&quot; &quot;how to attract people to your whatever&quot;. Sure there is some skill in creating attention grabbing content but as soon as I begin to think about that I feel like the flow is turned off, like the tap into my thoughts and what I want to say is clogged full of doubt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://66.media.tumblr.com/30f19780eafa38de0a6223e662fccdb7/tumblr_oaxpnilENH1u2s84ro4_1280.jpg</p>\n<p><br />\nI don't want to only talk about photos because I am a photographer or only post pictures because that is what I am good at. I want to learn and try different things. You know what I am not good at? this! Writing and expressing my thoughts is scary for me! I have barely even written in a journal, my website blog is images and I write as little as I can. Honestly because it is something I have never done and I don't even know if I am good at it! I am also constantly afraid to write the wrong thing or not be able to properly express myself. The idea of blogging and not feeling like I have to fit into a certain niche or impress a specific audience to be popular is thrilling. I am not worried about censoring myself or my experience, I want to read about others with an open mind while they also speak freely, create and share ideas. Some will be liked my the masses and some won't and thats okay.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><br />\nMaybe I am out to lunch but if there is something I want Steemit to be I would like it to be is a place that feels like freedom. Freedom of opinions without consequences, and I'm not talking here about being a terrible person or posting awful hateful things. But if your mad let hear why, if you think this certain thing is the best thing ever then say why. I would love a place where I can read about people. On a level though that isn't covered by what you think you should do or what you think will be popular. I think sharing yourself has value. Who are you? What do you do? What knowledge do you have?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://67.media.tumblr.com/e09da9a5d8c25fdba7c9e2b7e1a9c551/tumblr_oaxpnilENH1u2s84ro1_1280.jpg</p>\n<p><br />\nWe are so used to being told no, or do it this way. How jealous do people get being on things like Instagram and you have 150 followers and how does that person have 25000. They must be so cool or have something I don't or whatever your thinking and then you feel bad about what you are doing or you just stop creating all together because you only got one thumbs up. Everything popular on there is all starting to look the same. Its a strange time and place we are in, but I think with something like Steemit we have more control over shaping what we want and creating support, or at least I hope so. I don't want the Kim Kardashians of the world to be top trending on here because they got butt lifts, or Buzzfeed telling me the top things guys like in girls, or and endless sea of memes. Make something yourself, speak about you, you are more interesting then all of that.\u00a0Im excited about where this can go lets be excited together. (Below I am trying to show a happy dance ;))</p>\n<p>https://67.media.tumblr.com/4718f307f9e474a51ec3a87898f2abbf/tumblr_oaxpnilENH1u2s84ro5_1280.jpg</p>\n<p><br />\nLike what you like, feel how you feel and speak about what really makes you tick. Art, money, technology... the sunset, the last book you read. Heck! We can learn so much from each others stories while supporting the things we really connect to. What is better then that? At the moment I am not sure. I hope you enjoyed reading and if you got this far I'd love to hear what you think.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><br />\nAlways,<br />\nKristylynn\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://65.media.tumblr.com/652de02a7164e87ddfd74b42226847b3/tumblr_oaxpnilENH1u2s84ro6_1280.jpg</p>",

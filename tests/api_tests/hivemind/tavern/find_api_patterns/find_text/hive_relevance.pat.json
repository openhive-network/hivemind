    "body": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Bee-apis.jpg\n\nBefore I start, let's talk about why we should raise bees. Honey is a great reason, as there is nothing that beats your own homemade honey, but there are other things the bees also produce. For example, they produce beeswax, which you can use to make your own candles and beauty products. Pollination is also a good reason to have bees, as if you have a small garden it can produce lots of products due to the large amount of bees that will pollinate it. A final reason to do some beekeeping is that bees are very independent, and do not require a lot of maintenance. However, there are a few cons to look into as well. The first, and most major one is probably the fact that bees can sting. Another issue is the cost of supplies, and sometimes when beekeeping, the first year does not go very well.\n\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2013/08/07/20/13/bee-170551_960_720.jpg\n\nSo, let's get started! But before we do that, make sure that you check the local laws. Some places do not allow beekeeping. Also, know that bees take the quickest path from one location to another, known as a beeline, and that they may defecate in midair. When choosing a place to put a hive, try to make it in an open space, and let it get a little bit of sunlight (not too much). The best place to put a hive is in a sheltered area, not a hilltop as those are too windy. As you may know, nectar comes from different kinds of flowers. In fact, honey may taste very different depending on which kinds of flowers are the main source for the nectar that the bees bring back to the hive. Be careful about pesticides, as they can kill bees, and if they don't initially and the bee brings it back it can kill other bees or even the queen bee.\n\nhttp://www.almanac.com/sites/default/files/d6/images/bee-clothing.jpeg\n\nThere is quite a bit of equipment that you will need to start beekeeping. The first major piece of equipment is beekeeping clothing. You need to have proper protection from the bees, or else you may get stung. Generally, for a beginner, a veil is important, along with sting proof gloves and sting proof clothing that covers your entire body. Other than the hive, which I will discuss later, you will need something called a smoker, which produces smoke and help the bees calm down. You will also need something called a hive tool, which is used to loosen the frames and the boxes that bees are in. One of the last tools you will need is something called the uncapping knife, which is used uncap wax cells where the honey is stored. There are plenty of places that you can go to to purchase beekeeping equipment.\n\nAnother thing to consider before buying the bees themselves is a hive. The most common hive for beginners is a hive that uses the Langstroth method.\nhttp://www.almanac.com/sites/default/files/d6/images/langstrothHiveIllus.gif\nYou don't really need to worry about how to exactly build it though, as there are many kits for sale that are under $150. There are a few things to consider about the exact location of the hive. One important one is that it can be warmed by the morning sun. It should also be sheltered from the wind. A beehive needs to be near a source of water, as bees also need to drink. The beehive should be painted white or black, depending on where you live, but never with a toxic paint. To prevent bees from being a nuisance, there should be a fence around nearby street locations so that the bees fly over it.\n\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2016/04/14/14/18/silk-bee-1328961_960_720.jpg\n\nAfter you have built a beehive, you will need to find some bees. Bees are very social creatures, and that is why it is important to know the basics of bee society. There are three main levels of bees: the worker, the drone, and the queen. Worker bees are females and are responsible for things like tending to the hive, its queen, guarding the hive's entrance, and collecting food. Drones are the males, and the only thing they need to do is mate with the queen. The queen herself is responsible for the genetic traits found withing a colony. To get bees, you can go through the wild and search for clusters of bees called swarms. If these swarms are on a tree limb, it is best to cut the entire limb and gently shake the bees into a container. Bees on a flat surface can be guided with a piece of cardboard, or some smoke behind them. However, by getting these bees for free, they may have certain diseases or have poor genetic material, resulting in weak bees. You should also be careful with regards to property laws, as taking a beehive on someone else's property may be considered stealing.\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFqrbPdZuTA/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nThere are two main ways in which you can buy bees, which are in a package or a nucleus. The package method comes stocked with some worker bees, a queen bee, and some sweet syrup for the bees to eat out of. Here is where you make an important decision: How to introduce the bees to the queen. There are two main methods, the indirect method and the direct method. In the indirect method, the bees eat their way through food to get to the queen and slowly get used to her. This method is safer but may take longer. The direct method is to let out the queen bee directly into the hive, but the bees may attack her and destroy the hive. However, if the bees do not attack her, or the queen survives the attack, it may be faster than the indirect method, but it is also more risky. The other kind of thing that you can buy is a nucleus, which is already a small, fully functioning hive. You may, however, run into the fact that the queen is a weak or old queen, resulting in poor honey production and weak bees.\n\nhttps://www.farminguk.com/images/News/20600_1.jpg\n\nBefore you can start harvesting the liquid-gold that bees make, you need to know about some diseases that bees can catch. Here are the most common ones: Varroa Mites, which are parasites that attack both the larvae and adult bees. A medicine called Apistan appears to work well on them. Foulbrood is a virus that can deform and kill sealed broods of honeybees. CCD, or colony collapse disorder, is when bees just start leaving the hive. There is no cure for it, but some researchers have found that it is caused by both of fungus and a certain virus being present. When winter comes, you may want to wrap up your beehive, but make sure that the bees are not literally trapped in the hive.\n\nhttps://zeebeeman.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/honey-harvest.jpg\n\nSo, now you have the bees, which means that you have honey. Before you start harvesting honey by yourself, it is recommended that you go out with an expert for a few times to get the hang of it. Generally, there is a basic process of collecting honey. You need to make sure that you use small, gentle movement instead of large ones when collecting honey. The first step is get the bees off of the supers (a special layer in the bee hive). Try not to use smoke, as this may affect the taste of the honey. The next step is to remove the supers, and get the honey out of them. This can be done by uncapping the wax on the combs, or by purchasing a special extractor or centrifuge to make it easier. After this is done, you should strain the honey through cheesecloth to remove excess wax. Keep the honey in a settling tank to allow air bubbles to go up and bring foreign object with them, making those objects easier to remove. Then, you will need to skim off the foam. After you figure out which temperature you can store the honey at, you can start bottling it and then start selling it!\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial.

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Feeling stylish and always a little sexy in my beekeepers garb, I grab my smoker in one hand and my hive tool in the other and bounce like Tigger out into my beloved bee-yard. &nbsp;The apiary is no longer the two original hives -- expansion was inevitable. On this day, we are sitting pretty at 7 hives. &nbsp;&nbsp;Temperatures reaching into the 90's with some notable humidity, I feel simple pure joy as I remove the bricks from the top of the hive and pry off the first of the hive covers. &nbsp;I'm immediately met with a whiff of a gentle sweet smell and hear the simple quiet buzz of the girls at work -- as a couple of crabby ladies pop out and ping off my veil, informing me that I'm in their space. &nbsp;I tell myself \"it is ok, settle down, all is well\". &nbsp;After a few gentle puffs of cool smoke we all seem to calm down a bit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today, I'm checking in on a brand new queen that I grafted (created) just six weeks ago. &nbsp;Four weeks later, I noted eggs and larva in this hive, so I know the queen emerged and mated. &nbsp;Today's work is simple... find this queen and mark her -- always assuming that she is still alive today!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/25/beautyqueen07982.md.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"/>&nbsp;<em><strong>That's the queen -- dead-center</strong></em></p>\n<p>Now, the bee \"authorities\" all claim that you should gently hold the queen between thumb and finger and then very carefully place a small spot of paint on her thorax. &nbsp;Let it dry and then release her back into the colony. The color is specific to the last 2 digits of the year. &nbsp;Pretty simple! &nbsp;What the experts don't seem to mention is that you must search among 50,000 bees buzzing about -- grumpy and stressed in the late summer heat during the dearth of late nectar. &nbsp;Now that I have had the hive open for a few minutes, everything feels frantic. &nbsp;Sweat is dripping from every pore in my body while I search frame by frame looking for that one special bug. &nbsp;I find my mind racing. &nbsp;Where the heck is that she? &nbsp;As time passes, the open hive is defenseless to the other bees in the bee-yard and for miles around -- causing the girls to become more and more feisty and defensive as I become more impatient with the task at hand.</p>\n<p>\"Oh yippy skippy, I found her!\" &nbsp;This is so much better than finding Waldo (although I rock at that too). &nbsp;I move the frame she's crawling on into a special box to protect her (mostly from myself) for the moment. &nbsp;Put the hive back together and toss on a cover. &nbsp;That should keep the other bees from robbing the hive for a few moments. &nbsp;With the paint pen readied, it is time to take on the task of placing a dot on her back. &nbsp;I, once again, try to locate the queen. &nbsp;Darn this lady has speed - moving all over the frame and ducking through holes in the comb arriving on the opposite side. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://redbricktown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/608.png\"/></p>\n<p>I spend some time trying to corner and catch her but fail as she flies off the frame and runs (breaking my 100M dash pace) under the hive. &nbsp;The \"experts\" don't mention that the fat plump mated queen can still fly! &nbsp;Oh no, what have I done?! Tears well up. But realize my friends, this is no ordinary queen, she's one that I grafted from a colony with a queen who I had over-wintered not once but twice! She's the only queen to emerge and mate from the 36 cells I thought I successfully grafted back in late June (The other grafts were a complete fail after taking an unplanned dive off the deck -- but that too is another story. &nbsp;My Bad!)</p>\n<p>Now, sadly, I must admit that this is not the first time I have had a queen who had a story to tell . . . but I digress... I carefully drop the frame, sputter a few less than positive words to myself and without a thought lean the entire hive to one side in hopes of finding my Queen. Now I know what you\u2019re thinking -- \"BAD IDEA!\", \"DON'T DO THAT!\". &nbsp;&nbsp;Trust me, I thought that too, but I needed find that queen, as without her the colony would dwindle and die. &nbsp;I had no replacement, no plan B.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/25/DSCF0117bd6dd.jpg\" width=\"195\" height=\"187\"/></p>\n<p>Awesome sauce! I found her - a REAL RESCUE. &nbsp;Scooping her up in my gloved hand and leaning the hive back down into its normal position, I commenced my attempt to mark her with a \"small\" white dot ... well it turned out she got herself a big fat splotch! (Serves her right!) Then acting like nothing unusual ever happened (which in some ways is was no different than any other bee-yard adventure), I released her into the hive, replaced the missing frame and put the inner &amp; outer cover back in place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Feeling fairly good with the overall final outcome (queen still alive, MARKED and in the hive), I collected my beekeeping stuff and snuffed the smoker. &nbsp;Just another fun day of awesome skillfulness in the bee-yard.</p>\n<p>=========================================================================</p>\n<p>I love the Doolittle Method for grafting (combined with the use of a Cloake board)! &nbsp;Don't get faked out, it is not \"do little\" but a name for the method of grafting/\u201ccreating\u201d queens. &nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Choose carefully from a frame of eggs and larva, selecting the tiniest larva in hopes it is &lt; 24 hours old AND floating it in a pool of delicious royal jelly. &nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Once the grafts are selected and delicately scooped up (careful not to flip the larva and block the sphericals/\"breathing tubes\" -- drowning them in the process), place them in plastic queen cells on a grafting bar fitted into a frame. &nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Inserted the frame into a queen-less hive that has been outfitted and manipulated for several days with the use of a Cloake Board. &nbsp;</li>\n  <li>With the proper planning and manipulation, tens of thousands of nurse bees fill the top hive box and will feed the grafts royal jelly while draw out the new queen cells, and care for the developing queens over the following 11 days.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>http://www.ohiostatebeekeepers.org/wp-content/pdf/books/Queen_Manual.pdf</p>\n<p>http://www.thebeeyard.org/rearing-queens-via-the-cloake-board-method/</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/25/May201205567d61.md.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5c9236_c609e6e3b70444fd8b756f5880dfcffb~mv2_d_2941_2046_s_2.jpg?dn=Minnow+Strength+2.jpg\" width=\"2941\" height=\"2046\"/></p>\n<h1>Minnows UNITE!

Now we can stop with all the inefficient, fake hand pollinating. You can't beat mother nature when it comes to anything in nature!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;There is a saying about busy bees and let me tell you, these bees started faster than any other bees we have ever had. &nbsp;Usually, when we get a shipment of bees, we set the out in the Steemhouse, and I run thru the steps to get the hive ready. The last step is to open the little slider that allows the bees out of the hive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I usually sit and watch for any bee movement, and in about four or five minutes they will start to emerge. This time, I walked away for less than a minute and bees were lined up to get out of the hive, granted we often get bees during the colder months so that may slow them down a bit.&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/8303ba16d.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"448\"/></center>\n<p>&nbsp;Let's just hope they keep up the enthusiasm and start some round the clock pollination!</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/830297c53.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"448\"/></center>\n<p>&nbsp;This is the box that holds the hive inside, these bees do not make honey, but they earn their keep just the same. &nbsp;The hole that you see right in the center of the lid is the entrance and exit holes, the plastic slider moves up and you can set it to where the bees can move in and out freely or just enter the hive and stay there. This comes in handy if you ever want to relocate the hive. If you were to move the hive while the bees are out, they would be lost. You would have a large swarm of bees hovering where the hive used to be. They have a great memory as far as the location of the hive, but no problem-solving skills to find the new location.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I shot some video of me setting up the hive and it is awful, it's hard to shoot and work the box with only one hand, so please forgive me for the crap quality, but I think it covers most of it.</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/dSXaLNzWJmM</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And as I said earlier, a little video of the bees ready to get out and work! Hope you enjoy them!</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/W-_rAde9hGw</p>\n<center><h1>In Other News</h1></center>\n<p>&nbsp;Quick update on the tomatoes, last week I showed you a few new baby tomatoes. this week they have grown a little bit, getting close to golf ball size. So now with the bees in, we should see new tomatoes start to pack on the vines. Hold on tight folks, the fun is just starting!</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/830c40bb.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"448\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/830188220.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"448\"/></center>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sorry for the lack of updates, but things are really moving right now, I'll try to get more updates in as we go.</p>\n<p>Thanks for stopping by and hope you come back!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

(membrane winged insects) Do you know what being a social insect means? They are insects which live in large groups. These are called colonies and a single honey bee colony can have as many as 60,000 bees in it. With so many bees in each colony, it is important that different jobs are given to different bees, and that each bee knows what it should be doing.\nOrganization is Important for Bees\n\nOrganization is important because the success of the colony is dependent on how well the bees work their jobs. Team work among the colony is vital for the hive to function well. And so for the good of the hive, the entire colony must work as a team.  In case you don\u2019t exactly know, a hive is the bee\u2019s home or nest, where eggs are laid and the bees store their ready made honey. Inside the hive, there are three types of bees: the queen, workers, and drones. Each bee has its own purpose within this hive.\n\nhttps://savetheearth.coop/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/05b9387d-ec48-42d4-bc69-1b4e4f8b8df5-4.png\n\nThe Queen of The Hive\nThere is only one queen within a typical hive and \u2013 interesting fact \u2013 the male drones actually  do not have stingers. The queen, as well as worker bees, have stings at the end of their abdomens, which they use in emergencies to defend their territory should the hive be attacked. The queen is the largest bee in the hive, with a longer abdomen, a non hairy shiny thorax (middle section). She maintains the colony\u2019s numbers by laying as many eggs as she possibly can, laying up to 2,000 eggs a day.\n\nWorker Bees\nThe worker bees outnumber the other bees in the hive, although they are the smallest members of the beehive. Did you know that, in fact, all worker bees are female? And as I previously mentioned, worker bees have stingers; however, they can only sting once and then they die because when they sting, parts of their internal organs are pulled out with the sting. Ouch.\n\nWhy are Honey Bees So Important\nHoney bees are very important. Why is this? They are the strongest link in the chain between the people who grow the food and the people who eat the food. Without bee pollination, the food we eat could decrease by up to a 3rd. Many fruits such as oranges, apples, peaches, pears, strawberries, cherries, vegetables, nuts and seeds are all pollinated by worker bees. As well as pollinating many crops, honey produced by honey bees is a very important source of energy especially in poorer nations.\n\nHow Can we Help Honey Bees? \nHumans have been harvesting honey for at least 6000 years, possibly longer. At this present time bees are suffering from many conditions which have plummeted their numbers to drastic levels and many hives have mysteriously disappeared. The causes aren\u2019t fully understood, but are usually blamed on the rising use of pesticides, and many diseases which colonies tend to suffer from like the deadly cripaviridae, and chronic bee paralysis virus. Everything in our absolute capability must be done to find the causes. We we must protect bee colonies.\n\nWe must also encourage wild bees by planting flowers, particularly flowers they like, which will help encourage their numbers. It\u2019s quite simple. Without bees, we will not be able to eat the necessary fruits and vegetable we need in our diets. No bees, no ecosystem. If the bees go, they will take us with them.\n\nhttps://savetheearth.coop/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/seeds-300x225.jpg?42a6f2\n\nJoin us here and be part of a movement to make change http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/save-the-earth-the-peoples-cooperative",

    "body": "<center>http://myerstownfamilyfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20130506_181600_467.jpg</center>\nImagine the tickle of the little legs going about all up and down your body and then... No not that kind of al natural! \n\nYou've heard about the plight of the beekeeping community. You've heard about the dying bees and how \"scientists\" are baffled by the strange die offs and disappearances. Well friends, I have kept bees for over 10 years and the only die offs I had were those that came as a mistake of my own. Those who feel they know whats going on only know the half of it (myself included). \n\nThe subject of beekeeping is a hot topic so I am sure I'll have plenty of folks who want to chime in. Feel free. After all, they are the biggest pollinator for the hosts of crops that are produced in all over the world. Given the relatively new problem facing beekeeping these days, I thought I might interject a few of my own practices. \n\n<center>http://myerstownfamilyfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20140511_092927_996-1.jpg</center>\nIn full disclosure, I've been out of the beekeeping business for 2 years due to a move to Alaska and now a move back to Missouri.  Although, plans are set to restore the Apiary I once had. \n\nWhen I meet folks who like the concept of beekeeping but are an older generation who have not been listening much to the beekeeping world, the first thing they always ask is: How are the bees doing with the Mites? Truth is, Mites have not been an issue for a long time. The bees have learned to adapt. The beekeepers have adapted their methods to make mites (veroa) a non issue.  \n\nWhat is my own method of managing this pesky little problem is simple?\n\nhttp://myerstownfamilyfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dsc01758smaller.jpg \nI have a flour sifter that I fill with powdered sugar. I select a time in the spring and in the fall and I take the boxes loose and sift powdered sugar over the frames of each of the boxes. Boom Done. How does this work? When you coat all of the bees in the sweet white powder, you not only end up with little white ghosts flying around, but you also give the bees a sweet incentive to clean each other off. In the process, they also find the mites and remove them from their sisters and they fall down onto the bottom board where, if you have installed a screened bottom board, they fall through and are out of the hive.  This has been a very successful method for me. \n\n<center>http://myerstownfamilyfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20150515_162746small.jpg</center> \nA secondary method is to NOT requeen every year or so.  Many beekeepers requeen in order to keep the brood capacity high and to manage the breed type. I dont care about breeds, I only care that my bees are healthy and productive. By not requeening each time, this gives the natural processes of the hive the ability to adapt to whatever diseases may be present. \n\nThe hive has a normal process of supersedure  that is a process by which the workers are alerted to the waning pheromone of the queen and the select a couple young eggs that she has laid and they place it in a \"queen cell\" to which they feed the larva a full diet of royal jelly. This higher potency diet gives the larva the nutrients necessary to develop the reproductive organs fully and become a queen. The new queen emerge out of the cell and escape out the hive to which drones sensing her pheromone excite and attempt to bread with her.  After this period, she has all of the sperm she'll ever need to fertilize the eggs for the rest of her life. She goes back into the hive from which she was born and kills the old queen and becomes the new queen. \n\n<center>http://myerstownfamilyfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20150411_170230small.jpg</center>\nBy allowing this natural process to occur, one allows the successful genetic traits to continue on to the next generation which in turn, effects your other hives in the apiary. The problem of today's beekeeping methods are compounded by the artificial management of hives. Beekeepers move hives around to various fields to take advantage of the different pollination periods, they requeen with queens from a different \"Breeder\", and they use toxic chemicals on the bees to control every malady that is known instead of allowing nature to take its course and fix the problem. \n\nNatural beekeeping does take some nerve. Watching a hive die is not fun. I admit to attempting to save a hive by adding a frame of young brood from a good productive hive in hopes that the genetic traits in the eggs will be spread to the rest of the hive through Supersedure. \n\n<p>Please be sure to check out our website at <a href=\"http://www.myerstownfamilyfarm.com\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>MyerstownFamilyFarm.com</strong></a> (currently under construction) and visit our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/myerstownfarm/\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Facebook Page</strong></a> for more updates.</p>",

A lot of these dreams revolve around simple things such as fame and riches. And while supporting a variance of individualistic manifestations covering a broad range of applications the construct of the subconscious hive mind is still by and large the same throughout. The desire for prominence and wealth is preeminent and promulgated by the inherent herd mentality of the subconscious hive mind construct.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p534/merkabah47/hive%20mind%202.jpg\" width=\"762\" height=\"227\"/></p>\n<p>Granted, the appeal of these things is obvious, especially when dealing with hive mind and herd mentalities. Fame is synonymous with recognition and the more recognizable you are to more people the more influence you have over the collective subconscious. However, it should be noted that this influence can work for or against the wielder of fame. Fortune and wealth grants similar (albeit more subtle and powerful) influence and control over the minds of the masses. So what really does the individual and collective mind alike yearn for if the two most prominent dreams and desires essentially reduce down to having more power? Well, that's the answer. The mind (both collective and individual) craves power at its core.</p>\n<h2>Going Where Others Fear To Tread</h2>\n<p>We live in an age of interconnectedness and continuously emerging disruptive technologies. We've come a long way from following herds on the open plains. Or have we? In this digital age are not content creators such as myself essentially tracking the patterns and movements of the herd in order to best benefit from the resources that the herd provides? How am I any different from my often so call primitive ancestors? If anything, I'm worse off. Whereas my ancestors only needed to pick off a couple stragglers here and there to provide for themselves I am playing a different numbers game where I am attempting to get as many of the herd as possible. I've evolved from hunter gatherer to wild west rustler and rancher.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p534/merkabah47/5a3ecc87-28b4-4af9-ae6b-7e22e44b0485.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"319\"/></p>\n<p>So what does it really mean to tread where others fear? I'm certainly not treading anywhere that others aren't willing to tread by posting here on Steemit. I'm just like thousands, if not millions, of others all vying for the same attention from the same pool of people. The level of uncertainty when concerning success certainly isn't any greater or much less than what was experienced by our hunter gatherer progenitors. So again, where's the dream? If you'll bear with me I'm laying the ground work as fast as I can to drive home the point I'm hoping to get across.</p>\n<h2>Running the Risk of Alienation</h2>\n<p>What it comes down to in this day and age (and even in past ages) is the risk of alienation. In order to successfully branch out into new territory you must run the risk of alienating the rest of the herd. This however is self-defeating if your livelihood effectively depends on your overall level of acceptance with the hive mind. Is there anyway to alienate yourself and at the same time draw in a mass core of followers? This formula tends to only work well with shock rockers and not so well for the blogging crowd.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p534/merkabah47/Marilyn_Manson_f9214071.jpg?t=1472662470\" width=\"359\" height=\"240\"/></p>\n<p>History has taught us that to challenge the zeitgeist is to often resign oneself to complete and total rejection. Sometimes this is as passive as ridicule and shame (which in some societies can prove to be harmful if not in some extreme cases fatal) and others it goes as far as imprisonment or death. And yet many of the greatest innovations that we today tend to take for granted come from those who were overtly ostracized and even persecuted for the challenging new ideas that they brought forth. Is this to mean that we are to forever remain subservient to the whims of the crowd? Must we really pander to the lowest common denominator?</p>\n<h2>Creating a Mutually Beneficial Relationship</h2>\n<p>I do not believe that we are forever doomed to feed into the consumer mentality in order to sustain ourselves through group economics. Platforms like Steemit more than support this belief. It allows me the freedom and comfort to produce content that while disruptive in nature is inviting and insightful. Never before has a platform appealed to me the way that Steemit does. And it goes beyond the obvious mass appeal of being paid for creating and upvoting content. I truly feel invited to share my thoughts on this platform.</p>\n<p>Fortunately enough for me Steemit has already created a mutually beneficial relationship whereby I can bypass the essential disruptive and alienating nature that I have found my thoughts and content often displays. I know there are plenty of people out there who would vibe with my prose and my mode of thinking but the challenge is that people who think like me are often so preoccupied with our own thoughts that we have little to no incentive to build a reliable community.</p>\n<p>I would call this something of a lone wolf complex wherein we who are inherently and instinctively predisposed to challenge the status quo often do so to our own isolation and detriment. We would be stronger together and yet we cannot overcome our cynicism and our own apathetic lethargy to form a cohesive bond by which to overthrow the power systems which threaten to drive the herd off a cliff.</p>\n<h2>A Hive Mind of Free Thinking Rebels</h2>\n<p>Yet I dare to dream of a coalition of free thinking rebels and lone wolves who are able to for a time work together a common and mutually beneficial goal. But finally I know I am not alone in this dream and there is light in the darkness and the dream is looking to become a reality for the first time in my life. Yes, my dream much like Steemit is still in its infancy but as I have chosen this as the platform for my dream I am wholly committed to nurturing both this dream and this groundbreaking platform.</p>\n<p>As I have no following established on any other social media platform for the aforementioned reasons I am attempting to create from the ground up my entire following here on Steemit. I simply don't feel comfortable on any other platform and that's the honest truth of it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@ethosfetchmania\">Ethos Fetch Mania</a></p>\n</html>",

To do at home frame for beehives, you will need a bit of dry strips (it is better to use lime, pine and other hardwoods), thin wire and Shoe nails. From tools, use the common pliers, an awl and a hammer. tool for making remolds that would have an idea on how to make frames for the bees, you need to understand what forms are used and main dimensions. It is the shape and size of the frame affect the activity of the bee colony, and the space between them, the width of streets and the installation of the framework contribute to the productivity of bees, their intensity.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>http://i.imgur.com/62Bl7dD.png</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>The size of frames for the #hive</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>The size of frames for the hive to determine the productivity of the entire apiary, serviceability bees, therefore, specially developed standards, which should adhere to when making the design. The idea of unification of fundamental sizes of hives, caused by the invention of the hive. The basics of beekeeping to date give a clear idea about the courses of the optimal size.</strong></p>\n<p>http://i.imgur.com/1gQYNk1.jpg<br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>The famous Russian theorist and practitioner P.

No less popular is the frame Langstroth-Ruta, which is slightly smaller in width 435 x 230 mm. Store frame has dimensions of 435 x 145 mm. At present enjoys great popularity, the invention of domestic beekeepers, the so-called Ukrainian frame, dimensions 300 x 435 mm .</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Used today in the bee fisheries framework for hives differ not only in their size, but also different ways of fastening, fixing honeycombs.

The loss of bee hives costs beekeepers an estimated $2 billion in the United States while bees are responsible for pollinating $200 billion dollars\u2019 worth of food products. Bees are also responsible for pollinating over 70% of the food we find in supermarkets. Foods such as: nuts, fruits and vegetables are dependent on the pollination of the honey bee. The meat industry would also be affected as the feed given to livestock relies bees too. \nOur existence depends on the honey bee. Without the pollination of plants and trees from honey bees our food choice would be severely limited. While there are a few reasons as to why the honey bee is in decline, many sources blame climate change, this article will identify some of the main causes for why the honey bee is declining and what can be done about it. \n\nPesticides\nMuch of the declining numbers of bees and other wild pollinators is occurring in north western Europe and North America. This is due to pesticides. In fact, the use of pesticides plays the largest role in the decline of bee population. Studies from Harvard University showed that when bees were exposed to two neonicotinoids it would lead to half of the bee hives being studied dying. The control group in the experiment which was not exposed to neonicotinoids remained healthy with none of the hives dying off. Neonicotinoids are the most widely used class of insecticides making their use even more devastating to bee populations.  \nBy buying organic produce you can, not only eliminate reduce the amount of insecticides and pesticides you ingest through the food you eat but you will also be encouraging farmers to stop treating their crops with insecticides. \n\nVarroa mite \nThe varroa mite is a small red mite which attaches itself to honey bees. It sucks their blood and it some cases it can spread a disease called varroosis. This mite can only reproduce in honey bee colonies. A significant varroa mite infestation will  lead to the death of the entire bee colony. This pest has been attributed to colony collapse disorder in bees. \n\nPlant diversity\nMost of the honey that you will find in your super market is produced by beekeepers with a large number of hives. These beekeepers will work with farmers and people who work in the field of agriculture. Plants which have been pollinated by bees produce a larger yield when they have been pollinated therefore food producers are only too happy to have bee hives on their land. However, the farmers tend to specialise and produce few kinds of foods. A farmer may only grow strawberries or he may only produce almonds. As a result, the bees who are pollinating the farmer\u2019s land are restricted to one main source of nectar an pollen. Bees do not fly further than a range of 3km from their hive. On a large farm they are almost forced to pollinate one type of plant. \nThis means that they do not get much diversity of pollen and nectar in their hive. This is comparable to humans only eating one kind of food. We need a varied diet to be healthy. The same goes for bees. Farmers and beekeepers in Europe have had success in reducing the number hive losses by have a piece of land on the farm which is dedicated to wild flower and giving the bees an alternative source of nectar and pollen. \n\nWifi signals\nStudies have shown that phone signals can have an effect on bees. When mobile phones were placed in or near a bee hive and the phone received a call or made a call it resulted in the bees creating 10 times more noise than they normally would. This increase in noise is a signal used by the bees to communicate that they should leave the hive. When the bees created this noise as a result of the mobile phone signals and left the hive they would fly erratically as they were confused and disorientated.",

There\u2019re well-furnished hotels for pets everywhere. They started to appear in a great amount the last few years. People reasoned that bees aren\u2019t worse.

You can see the pictures of some leaf cutter bees hives calls \u00abwooden bees\u2019 hotels\u00bb below.\nOf course, the bees\u2019 hotel can\u2019t even compare with a real hotel for people. It\u2019s not that important for bees if the conditions are comfortable or not. The most important in this \u00abbuilding\u00bb for bees are holes where they can put off the larvae. \nFor \u00abhotel\u00bb like that is very good, more precisely, perfect to have complete \u00abnumbers\u00bb. For bees that\u2019s not important from what material they are done. The most important when you choose the material is to choose something that won\u2019t be harmful for bees. The most common materials are hollow bamboo or wooden sticks. \n\nHow to build the hotel for bees?\n===\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fKH1c1N.jpg)\n<a href=http://varlamov.me/img/--/DSC09355.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\n1.\tThe most important is to prepare a rectangular frame; it\u2019s a foundation for future hotel. To do this, connect four wooden planks. The optimal deep of a frame is approximately 10 cm. \n2.\tThen you should choose the hollow rods. It\u2019s desirable to find materials of different diameter from 2 and even to 10 mm. It\u2019s important to keep track of the rods because the walls inside tubes must be smooth not to harm the insects. \n3.\tSticks are trimming for deep of frame. After that, you should just carefully fill by them all free space. \n4.\tAfter all of that, you should choose the place for your hotel for bees. The sunlight should light the constriction the most part of the day. Moreover, it must be the direct sunlight. You also should ensure that the hotel for bees won\u2019t become wet in the rainy days because if it is like that, all the bees will leave the hotel very soon. You should hang or place your hotel on a one meter height. What\u2019s more, that\u2019s a minimum. Don\u2019t forget to get rid of excess vegetation which can block the access to insects in their home. \n\n\nFor what kind of bees these hotels are attractive and why?\n===\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BAh0jtF.jpg)\n<a href=http://mir-pchelovoda.ru/www/www/mir-pchelovoda/images/11-193.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\nThe number of bees is reduced sharply in recent years. Pesticides destroy a huge number of these beneficial insects. Moreover, not just pesticides do this dirty work. \nThe hotels like that attract the bees on the areas. However, the most of the bees who aspire into these hotels are lonely bees, the bees who doesn\u2019t have their own family. They can\u2019t just come to a big unknown family and ask to take them into their hive. It\u2019s like in the cities or even towns: people can\u2019t come to unknown family or even to rivals for a very long time and ask to take them forever. They try to find an apartment or a room where everyone is like them: without a big \u00abfamily\u00bb and trying to make his own one. Bees are social insects, they can\u2019t live in the whole loneliness, so it\u2019s not a good way for them to fins an apartment. They will just die in the loneliness. They should have their hive, their family. In this way, many lonely bees are going to the hotels like that to make their own new family.  \n\nWhat\u2019s the benefits of these bees\u2019 hotels?\n===\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vPn6u4n.jpg)\n<a href=http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6602/11206178.166/0_b9e3d_e18b1d7_orig>Image Source</a>\n\nBy building leaf cutter bees or bees\u2019 hotels, how they are called, you kill two birds with one stone. Firstly, it\u2019s a benefit for you and, secondly, you help our ecology a little bit. As it was told above, the number of bees is reduced sharply in recent years because many other creatures kill bees. Moreover, people often watered their fields with chemicals which are deadly not just for insects which people want to kill but for bees too. \nIt\u2019s a real ecological help because after any kind of catastrophe, for example, there are lonely bees who try to find a family. They are going to these hotels. It\u2019s a real help for insects if the hotel is built in the right way. \nAdding to that, it\u2019s a great benefit for you. Bees are very useful insects. Firstly, they make really great and healthy honey. Moreover, bees are useful not just because of their honey. Anyway, having a bees\u2019 hotel on your green area is a great benefit. \n\n### <p><em>Thank you for your attention!</em></p>\n### <p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kental\"><em>@kental</em></a> <em>with you!</em></p>\n### <p><em>Let's learn beekeeping together!</em></p>\n### <p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kental\"><em>Follow me</em></a> <em>If you want to learn more about beekeeping!</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n----\nP.S.

Look it!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>http://econet.ru/media/155/kindeditor/image/201303/20130311191615.jpg</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Quality of the comb is greatly enhanced when a frame with honeycombs put between the honeycombs with open brood. Honeycomb build good quality cuttings with young Queens. After the bees of the nucleus will pull the cell across the square honeycomb, these palustrine frame transmit strong families for completion and mastery, and cuttings put in a new one with the honeycombs.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>http://media.dietolog.org/img/food/1/13807-0.jpg</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The liquid part of the honey bees usually suck, and the crystals thrown on the floor or carried out of the hive. To get the bees to use crystallized honey, it should spray into the cells with it warm water, repeating this until the full use of the crystals.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>http://receptymeda.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/45545556.jpg</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Eating a mixture of pollen of different species of plants, bees are grown more brood than the feeding on the pollen of the same species. This may explain the eagerness of the bees to have a hive with a mixture of pollen of different plants.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Pleuromutilin should be included only at the time of the spring season, when the bees in large numbers bring pylorus plants. Experiments showed that using pollen traps is only 40 bring pollen. When pollen prinos her #bees increases. With the onset of a significant bribe pleuromutilin should be switched off. Four-year experiments of the Institute of apiculture has shown that family can get 2-3 kg of dried pollen without prejudice to brood growth and the allocation of wax.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>For delivery of water to the hive bees spend a lot of energy and time. To bring a liter of water, they need to make at least 17,000 flights. Therefore in the spring it is necessary to supply the bees clean warm water. It will protect from destruction and premature wear many bees. Water (0.5 l) can be given in the cells of one of the outer combs to pour a thin stream to penetrate into cells. Early spring in the water you can add 0,8 salt. Bees willingly take it and use it for honey liquefaction and other needs.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>http://izhevsk.ru/forums/icons/forum_pictures/006034/6034525.jpg</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Print #honey comb is quite labor \u2014 intensive operation, time consuming, and together with signet removes a portion of the honey, reduced the volume disturbed the surface of the comb. Use the dryer to dry your hair or air heater having a spiral and a fan, these disadvantages are eliminated. A jet of warm air directed onto the surface of a honeycomb. The wax caps are melted and fold. Because the frame is filled with honey, which has a large heat capacity, the walls of the cells do not have time to warm up and are not damaged. Treating with dryer both sides, honeycomb is placed in a honey extractor. After extraction of honey frames can be put in the form of pale malt or return to the hive; preferably at the same place as the configuration of the honeycomb is preserved.&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>http://www.membrana.ru/storage/img/3/3p1.jpg</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Bees are not only capable of high stability to adjust the temperature of the nest, but also to aerate it. To do this, they flap their wings. The frequency of strokes and the number of individuals participating, increases with increasing concentration of carbon dioxide. In the same way the bees react to the overheating of the nest. In hot weather, when delivered in the beehive of a large amount of nectar during the hours bees ventilators provide a more than hundred-fold air exchange. To reduce energy costs to the bees on the job, you should open ledovye vents and ventilation Windows of the hives.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Thank you for your attention!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@kental was with you!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kental\"><strong>Follow me!!!</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>My last article about </strong><a href=\"https://steemit.com/bees/@kental/landing-a-swarm-to-the-hive-beekeeper-new-hive-with-the-bees-what-is-a-swarm-of-bees\"><strong>Landing a swarm to the hive</strong></a></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "Every song tells a story to me. Fascinating visuals broadcast through my mind like an IMAX presentation when I close my eyes and put my headphones on. I'd like to give you a glimpse into what I see, so feel free to listen along as I present the stories I've found while listening to some of my favorite tracks.  \n\nToday's track:  *Strife II - How Do I (Maduk Remix)*\n\n# 002 - Welcome to the Steemit Hivemind\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1s0bW3GIlY\n\nA kaleidoscope of color washed over my mind as I was integrated into the Steemit hivemind.  As reality stabilized around me, I found myself welcomed by a dozen friendly faces, all eager to greet me, like I was a long-lost friend returning after being separated for decades.  The spatial reality construct before me was clean and futuristic, with just a hint of the stylistic embellishments that I recognized from my childhood, before the hives appeared.  I was lost in the amount of dancing, cheering, and smiling I saw in the crowd.  Everywhere I saw people sculpting, writing, and showing their real faces.  No one was using a holo-avatar saved from their best smile of the week.  Everyone here looked very natural, which in itself was unusual.\n\nI was no stranger to being in a hive mind, a collective group of thousands or millions of minds all plugged in to the same digital reality.  After the first couple of times it becomes just like any other adventure, and one is free to traverse between them given enough time and social status.  Generally, those who couldn't pay could donate a portion of their own brain's processing power to keep the simulation going, and many did.  In the last few years though, questions began to swirl through the dominant hives as to just how much brainpower they were taking from those in the simulation, and many saw diminishing returns on their investments, which started to shake the foundations of the larger hives.  People were getting tired of being absorbed in a reality that promised the world but delivered nothing.  The masses grew tired and restless, searching for validation of their own personal realities amidst the crowds of fake personalities and the bland landscapes delivered by the hive's steady distancing from stable and creative realities to more advertisment-heavy cityscapes made of copy-and-pasted code stripped from the stretches of the net, code we'd all seen before and were unimpressed by.\n\nI wasn't the first of my group to leave, but I was already growing tired of my  current hive, casually spending more time away from it than plugged in, when a good friend of mine, a trusted photographer and uniquely creative individual started ranting and raving about a hive that would pay you not just for your processing power, but just for showing your personality.  They'd pay you for watching others and being the first to identify a particularly nice holo-field, artistic ability, or just a caring stranger willing to help those in need.  Not only that, but they'd pay the creator of said art, inspiration, or story, all for just being a part of it, and helping it grow into something beautiful.\n\nNaturally I questioned him, aware of promising schemes where guarantees of plugging in would net you great rewards, just to have your mind slagged and your bank account ruined.  I didn't particularly like the feeling of having to pay off the debt of a neuro-wipe at the hospital, and it had been a while since I performed a backup anyway, being barely a middle-class citizen myself.  He swore up and down that he just made his first major deposit, that it wasn't fake, and continued with the semantics of the cube-chain and decentralized currencies.  The conversation blurred somewhat over the advertisements of a nearby coffee shop coming in over my sub-vocal receiver, but I got the gist of it.\n\nThat evening I took off from the office early, headed home, and sat down in my den.  I punched in the coordinates of the Steemit hive mind, and waited as the scanners in my room synchronized to my current frequency.  I knew I'd never be the same as soon as a kaleidoscope of color washed over my mind, and I finally felt at home.",

One of them is the honey bees. one out of three meals eaten through humans is made possible by honeybees. They're so important that if all the honey bees were to die out, lots of plant would follow, which could lead to millions of &nbsp;human beings starving in the following years. On top of that honey bees have a massive economic impact. The dollar value of plants pollinated by them each year is around 256 billion dollar. Food we take for granted could just stop existing without them, or there might be a huge decrease in productivity. Food including apples, onions, pumpkins and plant used for feeding farm animals and for that extremely important for our milk and meat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://i.imgur.com/QcrUANL.jpg</p>\n<p>( This picture is created with the help of an online tool)</p>\n<h3>Einstein is &nbsp;quoted as having said&nbsp;</h3>\n<blockquote>\"if honey bees die out, humans will follow a few years later.\"&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p>Without a doubt he possibly didn't say that, But there might be some truth within the statement. It is unsettling but honey bees have started to disappear.Millions of hives have died within the past few years. Beekeepers all over the world have seen an annual loss of 30-90% in their colonies. In the US &nbsp;bees are steadily declining. From 5 million hives in 1988 &gt; 2.5 million hives these days. Since 2006, a phenomenon called \"colony collapse disorder\" has affected honey bees in many countries. And we're not entirely sure what is causing it. All we know is that it is pretty serious.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://articles.extension.org/sites/default/files/pupavarroa.jpg</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://articles.extension.org/sites/default/files/pupavarroa.jpg\">source</a></p>\n<p>Over the last few decades bees have seen an invasion of very risky foes. Microscopic mites that infect the respiration tubes of bees. They lay their eggs and feed from the fluids of their victims, weakening them considerably and spending their whole life inside the bees. Or varroa destructor, a fitting name due to the fact they can only reproduce in honey bees hives and are one of the bees biggest enemies. The female mite enters a honey bee brood cell and lays eggs on the Bee larva earlier than it is about to pupate and before than the hive bees cover the cell with a wax capping. The eggs hatch and the young mites and their mom feed on the growing bee in the protection of the capped cell. The Bee is no normally &nbsp;killed at this stage, just weekend, so it still has enough strength to chew its way through the Wax capping and release itself from the cell. As it does it releases the mite and her new offspring from the cell, and these are free to spread across the hive, beginning the process once more in a cycle of approximately 10 days. Their numbers grow exponentially, and after a few months, this may cause the collapse of the whole beehive. Once outside of the cell, adult mites also suck the body fluids of bees and weaken them extensively. To make Things worse, they transmit viruses that harm the bees even more and can lead to birth defects like useless wings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/neonicotinoids-ban-665x385.jpg</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/neonicotinoids-ban-665x385.jpg\">source</a></p>\n<p>But,there are other threats too which include viruses and fungi. Beneath normal circumstances, those phenomena should be manageable and are now not enough to explain the horrendous amount of dying occurring in bees. Over recent years new insecticides have been introduced that are deadly to bees. Neonicotinoids a chemical family similar to nicotine, Was authorized in the early 1990s as an alternative to chemical compounds like DDT. They assault insects through harming their nervous systems. Today they're the most broadly used pesticides in the world. Globally, they saw sales of 1.5 billion euros in 2008, Representing 24% of the worldwide market for pesticides. In 2013, neonicotinoids is had been used in the u.s.on about 95% &nbsp;of corn and canola crops, and additionally on the vast majority of fruit and vegetables, like apples, cherries, peaches, oranges, berries, leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes, cereal grains, rice, nuts, grapes and plenty of mores.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QiS0_-ByVKA/VN6TrsTtg6I/AAAAAAAAAec/RjOWwJfnalc/s1600/Bee-drinking-water.jpg</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QiS0_-ByVKA/VN6TrsTtg6I/AAAAAAAAAec/RjOWwJfnalc/s1600/Bee-drinking-water.jpg\">source</a></p>\n<p>Bees come into touch with the toxin while collecting pollen or through infected water, often bringing material into the hive, wherein it can accumulate and slowly kill the whole colony. The toxins harm bees in a variety of terrible ways. In excessive sufficient doses, it quickly leads &nbsp;to convulsions, paralysis and death. But even in small doses it can be fatal. It may lead to bees forgetting how to navigate the world, so bees fly into the wild, wander off and die alone separated from their hives. If this occurs often enough, a hive can lose its capability to maintain itself. we know that neonicotinoids are harmful to bees and that we urgently want an alternative to it, But there are billions of dollars to be made in delaying this. Studies sponsored by the chemical industry magically appear to prove a much lower toxicity to bees, compared to the ones produced by way of independent scientists.</p>\n<p>http://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bee__says_help1.jpg</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bee__says_help1.jpg\">source</a></p>\n<p>There are even more factors contributing to the dying of bees, like an excessive amount of genetic uniformity, Crop monocultures, Low nutrition due to overcrowding, stress due to human activities and other insecticides. Each of those factors on its own is a problem for bees, but together they probably account for colony collapse disease. With parasites upping their game in last years. The honeybees are now fighting for survival. it would be a catastrophe if they lost this fight. This is a conundrum we have to solve, if we want to continue living with a relative abundance and variety of food. Humanity is deeply interconnected with earth and the other existence life forms on it, even if we we pretend we are now not. We have to take care of our environment, if not to preserve the beauty of nature, Than at least to ensure our own survival.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Follow Me- @masonmiler</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Bees are some of humanity's most vital little creatures. Their work enables one third of our food supply world-wide. These fuzzy air-borne insects are currently experiencing a great tragedy, which has caused a great extinction or drop in a large number of their species. I found out that I'm allergic to them after stepping on one and being stung at an early age, yet they're another one of the creatures I'm largely fond of.</p>\n<h1><em><strong>For The Queen!</strong></em><br />\n</h1>\n<p>http://i.imgur.com/NcV9b4q.gif</p>\n<h2>They're organised into 3 classes</h2>\n<p><strong>Queen</strong> -\u00a0<br />\nThe queen is an adult, mated female and is the largest bee in the colony. She lays 2000 eggs a day - roughly 400,000 a year. She is born when conditions are favourable for swarming and<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarming_(honey_bee)\" rel=\"noopener\"> t</a>he old queen decides to lay an egg in a 'queen cup.' The workers then pack the egg cell with beeswax and leave the young queen larva to grow. When she's ready to come out, the new-born virgin queen simply chews her way out of the cell. By this time, the old queen has packed up and left to colonise another place with the prime swarm at her side. Born into a life of royalty, the new virgin queen grows up being specially fed by worker bees in order to make her sexually mature. Queen honey bees don't mate with <em>drones</em> from their home colony. There is normally only one adult, mated queen in a hive, in which case the bees will usually protect her with their lives. If the queen suddenly dies, the entire (up to 60,000-strong) worker population starts producing <em>drone</em> eggs. The <em>drones</em> then start consuming the hives resources without replenishing them and the colony soon begins to die from starvation.\u00a0<br />\nIn the case of a Brazilian bee called ' Schwarziana quadripunctata' though, a nest can have multiple queens or even dwarf queens, ready to replace a dominant queen in a case of sudden death. The workers bees of this colony can even force undeveloped dwarf queen larvae and queen larvae to be converted into worker bees, or be erased due to limits on their food supply.</p>\n<p><strong>Worker Bee</strong> -\u00a0<br />\nThe majority of a hives population are worker bees. They collect the pollen, make the nest and honey, and care for the young and the queen. They do almost all of the work really, but they do it with a dance. It's called the 'bee dance' or 'waggle dance' and they use it to communicate information regarding food and resources with each other. This dance style varies from species to species as well. Similar to how rockers might dance to heavy music (Head-bangin') in comparison to people dancing to hip-hip (... Swangin')<br />\nThey create honey by flying to different blossoms and collecting a sugary juice called nectar.<br />\nWhen they have a full load, they take it back to their nest. There they pass the nectar to other worker bees who chew it, until it gradually turns into honey. The bees then place it in their walls made of beeswax and fan the honey with their wings until it's dry. When it's ready, they plug the cell with a beeswax lid to store it and keep it clean. They'll use this honey as food and will distribute it throughout their colony.<br />\nAll Worker bees are female and are the smallest bees in a colony. Some will take up the job of laying eggs, but are only capable of producing unfertilized eggs, which turn into males, also known as 'drones' - a process of the haplodiploid sex-determination system.<br />\nAn exception to this rule - laying worker bees in some subspecies of honey bees may also produce diploid (and therefore female) fertile offspring in a process called thelytoky.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Warning</em>: Worker bees can sting you, but only once \u2013 They have a barbed sting in their tale which once lodged into your skin, doesn\u2019t retract. When this happens the sting and the poison gland breaks free, and the worker bee dies soon after, releasing an alarm pheromone which alerts other workers that a threat is nearby. Some people are particularly allergic to bees and medical treatment should be sorted, never the less. The poison can contain parasites and other nasty things. In other cases where the species doesn't have a sting, it uses its mandibles - the paired teeth that can be opened and closed to chew wood, manipulate wax, clean other bees and bite other workers or pests.<br />\nMost worker bees only live for a month due to the strenuous activities they undertake in order to keep the colony thriving. The wear and tear simply becomes too much.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Drone</strong> -\u00a0<br />\nLike the ant drones in my previous article, bee drones are the only male bees in the colony and are the product of an unfertilized egg. Unlike the female worker bee, drones don't have stingers and don't participate in nectar, pollen gathering or battle. The drones life purpose is to catch up with a fertile queen bee from another colony and mate. They're a bit bigger than worker bees and have eyes that are twice the size of those of worker bees and queens. Drones die off or are ejected from the hive by the worker bees in late autumn, and do not reappear in the bee hive until late spring. Such is life.</p>\n<p>http://www.coolkidfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bumble.bee_.jpg</p>\n<p><strong>Cool facts about bees</strong><br />\n<br />\n1) Bees have been around for millions of years!</p>\n<p>2) \u00a0Honey is the only food that includes all the necessities to sustain life, including enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and water; and it's the only food that contains &quot;pinocembrin&quot;, an antioxidant associated with improved brain functioning. There are rumours that a person can live off just honey.</p>\n<p>3) \u00a0A honey bee can fly at about 15 miles per hour, and can do this for 6 miles.</p>\n<p>4) \u00a0The average worker bee produces about 1/12th a teaspoon of honey in her lifetime.</p>\n<p>5) \u00a0A hive of bees will fly 90,000 miles (the equivalent of three orbits around the earth) to collect nectar equivalent to 1 kilogram worth of honey.</p>\n<p>6) Bee's can recognise &amp; learn human faces! The image in <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/face-recognition-honeybees/\" rel=\"noopener\">THIS</a> article depicts what it would be like to see a person through the eyes of a bee.\u00a0</p>\n<p>7) They're dying off!</p>\n<p>That's right. Sad but true. If we didn't have bee's most of us would die.<br />\nThey need your help!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pesticide and the climate change has been a proven cause of their rapidly falling numbers. You can read more about that <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/live_animals/bees/health/index_en.htm\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>HERE</strong></a> (note: I'm not one to discuss whether climate change is natural or is caused by mankind, but this is a current discussion and debate being held between people all over the world.)<br />\n</p>\n<p>Don't mess with bees or you might end up like this guy!<br />\nhttp://a.abcnews.com/images/International/AP_bee_record_01_jef_150526_12x5_1600.jpg<br />\n<br />\nI'm actually pretty amazed at how closely bees and ants resemble the complex structures of even our human civilisations. When I think of queen bees laying 'royal' eggs, then '<em>getting the heck</em>' out of there, it reminds me of a human medieval power structure. Those in line to the throne might have personal reasoning to assassinate any standing in their way to it, including the king or queen themselves for example. As I said, a bee colony can only have one mated queen, and so this issue is sorted out through a fight to the death involving the two queens and the workers bees. In most disputes and battles in amongst themselves and with other colonies, drones (the male bees) sit on their arses and eat honey, as shown belown.\u00a0</p>\n<p>http://www.richmondhoneybee.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/drone.jpg<br />\n<br />\nBees come in many different shapes and sizes, but generally have the same structure. Their colour varies widely between species and showcases some very fascinating patterns.<br />\n</p>\n<p><strong>Pic's of the day</strong><br />\n</p>\n<p>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Bees_Collecting_Pollen_2004-08-14.jpg</p>\n<p>A honey bee working the fields, collecting pollen.</p>\n<p>http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-01-05-1451958281-3718611-i305c496a582a75bfe431df6b50622a4aBee_polinator_Osmia_ribifloris.jpg</p>\n<p>A blue wild bee\u00a0</p>\n<p>http://www.wildflowermix.com/images/larger-image/green-sweat-bee.jpg</p>\n<p>\u00a0A 'Green Sweat Bee' on a yellow flower.</p>\n<p>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/9e/6e/3c9e6e282e7e936abb78e7c4cacd5ec4.jpg</p>\n<p>Three solitary male bee's taking a nap on a branch.</p>\n<p>http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2013/02/Bumblebee-660x440.jpg</p>\n<p>A bumble bee, covered in the treasures of her work.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<em><strong>Thanks for Reading :) Hope you liked the article.</strong></em></p>\n<p><br />\n<br />\n</p>",

    "body": "http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t5/tabalitigi/bluepill.jpg\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to deciphering the origin of civilization, or the \"origins of consciousness\", we still only have conjecture and trivial theories because of lack of resources via various causes: i.e. oral history traditions, book burning, natural disasters, etc...\n\nOn top of the historical disconnect, we also have ancient cultures capable of building structures that could last for multiple epochs, while with modern technology we can't build structures that last for a 100 years. These engineers, while capable of scientific/technological feats that we cannot match today also seemed to believe in some stupid/crazy/fantastical nonsense that either we have completely taken out of context, misinterpreted, COULD have possibly existed in some form, it could have been done to mislead the uneducated, propaganda, OR they could have just actually been crazy...\n\nI have a very difficult time believing that the people that created geometry, chemistry, and mastered engineering believed that some \"magic dude in the sky\" used his magic powers to \"turn planets\", or \"create stars\", as they seemed very intent on understanding anything they possibly could, so to attribute some things to \"gods\" because they \"couldn't explain them\", when the gods seemed to have VERY specific directions or clear interactions when it happened, it's not a consistent argument. Especially when you have things like the identification of Sirius B thousands of years before telescopes capable of seeing it would have been invented.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogon_people\nhttp://arcturi.com/AncientAliens/DogonPeopleAndAliens.html\n\nWhile I don't ascribe to the ancient alien theory, there might be a biological explanation as to why people used to believe in \"supernatural/superhuman\" beings.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_hives\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_Hive\n\nhttp://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t5/tabalitigi/neo2.jpg\n\nIn the natural world, we have bee hives, ant colonies, and many other \"hive minded\" species. This entails a \"collective consciousness\" so to speak, and in turn, it would mean that there is likely little ego, or \"individuals\" within the colony. I believe that at some point, humans existed in a \"hive mind\" state, and the collective consciousness would have naturally preceded the formation of the \"individual\".\n\nWhat this would imply, is that during the evolution of humans, if at some point in time, we were all tapped into a \"collective consciousness\", there would be NO NEED for written language, no NEED for written history traditions, and NO NEED for an economic system, as the information and resources had not yet reached a point that exceeded the \"collective consciousness's\" capacity to either process information, or distribute available resources.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer\n\n\"The formative influence played by the Homeric epics in shaping Greek culture was widely recognized, and Homer was described as the teacher of Greece.[3] Homer's works, which are about fifty percent speeches, provided models in persuasive speaking and writing that were emulated throughout the ancient and medieval Greek worlds. Fragments of Homer account for nearly half of all identifiable Greek literary papyrus finds.[4]\"\n\nIf you are not familiar with \"Homer\" he is often misattributed as the \"writer\" of the Iliad and the Odyssey, when he was just supposedly the person who \"wrote them down\"...You have epics like the iliad and the odyssey being committed to memory by ONE person who is just ONE teacher amongst many scholars. I believe when you see THIS period of transition into \"writing\" things down, it's not because they reached the \"pinnacle\" of society necessarily, but they were breaking the processing limits of the collective consciousness, so it was necessary to begin using more methods of \"collecting information\" to record \"the important things\"...\nIf we use the \"computer\" as a metaphor for the collective consciousness since the computer was modeled after the brain, we can assume that the collective consciousness will hit a \"processing limit\". In computing, when we hit a processing limit, the solution is usually to take two equally fast processors, and divide the work load. This would be tantamount to a \"split\" in the collective consciousness: the formation of \"individuals\" able to process information outside of the \"processing limit\" of the \"collective consciousness\"...\n\nIt would be like an \"intranet\" vs. an \"Internet\"...\n\nthe collective conscious=Internet, and the individual = intranet...\n\nboth can be linked to each other, but the \"intranet\" has been \"disconnected\" from the \"Internet\" so it's functionally a \"private network\" at this point...\n\nNow, if this were the case, the \"hardware\" for the Internet, or collective consciousness would be \"vestigial brain tissue\" in SOME people but OTHER people might still be able to \"hack\" the Internet, and access the \"collective consciousness\", making them appear to have \"supernatural or godlike\" abilities. This is when you hear lore like that of \"alexander the great\" being able to stand on the shoulders of two of his men, and all three of them function as one warrior in battle...\n\nhttp://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t5/tabalitigi/smith2.jpg\n\nAlso, the idea of \"god kings\" or \"divine pharoahs\" where people completely devoted their lives and existence to one person, much like an ant colony or bee hive, and were able to accomplish things that a force under duress has NEVER been able to match. The reason I believe that there MIGHT have been some sort of different capacity of processing information is that you have these people who built the pyramids with VERY few people, VERY few resources, and didn't need to leave very much instruction on HOW to do it, for whatever reason.\n\nThey OBVIOUSLY weren't stupid, and although by this point they had definitely started keeping records, and were writing things down, they didn't much feel the need to record EVERY detail...I don't see these people being \"lazy\", or \"lax\" about their decision making, and on top of that, the idea that the \"information\" that this culture had amassed was SO dangerous that the religion that came to DOMINATE the world for the next 1200 years needed to completely wipe it off the face of the earth to rule the masses makes me think the christian church found something a long time ago that would explain why there are pyramids ALL over the planet, and whatever they found was something that allowed them to \"make everyone forget\"...\n\nI thought this might explain why we are moving TOWARDS a collective consciousness to a degree in the \"Internet\", as it's possible our neural network might be wired to \"be plugged in\"...\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_consciousness\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink\n\nhttp://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6138348999_f8bba5c918_m.jpg",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><strong>Bitcoin Primer </strong>(original material)</p>\n<p>The Bitcoin wiki is a great resource for anything from basic to highly technical questions. If you find yourself confused with a term in the guide or want more clarification start by checking here, as the accuracy is of a much higher standard than community resources like reddit, or Bitcointalk. There\u2019s a lot of noise out there, but the community has taken care to preserve the accuracy on this wiki.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction to Bitcoin</strong></p>\n<p>Bitcoin is an electronic peer-to-peer cash system. Electronic meaning it only exists on the internet, and peer-to-peer meaning you can send Bitcoins to anyone on the network with an address. There is no traditional oversight or censorship of transfers, so if you want to send $10,000 worth of Bitcoin to someone across the globe you can in a matter of minutes, with almost no fee. Like cash you can spend it anywhere it\u2019s accepted and it can not be censored. However, it shares another property of cash, it needs to be protected securely. Just like if someone gets your wallet from your back pocket if someone gets access to the keys to your Bitcoin, they can take the value. In the past years security has drastically improved, and service providers have taken advanced security measures with some holding insurance for the value of all the assets they hold. We\u2019ll make sure to only suggest products and companies we personally would trust with our Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin was invented by a pseudonym, or alias called Satoshi Nakamoto. It was likely a group of programmers, that collaborated and released the system anonymously. There have been many theories as to the identity and rationale of releasing the system anonymously. For instance, the creator(s) could have feared government censorship or simply did not want recognition and preferred to leave the upkeep of the network to the community. Whoever it was, the code base has significantly changed under the leadership of Gavin Andreesen who currently coordinates changes to Bitcoins code. Major changes are few and far between, giving Bitcoin amazing stability, and security, but there are consistently minor improvements and rewriting of code by collaborators.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does Bitcoin have value?</strong></p>\n<p>It comes down to what people describe as the network effect. Bitcoin is accepted at a large number of locations on and off-line, and has the most active users, and developers of any of the new payment systems. While you may hear the argument that Bitcoin has limitations which could keep it from maintaining dominance, keep in mind that new developments are planned that can extend Bitcoin to reach a broader audience. Rather than limitations Bitcoin has technical hurdles. Currently the core development is backed by MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the startup community has been growing more rapid than the beginning of the internet boom. These factors show long-term positive growth for the technology, and underlying value of the asset.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Trade Bitcoin?</strong></p>\n<p>Well by now you\u2019ve already at least committed the effort to get to know Bitcoin. We consider Bitcoin closest to an asset class, like Gold. There\u2019s a finite supply of 21 million total, and only so many can be produced daily. However, the market is volatile, and can shift quickly in either direction. We think that volatility is one of the great attributes for a Bitcoin trader. A knowledgeable trader, can make profit in a down or up market. While many large players have taken the stance of buying large chunks of Bitcoin and holding them, we see room for profit, regardless of the valuation of the asset. You can either trust the market to go where you want, hold and wait, or become more active and knowledgeable and grow your portfolio. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here to guide you along the path of growing your portfolio.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>To simplify what bitcoin is in a sentence. Bitcoin funds are under the complete control of the owner, and any amount can be sent at little or no cost to anyone on the network globally, and irreversibly, with minimal wait time as long as there is an internet connection.</p>\n<p><strong>Brief Technical Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Bitcoin is made up of a network of nodes and miners. Nodes are like servers, that connect together to broadcast when someone has sent Bitcoin. Miners are machines whose purpose is to compute a specific problem which secures the network. Keys are like a passphrase that unlock an address and it\u2019s funds. Some transactions may cost a small fee, which eventually goes to miners. The amount is minute, and many platforms cover them complimentary. Transactions are irreversible eliminating the need and possibility of individual oversight once funds are sent. The private key(s) of an address give full access to exchange value on the network, like a key to a safe. Once a transaction is broadcasted to the network, or sent to nodes, miners work to confirm the legitimacy of the transaction. Miners compete to find the solution to a complex problem, that comes from the SHA-256 algorithm. This algorithm, is a secure hashing algorithm, that can not be reverse engineered, and secures the value of each users funds. The miner that solves the problem is rewarded with Bitcoin. This process secures the network, by creating a decentralized network of computers which compete to earn a reward.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By finding the answer the transaction is proven valid and secure. This allows Bitcoin to operate freely without censorship or a central group which verifies transactions. Sometimes when depositing or sending Bitcoin you will have to wait for confirmations. Generally 3 confirmations, averaging about 10 minutes a piece, meaning miners have solved the problem and proven transactions valid are required to deposit funds. Transactions are actually sent near instantly and some services, like BitPay, do not wait for confirmations. Bitcoins are actually values in what\u2019s called the Blockchain. Instead of thinking of them as singular coins, or units, think of it as a database similar to what a bank has with it\u2019s accounting system. Your addresses are like the account numbers you have at a bank, and your specific balance is securely stored in the global network. This Blockchain database or ledger is distributed all across the network, and allows anyone to verify the amount of funds for a specific address. One simple way to do this is with a block explorer, like http://blockchain.info. Here you can specify an address or transaction number and see what took place on the network. The Blockchain itself does not store personal details about addresses, but when using exchanges or services to buy coins it\u2019s likely your transactions will be tracked on their platform separate from the Blockchain. We\u2019ll go into more depth about the technology in another guide but this is a quick recap of the technology.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a helpful visual explanation of how Bitcoin works:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc2en3nHxA4</p>\n<p><strong>Buying Coins</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing where to buy:</p>\n<p>First and foremost, you\u2019re looking for a trustworthy entity to purchase from. The bigger companies, like coinbase and circle are well known, and have great track records. The one drawback is the more established company you select likely the more information you will need to provide. Feel free to ask us any questions about companies, and you can generally contact their support at any time beforehand to clear up any confusion.</p>\n<p>coinbase - http://coinbase.com</p>\n<p>Is a U.S. based company, that has a great track record. Coins can be purchased via Bank Wire and if you link a credit card, funds can be deposited instantly.</p>\n<p>circle - http://circle.com</p>\n<p>Circle is a U.S. based company that allows purchase of Bitcoins with credit card and Bank Wire. It has a good track record, but has not been around as long as coinbase.</p>\n<p>localbitcoins.com - http://localbitcoins.com</p>\n<p>LocalBitcoins allows you to find vendors in your local area to purchase Bitcoin in person or other payment options. You should proceed with caution, as many scams have happened at the site, and when doing in person deals pick comfortable, public spaces like cafe\u2019s. It\u2019s best to check feedback for a user, and ensure those giving feedback are also trusted accounts.</p>\n<p>atm - http://coinatmradar.com</p>\n<p>You may find it convenient to buy coins from an ATM. You may still have to provide information, but the process is generally quick, and even large amounts can be handled.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a good resource for finding an ATM: http://coinatmradar.com/</p>\n<p><strong>On exchange</strong></p>\n<p>Most exchanges allow you to make a bank transfer to the exchange to purchase coins once you have submitted identity documentation.</p>\n<p>Other places to buy Bitcoin - http://howtobuybitcoins.info/</p>\n<p><strong>Exchanges</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing an exchange</p>\n<p>When choosing an exchange there are multiple important factors. One is trading instrument. Some offer leverage, lending and options style contracts and other have standard 1 to 1 or spot trading. Other factors include cost of fees, liquidity, security and quality of customer service. In our expert trading guides, we\u2019ll expand on these points but we\u2019ve highlighted key aspects in the exchange summaries below.</p>\n<p>bitfinex - http://bitfinex.com</p>\n<p>Bitfinex is a Hong Kong based exchange that caters to the english speaking world. It is the largest exchange used by United States customers. It offers spot trading, 3 to 1 leverage, and the ability to lend Bitcoins at interest. This is a good option if you have excess funds and want to earn small interest. Funds can be deposited via Bank Wire and identification only needs to be given for depositing or withdrawing funds. It also has pretty good liquidity. There are trading fees.</p>\n<p>coinbase - http://coinbase.com</p>\n<p>Is a U.S. based company, that has a great track record. Coins can be purchased via Bank Wire and if you link a credit card, funds can be deposited instantly. Coinbase has expanded to adding an exchange which currently only allows spot trading. Users are required to complete identification before using coinbase. There are trading fees.</p>\n<p>okcoin - http://okcoin.com</p>\n<p>okcoin.com is the international version of their chinese site. They offer spot trading, peer-to-peer lending, similar to the lending on Bitfinex, and futures trading. Futures are like options that expire after a set amount of time, one-week, two-weeks, or quarterly. Futures have to be traded at either ten and twenty times leverage. &nbsp;There are trading fees.</p>\n<p>okcoin.cn - http://okcoin.cn</p>\n<p>The chinese version of okcoin. &nbsp;It\u2019s one of if not the largest Bitcoin exchange meaning there is a lot of liquidity for traders. There is also zero fees permanently. Even if you don\u2019t plan to deposit or withdraw, Chinese Yuan, you may consider it as a platform for trade, because of the liquidity and zero fees, and withdraw your funds later for conversion back to desired currency..</p>\n<p>bitstamp - http://bitstamp.net</p>\n<p>Bitsamp used to be the leading Bitcoin exchange. They offer spot trade. They suffered a security breach, and lost a large amount of money, however all funds were covered and users did not suffer any loss. After that event, and temporary downtime users started switching platforms. Also their lack of alternate trading methods or lending makes it less desirable. There are trading fees.</p>\n<p>bitmex - http://bitmex.com</p>\n<p>Bitmex is a smaller exchange, but we mention it because it has what are called volatility contracts. You can trade against the volatility of Bitcoin not the specific price. There are trading fees.</p>\n<p>bitreserve &nbsp;- http://bitreserve.org</p>\n<p>Bitreserve is not exactly an exchange, but more a storage for funds. It allows instant conversion from Bitcoin, to gold, other assets and fiat currencies generally for zero fees. For those interested in hedging against gold, or converting funds back and forth and holding various currencies it\u2019s a great option. Here\u2019s a list of their current offerings: https://bitreserve.org/en/status</p>\n<p>kraken - http://kraken.com</p>\n<p>Offers trading between cryptocurrencies, FIAT and margin trading, after verification. It\u2019s a long-term established exchange, but has low liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Choosing a Wallet</strong></p>\n<p>There are many options for wallets. We\u2019ve taken the time to select what we consider the most functional and secure solutions. Each has a trade off, as their individual implementations have advantages and disadvantages. The main difference is in order to make a wallet convenient and easy to use, there is some exchange in security. In some cases that means trusting the company that hosts the wallet, in others it\u2019s more technical in nature. In any case, for funds you\u2019re not actively trading or loaning on an exchange, it\u2019s a good idea to find a convenient and secure way to manage and store funds.</p>\n<p>In this section the term multi-signature is used. This means instead of one key or password there are multiples. These can be distributed so that one key is held on the server of the company, and one key is controlled by you for instance. For more information on multi-signature visit: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended All around, iOS/Android/Desktop/Web wallets</strong></p>\n<p>While these are not our favorite wallets, what they do have in common is they work on all your devices. This is great if you commonly switch between devices, and want to always have access to funds. For larger amounts we recommends using secure multisig storage on Bitgo or Coinbase, or using a fully featured desktop wallet like Electrum or Armory, although Green Address and Hive do have some native multi-signature support.</p>\n<p>Green Address -https://greenaddress.it/en/</p>\n<p>GreenAddress is a multi-signature multiplatform wallet. It\u2019s easy to use but not as advanced or configurable as some of the wallets specific to one platform, like electrum, or Breadwallet.</p>\n<p>Hive Wallet - https://www.hivewallet.com/</p>\n<p>Hive is a fast multiplatform wallet. It has social components where you can easily send to other users on the platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Web Wallets</strong></p>\n<p>Bitgo - http://bitgo.com</p>\n<p>Bitgo is a highly customizable web wallet, with support for multi-signature and other security options. It\u2019s typically used as a secure service provider for exchanges and platforms, but can also be used by individual users.</p>\n<p>Circle - http://circle.com</p>\n<p>Circle is an easy to use web wallet, but doesn\u2019t provide additional security like coinbase vault.</p>\n<p>Coinbase - http://coinbase.com</p>\n<p>Coinbase has a web wallet, and also offers multi-signature secure storage in what they call the coinbase vault.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Desktop Wallets</strong></p>\n<p>Armory Wallet - https://bitcoinarmory.com/</p>\n<p>Armory is considered the most advanced full featured Bitcoin Wallet for Desktop. You will need to sync the Blockchain, but if you want the most extensive feature set and security Armory is a great option.</p>\n<p>Electrum Wallet - https://electrum.org/#home</p>\n<p>Electrum is a great desktop wallet, with many security features. It\u2019s an SPV client meaning it doesn\u2019t need to sync the blockchain and is ready to go right away. It encrypts keys and is an HD-Wallet, meaning Hierarchical Deterministic so with one passphrase and seed you can have many addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Mobile Wallets</strong></p>\n<p>These wallets are specifically focused on mobile devices. That means they offer better security, and more options over wallets that share multiple services like green address, and Hive.</p>\n<p><strong>iOS Only</strong></p>\n<p>breadwallet - http://breadwallet.com/</p>\n<p>Breadwallet is an easy to use, full Bitcoin client iOS wallet. You control fully your funds, and don\u2019t have to trust any third party to store credentials. It also utilizes the underlying security architecture of iOS.</p>\n<p><strong>Android Only</strong></p>\n<p>Mycelium - https://mycelium.com/bitcoinwallet</p>\n<p>Mycelium is an open-source android wallet, that is fast and has options for offline storage/management of keys. It\u2019s not a full client so waiting for the blockchain to synchronize is not necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></p>\n<p>Trezor - https://www.bitcointrezor.com/</p>\n<p>rezor is a hardware device similar to a USB stick, that allows you to store funds in an encrypted manner. This can be useful for securely storing funds offline.</p>\n<p><strong>Paper Wallets</strong></p>\n<p>Both Armory and electrum support mnemonic codes, essentially a set of regular words, that can be easily written down to recover a wallet. You could utilize encryption to store the phrases in an encrypted fashion even on paper. With these phrases you can recover every address in your electrum or armory desktop wallet, except those that were imported. The seed itself can recover all addresses, as both employ technology called HD, or Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets. To make the paper wallet more secure you can split it into parts, or use a BIP-38 encrypted key both of which are options in Armory and Electrum when generating. More information can be found here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet</p>\n<p><strong>Offline Wallets</strong></p>\n<p>A wallet address can be generated while not connected to the internet. For secure storage of large funds it may be a good idea to create addresses offline. This way the information about the address has never touched the internet, and you can be certain the only threat is physical access. Remember to securely delete the generated files, before connecting or use a fresh operating system, or live operating system.</p>\n<p><strong>Encrypted Storage</strong></p>\n<p>https://bitcoin.org/en/secure-your-wallet</p>\n<p>Encryption basically makes the contents of something unreadable without a password or key. It\u2019s the same technology Bitcoin uses to secure transactions and we recommend you use it yourself to protect your important documents. Remember if you lose access to the password, or key for an encrypted file, just like Bitcoin is near impossible to recover.</p>\n<p>Veracrypt - https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/</p>\n<p>Veracrypt is a secure solution to encrypting a single file, creating an encrypted directory or encrypting a volume. This is important because when you store Bitcoin private keys or other private information, you may wish to encrypt it. Armory and Electrum already use password encryption for stored files, but if you wish to export a plain text key, or have an extra level of security, you can use veracrypt to create an encrypted storage environment.</p>\n<p>Keepassx - https://www.keepassx.org/downloads/</p>\n<p>Keepassx is a handy password wallet, which you can use to backup login credentials, private key and other text information in a database that is encrypted.</p>\n<p><strong>Charting</strong></p>\n<p>tradingview http://tradingview.com</p>\n<p>comprehensive online charting tool, with community features.

Digital Gold is from a journalistic perspective, and more accessible whereas Mastering Bitcoin is an in-depth technical perspective. For the trader, Digital Gold is probably a better fit.</p>\n<p>Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money</p>\n<p>Description: Bitcoin, the landmark digital money and financial technology, has spawned a global social movement with utopian ambitions. The notion of a new currency, maintained by the computers of users around the world, has been the butt of many jokes, but that has not stopped it from growing into a technology worth billions of dollars, supported by the hordes of followers who have come to view it as the most important new idea since the creation of the internet. Believers from Beijing to Buenos Aires see the potential for a financial system free from banks and governments, and a new global money for the digital age. An unusual tale of group invention, Digital Gold tells the story of the colorful characters who have built Bitcoin, including a Finnish college student, an Argentinian millionaire, a Chinese entrepreneur, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Bitcoin's elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, and the founder of the Silk Road online drug market, Ross Ulbricht. With Digital Gold, New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper offers a brilliant and engrossing account of this new technology\u2014one filled with dramatic booms and busts that have led to untold riches for some and prison terms for others. But at each step of the way, Bitcoin has provided one of the most fascinating tests of how money works, who benefits from it, and what it might look like in the future..</p>\n<p>Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies</p>\n<p>Description: Want to join the technological revolution that\u2019s taking the world of finance by storm? Mastering Bitcoin is your guide through the seemingly complex world of bitcoin, providing the requisite knowledge to help you participate in the internet of money. Whether you\u2019re building the next killer app, investing in a startup, or simply curious about the technology, this practical book is essential reading. Bitcoin, the first successful decentralized digital currency, is still in its infancy and it\u2019s already spawned a multi-billion dollar global economy. This economy is open to anyone with the knowledge and passion to participate. Mastering Bitcoin provides you with the knowledge you need (passion not included). This book includes: A broad introduction to bitcoin\u2014ideal for non-technical users, investors, and business executives An explanation of the technical foundations of bitcoin and cryptographic currencies for developers, engineers, and software and systems architects Details of the bitcoin decentralized network, peer-to-peer architecture, transaction lifecycle, and security principles Offshoots of the bitcoin and blockchain inventions, including alternative chains, currencies, and applications User stories, analogies, examples, and code snippets illustrating key technical concepts</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Whitepaper: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</p>\n<p>For Advanced Users it\u2019s worth checking out the white paper. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</p>\n<p>Nakamoto Institute - http://nakamotoinstitute.org/</p>\n<p>Also for advanced Users this is a background of literature that led to Bitcoin http://nakamotoinstitute.org/literature/</p>\n<p><strong>Community</strong></p>\n<p>bitcointalk - http://bitcointalk.org</p>\n<p>the official forum of Bitcoin.

I\u2019ll try to explain the main deference between them. For example, I\u2019ll tell you about their sizes, stings, behavior, vital activity, usefulness and so on. \n<a href=http://bezvrediteley.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/192cfdf4c7cad6223ca60f5bdab203c6-600x256.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\nThe sizes\n===\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YA7yEng.jpg)\n<a href=http://receptymeda.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/658799.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\nYes, two these interesting insects have a pretty similar black and yellow color. However, the bees are much smaller than the wasps. Have you ever seen two these insects together? Wasps are really huge comparing with bees. Moreover, they make a little bit different sound. The buzzed \u00ablanguage\u00bb of these insects is a huge another topic. I\u2019ll just tell you that wasps are louder than bees. \nAdding to that, the shape of the bee\u2019s and swap\u2019s body is different too. Yes, they have similar black and yellow color but this color, actually, is different. Bee has a more rounded body shape. Its cover has villi; the color is muted. The \tswap has a smooth elongated body and very bright colors.   \n\nVital activity and usefulness\n===\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jI0VAbJ.jpg)\n<a href=http://www.veselinka.ru/uploads/posts/2012-05/1337606201_med01.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\nBees are toilers because of their nature. They are ready to work endless for the good of their hive. The food of bees is a flowers\u2019 nectar. They can\u2019t eat something else, the flowers\u2019 nectar is their just one their food. Bees plays a very important economical and agricultural role. Collecting nectar of flowers, bees produce a variety of useful and healthy products that people use in pharmaceuticals and human nutrition. The bees even use industrially in the open fields. Bees\u2019 honeycombs are erected by their own wax by people. \n\nThe wasps aren\u2019t able to produce any useful products. They make their hives from the different wastes. All these waste can be really different but in the most of cases aren\u2019t useful at all. The nutrition of wasps is diversely enough. They can eat both fruits and nectar. That\u2019s because we always can meet swaps near the fruit stalls at the trades. Moreover, swaps can even eat flies and other small insects. They can even eat the meat products in the towns and cities. \nHowever, wasps are not that useless. They are not useful for people but they\u2019re very useful for nature. For example, they play a very important ecological role: adult wasps visit the places of juice on the trunks of trees (in particular, elm and aspen) and inflorescences of various plants. \nBy the way, wasps are smart enough: wasps actively catch various small insects, including bees, but mostly small caterpillars, the flies-eristaly and various two-wing insects to feed the young workers. \n\nBehavior\n===\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m2HLpgk.jpg)\n<a href=http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6614/137106206.1cd/0_9dad2_1aa89c0_orig.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\nThe bees sting just if they see a real dangerous, just in an emergence situation. Moreover, they do it just if someone attack them first and they must protect thir hive. The bee dies immediately after the sting and lost her sting in the body of its rival. \nThere\u2019s a certain hierarchy in the family of bees. The highest position always takes bee calls \u00abqueen\u00bb. All bees care about her well-being because just queen is able to multiply the hive. The bees create all conditions for her comfortable existence at winter. \nThe wasp is an aggressive insect enough. Molestation and ability to sting at any time are the main characteristics of wasp. Adding to that, wasps don\u2019t die after their sting. Moreover, the wasp use the jaw apparatus for protecting of rivals, what isn\u2019t characteristically for insects of this family. The queen spends the winter alone; it doesn\u2019t have helpers or securities. It leaves larvae and build a nest in the whole loneliness. \n\nThe sting\n===\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hzAJ5jw.jpg)\n<a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IV-QmE9-I80/VEbH03_i7XI/AAAAAAAAHLQ/M5BoiJfA-i4/s1600/StingersComparison.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\nMany sources indicate that bees unlike swaps have serrated sting. That\u2019s not exactly like that. Wasps have developed a more perfect weapon in the process of evolution \u2013 the sting of the predator that is also provided with notches, but the notch smaller than the bee\u2019s one. \nThe most important thing is that there\u2019s not a kind of assembly on the bee\u2019s tip of sting. That\u2019s because wasps can sting for many times and bees die after the first sting. \n\nIn conclusion, I want to say that the main difference is that bees make a great very healthy honey and many other different useful products and die from the first sting. Nowadays people haven\u2019t found any useful products from swaps, moreover, they can sting as many times as they want. \n\n### <p><em>Thank you for your attention!</em></p>\n### <p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kental\"><em>@kental</em></a> <em>with you!</em></p>\n### <p><em>Let's learn beekeeping together!</em></p>\n### <p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kental\"><em>Follow me</em></a> <em>If you want to learn more about beekeeping!</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n### My previous articles:\n- <a href=\"https://steemit.com/bees/@kental/what-s-going-on-when-the-bees-stings-you\">What\u2019s Going on When The Bees Stings You?</a>\n- <a href=\"https://steemit.com/bees/@kental/how-to-unite-bee-families-beekeeping\">How to Unite Bee Families.</a>",

Read it carefully.\nhttp://img11.nnm.me/c/5/1/2/3/780b4e8a7df6f83e03267d90676.jpg\n<a href=\"http://img11.nnm.me/c/5/1/2/3/780b4e8a7df6f83e03267d90676.jpg\">Image Source</a>\n\n## How bees make honey?\n\n<b>Honey flow</b> \u2013 the basic direction of activity of the bees. All the efforts of the nest, collecting and harvesting of honey products. Individual family members have different functions, however, their common goal is <b><em>Honey</em></b>.\n\n### The duties of the bees family: \n\n- search for new sources of pollen and nectar;\n\n- the production of honey and transport it to the hive;\n\n- production of wax and the construction of hundreds of reservoirs for honey mass;\n\n- the packaging of honey in the cells of the honeycomb;\n\n- create new members the Queen bee of the bees family to the future honey flow;\n\n- defence reserves of honey, brood and bee Queen.\nhttp://p4elovodam.ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stroiat-sota.jpg\n<a href=\"http://p4elovodam.ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stroiat-sota.jpg\">Image Source</a>\n\n## The collection of nectar\n\nThe whole process of making honey starts with the collection of nectar. Only the air warms up to 12 degrees, the insects Wake up from their slumber and begin the first cleansing flights, getting rid of cold outside fecal accumulation. How bees make honey only when the first honey plants bloom, have winged workers have enough time to prepare for the season of honey (cleaning the hive, honeycomb, and frame check).\n\nWhat flowers are in bloom, the colony learns from scouts that deal exclusively with those that patrol the area in search of lawns with flowers. Once they find them, using special signaling dance will tell the whole family. A swarm of miners excited and ready to fly to the object. Was headed by the scout bees fly to the honey-gathering place and begin production of nectar and pollen.\n\n## How bees collect nectar ?\nAbout it, you'll look in this video:\nhttps://youtu.be/3fCvkNuUBiQ\n\n## The process of honey production\n\nThe obtained from bees nectar are distributed working bees : one part of it goes to feed the larvae and the honey.\nhttp://www.kartinki24.ru/uploads/gallery/main/312/kartinki24_insects_bees_0019.jpg\n<a href=\"http://www.kartinki24.ru/uploads/gallery/main/312/kartinki24_insects_bees_0019.jpg\">Image Source</a>\n\nHow bees make honey, is a complex, unique process: \n\n- first, bees have long and carefully to chew the nectar. At this time it is actively fermented. Sugar breaks down into glucose and fructose, the substance becomes more digestible. In addition, the saliva of the bee has bactericidal action disinfects nectar and honey derived from it, the longer it is stored;\n\n- ready to chew and sweetness unfolds on a pre-prepared cell. The cells are filled about 2 thirds;\n\n- now the main task \u2013 to accelerate the evaporation of excess moisture. For this, insects flap their wings, raising the temperature in the hive. Gradually, the moisture evaporates and forms a viscous syrup, consisting of 75-80% glucose and fructose and 5% sucrose (the same percentage of Sugars in honey because of its easily digestible);\n\n- a cell of sealed honey wax tubes and left to Mature. In test tubes with wax, also contains enzymes in bee saliva that further disinfect the cells and prevents liquefaction and fermentation of the finished product.\n## How Do Bees Make Honey?\nThis video about it!\nhttps://youtu.be/nZlEjDLJCmg\n\n<em>I like bees and honey. \n\n<em>Thank you for your attention!\n\n<em>@kental with you!\n\n<em>Let's learn beekeeping together!\n\n<em><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kental\">Follow me</a> If you want to learn more about beekeeping! </em>",

I find this idea fascinating and wanted to support it while also challenging myself to write my own bot in PHP. The bot monitors @robinhoodwhale's voting activity and, if there's a new vote, goes ahead and votes on that same post using piston. The idea being, as more people vote up what @robinhoodwhale votes on, the more curation rewards @robinhoodwhale will make and the more visibility those posts will get (making @robinhoodwhale even more valuable to the community).\n\nI worked on the CopyCatVoter bot yesterday and had it running all night. Here's the output from its first day of life:\n\n```\n\u279c  Bots git:(master) \u2717 php CopyCatVoterTest.php\n2016-08-28T02:47:38+00:00\nStarting CopyCatVoter for lukestokes who wants to copy robinhoodwhale...\n\n\n------------ NEW VOTE!

I'm doing this to conserve some voting power for people in my feed, but will probably change that up based on how active I plan to be on Steemit for a given time period.\n\nAll the code for this is on Github here: <a href=\"https://github.com/lukestokes/php-steem-tools\">https://github.com/lukestokes/php-steem-tools</a>. The CopyCatVoter code is <a href=\"https://github.com/lukestokes/php-steem-tools/blob/master/src/SteemTools/Bots/CopyCatVoter.php\">here</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/lukestokes/php-steem-tools/blob/master/tests/Bots/CopyCatVoterTest.php\">code to run it</a> is currently in a test folder. This is basically my embarrassing prototype sandbox play code, but I'm putting it out there publicly in case anyone else wants to play with it also. You'll need to be able to run php and have piston configured with your posting key and have no password on your piston wallet (I hear from @xeroc some changes will be coming in the future to allow for ENV variable for this).\n\nSo why did I do this instead of just using my account at <a href=\"https://streemian.com/\">https://streemian.com/</a> and its curation trail feature? Well, mainly because I wanted to challenge myself. I really like the idea of having my own bot I can tweak and adjust, almost like a pet. I'm already thinking of improvements to make, such as ensuring it will unvote a post if @robinhoodwhale removes a vote.\n\nAlso, I like to have the output available for me to review. I'm not one to automate social media activities, so it took a while for me to warm up to the idea of trusting others to curate good content. I had to trust the hive mind to promote content which will benefit Steemit as a platform. With it running locally, I can easily review the posts and still use that 24 hour window to remove my vote if it's something I don't personally think is beneficial to the network or if it is contrary to my subjective opinion of what I \"like.\"\n\nIf you want to know more about @robinhoodwhale, give them a follow. You can review the list of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11UkN21t27uG9Fo_vRjX8lKasXOU0xIEL4AviCvlMMNw/edit#gid=0\">posts they've already voted for in this spreadsheet</a> which is updated in real time, as far as I understand. Shout out to <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kyriacos\">@kyriacos</a> for the awesome artwork and the <a href=\"https://steemit.chat/channel/robinhood\">robinhood</a> / <a href=\"https://steemit.chat/channel/robinhood-links\">robinhood-links</a> chat channels.\n\nI hope you're having a great weekend!\n**Steem On**\n[![LukeStokes01712.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/14/LukeStokes01712.png)](https://steemit.com/@lukestokes)",

The second problem was the creation of very low-grade tobacco that some people refused to accept as payment. The policy ultimately created low tobacco prices for farmers. In 1682, there were riots and the tobacco crops of various farms were destroyed.</p>\n<p>The non-uniformity of a currency (apart from paper) is a not a trivial problem. Throughout history, it has been a significant issue. In colonial Plymouth, Massachusetts, the Wampanoag Tribe\u2019s wampum was made legal tender at the rate of six white beads or three purple beads per penny. Unfortunately, supply of beads was limited. It was hard for prices to rise in the sense that the bead, as an instrumentality, was not divisible.<sup>(1)</sup></p>\n<p>Historically, therefore, the government really needed to take over responsibility for coinage. That created another problem. How does one prevent the government from abusing the privilege by basically destroying the value of the currency by issuance?</p>\n<p>Enter Bitcoin. It is very hard to counterfeit since all Bitcoin in existence are always visible in the Blockchain ledger. Supply of Bitcoin is fixed; it is hardwired in the code. This is a possible revolution in currency design. If nothing else, it is a new asset class.</p>\n<p><em><sup>(1)</sup>Barry Eichengreen, Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System (New York: Oxford University Press, 2011), 9-10</em></p>\n<p>---------------------</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimers:</em></p>\n<p><em>Horizon Kinetics LLC (\u201cHorizon Kinetics\u201d) is the parent holding company to several SEC-registered investment advisors including Horizon Asset Management LLC, Kinetics Asset Management LLC, and Kinetics Advisers, LLC.

    "body": "![jumpingpeoplesteemitanarchyfaba6.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/jumpingpeoplesteemitanarchyfaba6.jpg)\n\nFor many of us, Steemit has already changed so much - the way we navigate the web, the way we think about money, and for a fortunate committed few, it's even changed their professions. However, the change that I expect from this model goes even deeper. It's possible that Steemit, and descendent technologies, may play a part in creating a voluntary world, a stateless world, in which everyone who takes money from someone, or puts someone in a cage without their consent, or orders such acts, will be seen and treated as a criminal. There are several ways in which Steemit can aid this cause. Let's start with the most important - the conversation.\n\n# It changes the way we talk\n![argument288ba5.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/argument288ba5.jpg)\n## The problem with voluntaryist argumentation\nMany of you might have noticed, and even been a party to, hard-line conversations about anarchy, in which the voluntaryist proceeds to take the words of the other party, and question them about some perceived inconsistency in their beliefs, attempting to lead them through a Socratic dialogue, in order to bring them to accept the truth - that the other party is wrong - very, very wrong. You also might have noticed (as I eventually noticed, after years of banging my head on walls) that this technique almost never works.\n\nOf course, the reason that it doesn't work, is because people have a need to feel that they're being understood, that their concerns are heard, that their thoughts are valid. In brief, they need to feel like people. If you don't treat someone like a person - unless you're talking to an exceptionally patient person - you're unlikely to receive a personable response.\n## An oasis\nThe comment section on YouTube is a running joke. Facebook discussions descend into dirtslinging, strawmen and threats. You may wade through many racist and sexist comments before you find something that is truly valuable information, and even then it may be tainted with aggression. In contrast, Steemit's comments sections seem like a desert oasis - all but filled with calm discussion, respect, insight, or at the very least, positivity. Surely, this is a place where one can have a constructive conversation about controversial topics.\n## The incentive to be good\nI have noticed over these few short months, the way that Steemit has changed the way that I interact with people, especially online - on Steemit and other social networks. I've found myself a few times, even as I'm about to make a statement which is mildly passive-aggressive, thinking \"Hold on - is this something I would write if my reputation were on the line? If not, maybe I shouldn't write it.\" Even when I'm going to give someone some piercing criticism, which, if presented in the wrong way, may seem a condemnation, I can find ways to demonstrate empathy, such as compliments or other niceties.\n\nIt may sound like an unfortunate description of humanity (or of myself) to say it, but when our bank balances and reputations are on the line in every moment, we can find ways to communicate more kindly, and therefore, more fluidly, with the people we interact with.\n## Commitment and consistency\nIn Cialdini's famous and excellent book, [Influence: The psychology of persuasion](http://amzn.to/2c5z38T) he describes how, when people make a commitment to something, they are more likely to see it as part of their identity, and strive to live up to that identity.\n\nWhen people are kind to each other, respectful, and even open-minded on Steemit, it's not just that they're pretending to be nice. By acting nicer, they become nicer. By acting more open-minded, they become more open-minded.\n## The quality of our ideas\nIf the ideas of voluntaryism are as good as we believe they are, then surely a place like Steemit, where people are strongly encouraged to be respectful, considerate, empathetic and even open-minded, would be an ideal place to discuss them. If it turns out that our ideas are not as good as we think they are, then it gives us the perfect medium to discover something even better. That is beautiful.\n# Tax-free and shameless\n![breakchains10ab9.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/breakchains10ab9.png)\nIn many developed countries, taxes are generally seen as legitimate and necessary, and people claim to be proud of paying their taxes - sometimes because they truly believe it, and sometimes because they don't want to face the fact that they have been forced into an elaborate con, from which they have no apparent escape.\u007f\n\nBut what if they did have an escape? What if, instead of being paid as an employee, having their income taxes automatically deducted from their pay, they were paid directly. What if thousands or millions of people were making income, or making a living, this way, and decided to openly flout the tax authority, publicly, knowing that it wouldn't have the resources to pursue any more than a small fraction of the cases?\n\nObviously, that would damage the appearance of legitimacy of the state, and also the perception of omniscience and omnipotence that its proponents tend to ascribe to it.\n# Development of cryptoanarchic solutions\n>\"Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word 'anarchy', in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It\u2019s a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.\"\n> - Wei Dai\n\nWe all know that Steemit/Steem is much more accessible than virtually any other cryptocurrency, being based around a style of platform which more than one billion people are already familiar with. That's pretty cool, and that means that more money will flow into cryptocurrency, meaning more attention, and thus even more development for similar technologies.\n\nMore development in cryptocurrency means more methods to control money, and other forms of information, publicly, privately, or anonymously, without governments being able to do anything about it.\n# Conclusion\nSteemit is an important step, a continuation of the snowball effect of cryptocurrency, leading us to a voluntary, cryptoanarchic future, full of wonders we have not yet imagined, and degrees of freedom as yet unforeseeable. Boldly we take our pens, pads, keyboards and wallets, building a highway to a world where concepts are our language and our tools, but never our weapons, where the purity of ideas is worth fighting for, but never worth fighting with.\n\n---\n\n# About me\n\n[![kurt robinson in the mountains of puebla](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/26/pictureofmecroppedbdb8d.md.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/gsqzK)\n\nMy name is Kurt Robinson.

    "body": "**Currently, there are two ways to get a STEEM Account.** The first is to sign up for Steemit with a Reddit or Facebook account, the second is to create an account using CLI_WALLET or Piston and have the account **permanently linked to your own account.**\n\nNeither option really allows you to be anonymous. Want to post controversial posts, or say something that would otherwise be illegal in your country? (e.g. poor free speech laws) Then Anonsteem is here to help.\n\n## Introducing: @anonsteem\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y6QDDbD.png)\n\nPUBLIC INTERNET: [anon.steem.network](https://anon.steem.network/)\n----\n\nTOR: [steemlohs6air4h2.onion](http://steemlohs6air4h2.onion/)\n----\n\n----\n\n**So what actually is this?**\n\nAnonSteem allows you to purchase an account using either Bitcoin or Litecoin, and it will be created by the @anonsteem account within a minute of payment.\n\nTo protect your privacy, there are no IP logs, we have a TOR hidden service, and we allow you to remove your keys from our server as soon as you create the account.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4aa6tR7.png)\n\nWe give you detailed instructions on changing your keys after creating the account, so you can be sure we're not just going to steal your account later on.\n\nHow long does it take to get an account?\n-----\n\nTransactions are scanned once a minute, and we accept 0 confirmation transactions. This means you'll most likely have your account within 1-2 minutes of sending the payment, regardless of which coin you paid with.\n\nCan I pay with STEEM?\n----\n\nWe don't accept STEEM directly, as that would ruin your privacy. However, if you REALLY want to pay with STEEM, you can send it via [ShapeShift (precise mode)](https://shapeshift.io/#/inputs/2) to the BTC or LTC address you get during payment.\n\nDoesn't this service mean more spambots?\n----\n\nWe don't have any plans to allow en-masse account creation. Every order has to be placed one at a time, with individual payments. Someone looking to create spam bots would most likely look elsewhere.\n\nAnonsteem is targeted at persons or groups looking for one, or a few accounts, with no social media link, and no third party tracking.\n\n**HELP - my transaction expired?** - The 15 minute limit is just to avoid us checking transactions for abandoned orders. If you've already paid, just PM me on SteemitChat, or send me an email (bottom of the anonsteem page) with your order ID and I'll reset the expiry.\n\nTry it out at [anon.steem.network](https://anon.steem.network)\n----\n\nDo you like what I'm doing? Follow me, and [vote for @someguy123 to be a witness](https://steemit.com/~witnesses)\n====",

There would be knifes, and sometimes guns.\n\nThere would be other customers, many of them equally shady.\n\nMeth, cocaine, bath salts, all that stuff.\n\n*\"No, just looking for some acid\"* (for the 5th time..)\n\nUnder the eyes of the law, they are all equally bad: this dirty bag called **drugs** - let's fit everything in there and pretend there's no difference.\n\nRegardless of the purpose or the substance, if you partake, you're the scum of the earth.\n\nWhere I'm from, that's how it goes. It's not pretty.\n\n# Enter the Silk Road\n\n![](https://pointsadhsblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/silk-road-logo.jpg)\n\nWhen news of the silk road hit the internet, a quiet revolution begun taking place.\n\nWhile the mainstream media was busy demonizing this new underground market, **hundreds of thousands** of **PEACEFUL**, **LAW-ABIDING** (well, almost), **MINDING-MY-OWN-BUSINESS**, **PEACE-AND-LOVE-YO** people a bit all over the world had a different story to tell.\n\nNo longer were they - **we** - risking our safety, health, and sometimes our life to obtain the chemical keys to unlock hidden parts of our consciousness, it could now all be done from the comfort of our living rooms.\n\nMix some bitcoins, select what and how much, click purchase - wait some days or weeks, and it all conveniently arrives by mail.\n\n# A more efficient market\n\nNot only were the drugs more pure, they were also misrepresented less often.\n\nDealers now had a **global reputation** attached to them, and you'd be surprised how much that is worth when **all you have is your reputation**.\n\nDuring years of using the markets, and watching friends do the same - **not once were we scammed** by all those faceless anonymous dealers of the underground.\n\n**Not a single time**!\n\nAs cautious psychonauts, we tested our drugs, too. They were never mislabeled, and the quality was superb.\n\nThe amounts were what they should be, except one time (10% was missing) -- and on the next order, this faceless internet dealer sent 30% extra, so that there'd be no questions that it was an honest mistake.\n\n# The doors of perception\n\n![](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2F736x%2Fc0%2F7c%2F7d%2Fc07c7d783bf09a40e87fa25cbf7b73ac.jpg&f=1)\n\nWe tripped. A lot.\n\nIf you don't do drugs, it's easy to be condescending and moralizing about it.\n\nLook - I don't like alcohol, **but I'm perfectly ok with those who do**.\nI'm not gay - **but I'm perfectly fine with gay people**.\n\nA little tolerance is all we ask - we're not the wicked demons that the media makes us to be.\n\n<center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWVxI6XZAuE</center>\n\nPerhaps you don't understand why someone would ingest random chemicals obtained from the internet.\n\nThe opinions I've heard the most from people who're not into this, is that they think we're chasing pleasure. Fun. Recreation. Avoiding responsibilities, living in a fantasy world.\n\n**Nothing could be further from the truth** -- but that's a story for another post.\n\nIn the mean time, perhaps this'll help:\n\n<center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNYJ1lesl3M</center>\n\n# Unleashing the Mind\n\n![](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.M21334068147f7b06a72341c3b8f6bacao0%26pid%3D15.1&f=1)\n\nAs I was saying. We tripped - a lot.\n\nSometimes alone, sometimes with a close group of friends - we'd set out for crazy adventures of the inner space, landing in other dimensions, other universes, other states of mind, other states of being.\n\nIt's truly fascinating how versatile human consciousness can be - with the right catalyst.\n\nIt's precisely the catalyst that has been stolen away from humankind -- with most of us not even realizing that this theft took place -- a truly bizarre situation, once you become aware of what's been stolen from you.\n\nIn between the propaganda, the false statistics, the moralistic dogma, the outright lies, distortions and half-truths, the general public has been led to believe that there is nothing but suffering, hedonism and addiction in taking those substances.\n\n<center>![](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.M5fa84a45173078058f7ffcac14a9800bo0%26pid%3D15.1&f=1)</center>\n\nYou could very easily find out - take 400ug of [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide) (**warning**: don't) and watch in awe (and terror) as everything you thought was true about this reality shattering right in front of you.\n\n<center>![](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-rF-0muM4NH8%2FU-wg4v6DaGI%2FAAAAAAAAHtA%2Fh6-1i_XY9wM%2Fs1600%2FPsychedelics%252Bare%252Billegal%252Bnot%252Bbecause%252Ba%252Bloving%252Bgovernment%252Bis%252Bconcerned%252Bthat%252Byou%252Bmay%252Bjump%252Bout%252Bof%252Ba%252Bthird%252Bstory%252Bwindow.%252B-Terence%252BMcKenna.jpg&f=1)</center>\n\nBut, like most people, I know you won't.\n\nAnd that's ok.\n\n**What is not ok** is that the majority prevents us - the sailors of the mind, the explorers, the artists, the curious, from exploring these **vast, uncharted realms of the human mind**.\n\n<center>![](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fc1.staticflickr.com%2F5%2F4144%2F5200402190_d4c4608733_z.jpg&f=1)</center>\n\nFor daring to explore, for daring to question, we're ostracized, sent to jail..\n\n# The outcome\n\nHaving ready access to so many psychedelic substances over the years has **irreversibly changed who I am** and what I think about the very nature and inner workings of this reality we all share.\n\nI'm a better friend, a better lover, a better father and a better human being for it.\n\nI'll tell you right here, sometimes it was too much.

he broke the law.\n\nBut breaking the law is what one must do if the law is draconic, unfair, and unreasonable.\n\n**History will set things right**, but in the mean time there's a young lad rotting away in prison for the crime of making some of the most wonderful tools we as a species have at our disposal to explore the essence of what makes us, us - our consciousness - available to anyone who's interested.\n\nAll over the world, drug laws are a mess -- in no small part due to the undue influence the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) has globally, in this case through the [UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations).\n\nWe have hundreds of thousands of people in jail for smoking plants, or eating some foul-tasting mushrooms.\n\nEntire lives ruined at the ripe old age of **16**.\n\nAspiring entrepreneurs like **Ross** sitting behind bars, his only crime being making available what should've been available to any adult in the first place.\n\n<center>![](https://s15.postimg.io/c1fuj2fmj/ross2.png)</center>\n\nWe've got to change this.\n\nEven if -

    "body": "Good Morning - Here is my Analysis of todays markets, looking into Bitshares, Steem, Gold, Oil S&P and many many more.

Every candle is 4 hours, so even if you watch this TA later today or even later this week, the 4 hour chart is great for longer term perspectives. \n\nI could do one on the Daily Chart as well, where each candle is one day, that would give us a very long timeframe that is not really funny to trade from, the 4 hour is therefore the best one to make money today and for the rest of the week.\n\nIf you have any questions, please come to SteemSpeak and ask them there as I will not be watching the comment section too much during the next 8 hours as I will have my eyes on the charts and on <a href=\"http://1broker.uk\">1broker.uk</a> \n\n<center><h1>Here are the charts - Video is at the bottom:</h1></center>\n\n---\n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/TDRDTT4V\"/></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/TDRDTT4V\">Expand Chart</a></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/bwco3zBY\"/></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/bwco3zBY\">Expand Chart</a></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/1O4E3YUh\"/></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/1O4E3YUh\">Expand Chart</a></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/PgUz2efn\"/></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/PgUz2efn\">Expand Chart</a></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/qqeC0rq5\"/></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/qqeC0rq5\">Expand Chart</a></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/HaHdbwdx\"/></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/HaHdbwdx\">Expand Chart</a></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/LUVDLoSo\"/></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/LUVDLoSo\">Expand Chart</a></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/WLiVsGkc\"/></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/WLiVsGkc\">Expand Chart</a></center>\n\n<center><h1>The Video:</h1></center>\n---\n<center>https://youtu.be/dyXt_kJhomU</center>\n(I don\u00b4t know why it won\u00b4t center, am I doing something wrong?)\n---\n<center>For best charts - go to https://www.tradingview.com - it is free.</center>\n---\n<center>Thank you for studying and watching, happy trading :)</center>\n---",

Cryptobuyers also values the importance of being fully compliant with local and international legal frameworks and legislations.Cryptobuyer's latest product comes thanks to a partnership with VISA (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance?q=visa&amp;ei=_jvYV_KVMs6_et-wtaAD\">NYSE:V</a>), the companies reached an agreement to emit a&nbsp;<strong>free Bitcoin Debit Card</strong>, making easy for people around the world to send money to their Venezuelan family and friends. The debit card can be reloaded with the equivalent bitcoin balance in Venezuelan Bolivars, enabling people to spend their coins or withdrawing local currency in the vast network of point-of-sales or ATMs. All without the need of a bank account or intermediaries like traditional remittance companies.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>It's very exciting for us to see our dreams come to fruition to be the very first Venezuelan company to offer real-world solutions, using the power of Blockchain technology, not only to tech-savvy individuals but to the general population who is undergoing a severe economic crisis, enabling them to buy food, medicines, and first necessity items. It has been and arduous process, but we firmly believe that it will pay-off with the joy we may bring to the people undergoing harsh circumstances.&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This new solution is another addition to Cryptobuyer's ever-expanding product offerings, like mobile top-ups, payments of TV subscriptions, and direct bank deposits, additionally the company is undergoing the process of securing agreements with bitcoin ATM operators around the world, which already includes Panama's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tigoctm.com/\">TigoCTM</a>, and ATMs in Portugal, Spain, Mexico and the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xSVJS1bt1g</p>\n<p>All of those countries have significant amounts of Venezuelan immigrants, so they can easily buy Bitcoin to send to their families and friends in need.&nbsp;Cryptobuyer's Visa Electron debit card is being offered right now, free of charge at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cryptobuyer.io/\">www.cryptobuyer.io</a>. There are no associated shipping costs for Venezuelans or foreigners with a Venezuelan ID. The card has no maintenance fees and has a recharge limit of 1,000,000 VEF (Venezuelan Bolivars) \u2013which at the time of press accounts for approximately&nbsp;950 USD. The card can only be used inside Venezuelan borders, however,&nbsp;<strong>the company has plans to release an international bitcoin debit card in the next weeks</strong>, so keep in touch as further details will be made available through the official channels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptobuyer.io/\">Cryptobuyer's website</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptobuyer\">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cryptobuyer/\">Facebook</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cryptobuyer/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;accounts.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "# Hello steemit,\n\nwelcome back to my blog!\n\nIn the case that you never have heard about the **PermaCryptoFolio experiment**, I recommend you to [read the PermaCryptoFolio announcement first](https://steemit.com/money/@twinner/financial-freedom-lifelong-with-minimal-effort-introducing-the-permacryptofolio-system-a-public-trading-experiment-using-real). \n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/D6Ms1jB.png</center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wzC8MJg.png\n\n# The PermaCryptoFolio experiment\nThe PermaCryptoFolio experiment is a passive investment strategy, which invests in Bitcoin, Altcoins and Cash (US-Dollar) with the aim to outperfom a simple Bitcoin-\"BuyAndHold\" strategy.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wzC8MJg.png\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/dEeSgZY.png</center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wzC8MJg.png\n\nToday I introduced the 3 different portfolios \"NEMO\", \"DORY\" and \"FLIPPER\". \n\n# The NEMO depot\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wzC8MJg.png\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/y1qu9Kj.png</center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wzC8MJg.png\n\n\"Nemo\" is small, but clever, and for NEMO depot the same applies. NEMO depot will invest 1/3 in Bitcoin, 1/3 in the major 8 altcoins and 1/3 in cash (US-Dollar) with an initial investment of 1 Bitcoin. The depot is traded on Bittrex exchange. This experiment starts on 1st of september 2016. [Find full specification and rules of NEMO portfolio here.](https://steemit.com/permacryptofolio/@twinner/permacryptofolio-introducing-the-nemo-depot) \n\n# The DORY depot\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wzC8MJg.png\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/w9z8ppv.png</center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wzC8MJg.png\n\n\"Dory\" likes it simple, and the DORY depot is very simple. DORY depot will invest 50% in Bitcoin and 50% in US Dollar with an initial investment of 1 Bitcoin. The depot is traded on Kraken exchange. This experiment starts on 1st of september 2016. [Find full specification and rules of DORY portfolio here.](https://steemit.com/permacryptofolio/@twinner/permacryptofolio-introducing-the-dory-depot) \n\n# The FLIPPER depot\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wzC8MJg.png\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/PyP4Vnb.png</center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wzC8MJg.png\n\n\"Flipper\" is friendly and sympatic as Nemo, but much stronger. Same applies for the FLIPPER portfolio. FLIPPER depot will also invest 1/3 in Bitcoin, 1/3 in the major 8 altcoins and 1/3 in cash (US-Dollar, but with an initial investment of 12 Bitcoin. The depot is traded on Poloniex exchange, but for security reasons the invested funds are withdrawn to cold wallets. This experiment starts on 1st of september 2016. [Find full specification and rules of FLIPPER portfolio here.](https://steemit.com/permacryptofolio/@twinner/permacryptofolio-introducing-the-flipper-depot) \n\n# Follow me\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wzC8MJg.png\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/KiJ7JZb.png</center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wzC8MJg.png\n\nIf you want to get updates about this project, and you are already on twitter, facebook or google+, please follow one of the hyperlinks.\n\n|Media|Link|\n|---|--|\n|**twitter**|https://twitter.com/PermaCryptFolio|\n|**facebook**|https://www.facebook.com/perma.cryptofolio|\n|**google+**|https://plus.google.com/u/0/117852408743580495329|\n|**steemit**|https://steemit.com/@twinner|\n|**e-mail**|http://i.imgur.com/3qdosyK.png|\n\n# Disclaimer\nThe author is already invested in all of the cryptocurrencies mentioned in this article.

    "body": "<html>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.horizonkinetics.com/images/horizon_kinetics_logo_blue_Small.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><em>Originally Published July 2016</em></p>\n<p>On June 17, 2016, history recorded that the yields on 10-year Italian and Spanish government bonds were actually lower than the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Spanish government bonds yielded 1.55% and Italian government bonds yielded 1.51%. The U.S. Treasury 10-year bonds yielded 1.62%.<sup>(1)</sup></p>\n<p>Since most observers would agree that Spain and Italy are not better credits than the United States of America, one can immediately dismiss any notion of the efficient market at work. These yields merely represent the result of massive purchases by the European Central Bank. One of the many consequences of such policies is that the Swiss 10-year government bond yield is now negative 54 basis points.<sup>(1)</sup> In fact, in some countries apart from Switzerland, the so-called risk-free rate is negative.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The idea of a negative risk-free rate is a contradiction in terms, since it guarantees that the risk-free outcome results in a loss. However, in the highly abstruse world of modern financial theory, a guaranteed loss does not qualify as a risk. A risk is only an uncertain outcome that expresses itself as volatility.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the rigorous mathematical treatment by financial orthodoxy, a small but nevertheless growing contingent rejects the notion that governments, central banks, and PhD economists should have the right to assure a person who saves not only of a loss in purchasing power but also of an actual loss in nominal value.</p>\n<p>It is forgotten by the economists, central bankers, as well as financial journalists that money existed long before there were financial journalists, central bankers, and economists. In other words, people used money long before there were mathematical models that purported to explain it. Archeologists will verify that cattle and grain were used as money or units of account at least 17,000 years ago and possibly as long as 19,000 years ago. It might be recalled by those conversant with the Bible that in Genesis 23, Abraham purchased the Cave of the Patriarchs, otherwise known as the Cave of Machpelah, for 400 shekels of silver. Note that the silver weight equivalent to 400 shekels was established before silver futures, organized exchanges, algorithmic trading, modern portfolio theory, and central banks, among other modern innovations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Interestingly, archeologists reliably inform us that long before the Roman Republic, throughout the ancient world, a shekel was precisely defined in terms of a specific weight of barley. This should not surprise anyone. The British pound sterling was originally just a pound of silver; it was called the pound sterling and not the silver pound because sterling is an alloy of silver and copper containing 92.5% silver and 7.25% copper. It contains a few other ingredients, as well. In other words, sterling has a fineness of 0.925. The pre-modern British did not choose to use fine silver, which is 99.9% pure silver, because they were practically oriented. Pure silver is too soft to use as a coin, which may be roughly handled. The coin needed to be sufficiently hard to retain its weight as it circulated in the economy.</p>\n<p>This very abbreviated history should be sufficient to demonstrate that anything that human beings agree upon as a unit of account or money can actually be money. Since the central banks and governments of the world appear determined to lessen the purchasing power of money, it should not be surprising to learn that new forms of money are constantly evolving. A recently popular form of money is cryptocurrency. There are perhaps 660 cryptocurrencies in the world today; however, the dominant one is Bitcoin. According to CoinMarketCap.com, Bitcoin now has an 84% market share.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin operates as an open ledger called a blockchain. The entire history of Bitcoin on a cumulative basis is contained on the blockchain. For example, as of this writing, according to blockchain.info, there are 15,671,550 bitcoins in existence. Every day, 3,600 Bitcoins are created; ergo, one year ago from the date of this writing, there were 14,357,550 Bitcoins (i.e., 365 x 3,600 or 1,314,000 fewer bitcoins were in existence). According to blockchain.info there were 3,595,936 Bitcoin wallets.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin wallets store the private keys needed to execute transactions on the bitcoin network. At the time of this writing, there were a total of 7,657,584 Bitcoin wallets. In other words, 4,061,648 Bitcoin wallets were created at the same time as 1,314,000 Bitcoins were created. The system, on average, creates 0.3235 Bitcoins for every wallet created. Another way of expressing this phenomenon is to state that over the course of the past year, 11,127 Bitcoin wallets have been created on a daily basis in relation to 3,600 Bitcoins created each day. More recently, about 12,000 Bitcoin wallets are created on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On or about July 9, 2016, the daily creation amount of Bitcoins will decline to precisely 1,800 units.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Virtually all financial practitioners, including financial planners, and especially academic economists, are united in the belief that Bitcoin is a momentary fad that will soon pass. The portfolios of pension funds, insurance companies, and banks are replete with low-yielding\u2014or, in many cases, negatively-yielding\u2014government paper. These are considered the low risk assets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In other words, a Swiss government bond with a negative yield and a 10-year maturity is considered a low-risk asset, even though a simple convexity calculation would easily demonstrate that if the Swiss government bond were to yield 3%, the holder of that instrument would experience a calamitous loss in terms of Swiss francs. Moreover, if Swiss yields were to increase less than the euro or dollar yields for some reason, there would be another loss in the value of the Swiss franc relative to these other currencies.</p>\n<p>Is Bitcoin really more dangerous than these other accepted instrumentalities for use as a store of value? Is Bitcoin really so dangerous that a portfolio could not survive a 10 or 20 basis point exposure? None of these questions are ever posed, since the debate is framed in the context of government or central bank action.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On one hand, the deflationists argue quite convincingly that democratic societies cannot possibly inflate and destroy the value of the purchasing power of many millions of retirees and soon-to-be retirees. These people are politically active, so to inflate and destroy the purchasing power of pensions is simply political suicide. Even if a given politician or group of politicians were willing to commit political suicide in the national interest, the gesture would be quite futile because the pensioners have the political power to remove any inflation-minded government. Hence, this group argues that a German government 10-year bond that might yield 3 to 4 basis points on a good day is a good investment, since debt-induced deflation will lower prices, and the real value of such a bond will increase even if its nominal value will not.</p>\n<p>The inflationists take the opposing view. They argue that it would be political suicide to allow deflation to run its course and thereby compel debtors of all sorts to repay loans in nominal dollars when prices and incomes are falling. In fact, it can be argued that government tax revenue would undoubtedly decline and, at least on the national level, governments would be compelled to monetize the debt by central bank purchases of that debt. Any effort at deflation is merely a prelude to inflation. In any case, the debtors have the power to remove from office any officials that are inclined to tolerate deflation. Ultimately, the power of the electorate is paramount in a democracy.</p>\n<p>In the last 100 years of history, one can find plentiful examples to support each of these views. However, the more significant point is that the average person has neither the skill nor the inclination to judge which of these views is correct. The power to decide the value of money in terms of purchasing power is a weighty responsibility. It is almost always abused. It is difficult to think of a single instance in which such a power was used wisely, although there probably are such instances.</p>\n<p>Perhaps as a consequence, the great financial innovations in terms of store of value were invented by people instead of governments. Trade bills of exchange evolved from commercial activities at medieval fairs. Fractional reserve banking was developed by goldsmiths, not by central bankers. In fact, fractional reserve banking predates the origin of central banks. Paper money was introduced in the Song Dynasty in China during the 11th century. Its origin was in the receipts of merchants who wished to avoid carrying metal coins. In fact, the Western world only learned of paper money through Marco Polo and the account of paper money is the subject of an entire chapter in the book <em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em>.</p>\n<p>History records that anything that can attain a universal trust as to value can become money. Ultimately, anything that serves as money that is not trusted will not serve as a store of value, whatever the government or central bank might determine. By structure and common consent, Bitcoin has a fixed issuance of 21 million units, to be realized in the year 2140. Starting on July 10, 2016, daily issuance will be 1,800 units, or 657,000 per annum. More than 12,000 Bitcoin wallets are opened every 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If there were 76 million Bitcoin wallets instead of the current 7.6 million, this would be a tenfold increase, still representing only 1.1% of the individuals on the planet. Note that on the day this data was retrieved, the number of wallets was 7.6 million; tomorrow it will probably be 7.7 million. Moreover, the number of people on the planet is not a proper denominator, because there are countless businesses as well as other organizations that must deal in money, so the penetration rate is still less than one-tenth of 1%.</p>\n<p>Consequently, if the inflation theory is alluring, one might consider the purchase of gold. If the deflation theory is alluring, one might consider the purchase of a 10-year Swiss government bond with a yield to maturity of -54 basis points per annum. However, these scenarios are too complex to be predicted accurately. If one knows no more about economics than an understanding of the laws of supply and demand, perhaps one should buy some Bitcoin.</p>\n<p><em><sup>(1)</sup> On July 6, 2016 U.S. Treasury 10-year bonds yielded 1.38%, Spain\u2019s 10-year government bonds yielded 1.18%, Italy\u2019s 1.24%, and Switzerland\u2019s -0.68%.</em></p>\n<p>---------------------</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimers:</em></p>\n<p><em>Horizon Kinetics LLC (\u201cHorizon Kinetics\u201d) is the parent holding company to several SEC-registered investment advisors including Horizon Asset Management LLC, Kinetics Asset Management LLC, and Kinetics Advisers, LLC.

    "body": "Hi you all! Ross and I are so pleased that I\u2019m here and part of this innovative community and technology. I\u2019m glad to have the chance to tell my story directly to you -- to fill you in on the past three years of my life and my battle to free Ross.\n<center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yw2Vy4x-KQ</center>\n\nMy son Ross Ulbricht -- a peaceful, idealistic humanitarian \u2013was  tried and sentenced to double life without parole for all non-violent charges relating to his role in the Silk Road website. Silk Road was a free market experiment: a voluntary, anonymous marketplace that operated on the tor network using the crypto currency bitcoin. Many things, both legal and illegal, were exchanged, although there were restrictions of things considered harmful by the administration. For example, there was no child porn, murder-for-hire or stolen goods on the site. Drug sales were permitted, with marijuana the main product that was bought and sold.\n\nSince Ross\u2019 arrest it\u2019s been a David and Goliath fight against the US government. The investigation, pre-trial events, trial and sentencing are so rife with abuse and corruption that it\u2019s impossible to cover everything. Here are some major issues:\n\n<center> http://i.imgsafe.org/49dec2fca2.png</center>\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a wild and crazy three years to say the least. Since Ross\u2019 arrest I\u2019ve strived to the limits of my strength to direct attention beyond the sensationalism to the important precedents and issues at stake in this case and how they impact our freedoms in the digital age. In addition to Ross\u2019 release, my goal is to shine a light on the alarming loss of our liberty while raising funds to defend Ross. (Any payments from here go 100% to Ross\u2019 defense). This is basically my life now, with some down time sprinkled in.\n\nThings weren\u2019t always like this, and I often shake my head wondering how I got here! Before Ross\u2019 arrest I was the gracefully aging mother of two beautiful, well-adjusted adults, hoping for grandchildren and planning the rest of my life. I had pretty much retired from freelance writing and was continuing to work with Kirk, Ross\u2019 dad, in our business, Casa Bambu. (We rent bamboo houses that Kirk built to vacationers, off grid in the Costa Rican rainforest). One day I led a relatively tranquil life and the next I was falling, like Alice through the looking glass, into a bizarre world of the dark web, encrypted communications, digital currency, and the drug war. A right-brained, tech-resistant ex- hippie, I had only owned a smart phone for a month, had never been on twitter and barely heard of bitcoin (and only from Ross). When Ross was arrested I suddenly -- and urgently -- had to become adept at social media, public relations, fundraising, pgp, bitcoin and criminal law.  \n\nIt was urgent because I had to save my beloved son.\n\n<center>https://i.imgsafe.org/31d2386203.jpg</center>\n<center>Ross and Lyn shortly before his arrest</center>\n\nSo now my life is dominated by the fictional entity Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR) and I\u2019ve been on a crash course to do whatever it takes to free Ross: blog, comment, tweet, follow, unfollow, like, unlike, friend, unfriend, defend, raise funds, encrypt, decrypt, build websites, write press releases, give speeches, give interviews, challenge journalists, translate legalese, learn digital-speak \u2013 and now post on steem.it.  I have twitter followers all over the world, from Russia to Spain, from Australia to India.  I\u2019ve been called a jedi, a storm trooper, Dread Mother Roberts, a hero, a \u201cleading internet freedom activist and social media pro\u201d and a badass (fondly, by the lawyer).  Also some nasty things on the internet, but I\u2019m getting a thick skin.\n\nThe learning curve has been steep. Sensationalistic media; aggressive prosecutors; biased judges; cruel prison staff \u2013 the opponents are formidable and ruthless. But there have also been invaluable allies, like many of you, and that plus divine intervention has gotten us this far.  I have made so many courageous, generous, amazing friends on this journey. They are people I never would have met and it has enriched my life, given me hope. I\u2019ve often thought that the past three years would have been some of the most interesting, purposeful and exciting of my life except that Ross is in prison and that makes them the most traumatic, painful and difficult as well. As long as he\u2019s in there, I will not \u2013 cannot -- rest.\n \n <center>https://i.imgsafe.org/31d247242c.jpg</center>\n<center>Lyn speaking at porcfest.</center>\n\nThis journey has taken me from a prison in interior Brooklyn to an interview in a multimillion dollar Soho loft (on the same afternoon); from high priced attorney offices to clandestine meetings; from a freedom festival in New Hampshire to trudging through Austin streets hanging posters at SXSW (and then speaking there the following year).  Never having addressed audiences, I\u2019ve now spoken at numerous events, both in the US and Europe (including Porcfest, FreedomFest and the national Libertarian convention); appeared on a range of TV, radio and podcast shows, including Reason TV, CNN, HuffPost Live, Infowars and Fox; and given many interviews with both major and alternative media , including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Forbes and The Guardian. Along with Ross, I am prominently featured in the documentary Deep Web.\n\n Never in my wildest dreams would I have believed this would be my fate. \n\nPursuing American justice is expensive and the challenge is great, but I\u2019m fueled by a mother\u2019s love and now a righteous anger at government abuse. I have seen first-hand how prosecutors lie and obstruct. I have visited the prison with other families, desperate to see loved ones, the children tearfully clinging to their fathers. I personally know non-violent people rotting their lives away in captivity.  My perspective has changed forever.\n\nBesides my love for Ross and resistance to tyranny, a crucial thing that keeps me going is my faith in God. I have faced some of the darkest places in my mind, fear gripping me, my thoughts screaming, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this! They\u2019re too big!\u201d Yet I find peace and hope when I can turn the burden over and take on that day\u2019s fight once again. I have felt God\u2019s hand in this throughout, in many ways, large and small. There has been the unlikely but perfect timing of events; the right people arriving at the right time; doors opening when all seemed closed; the impossible occurring against all odds. I pray each day that God will use me, Ross and this situation for good and that it will shine a spotlight on evil. And of course that Ross will be out of that cage, in freedom where he belongs. \n\nThis is a bigger, more far reaching story than one man or website.  There are vital issues at play, ones that impact us all and are worth fighting for. We are in unchartered territory in the courts. Decisions and precedent made now, with the Silk Road case and others, will have far-reaching impact on freedom, innovation, fair trials and privacy.\n\n<center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8gR7jAG2U&amp;list=PLPefjTxHVZSo-zoK-Bap56eihCqhBn75N&amp;index=55</center>\n<center>The Unfairness of the Silk Road trial in 3 minutes</center>\n\nWe are at a crossroads in history. The question and challenge is which road will we take: the one to freedom and innovation, or the one to government intrusion, expansion and control. It is up to us to make sure we take that freedom road.\n\nPlease help us! Of course, please upvote this post. You can also go to FreeRoss.org for lots of other ways to support our battle. You can donate; play the art game; purchase at our store; volunteer; and spread the word on social media and to your network. Everything helps. We\u2019re just one family and some friends. We need you!",

    "body": "While there are [hundreds]( https://coinmarketcap.com/) of crypto token-based protocols, most have been simple forks of Bitcoin with minor changes to the rules and marketing. [Litecoin]( https://litecoin.org/) and [Dogecoin]( http://dogecoin.com/) are the most well-known examples of copycat protocols with no major technological or economic innovations.\n\nIn the past year or so though, we\u2019ve started to see more protocols that are innovating on tech and economics to enable new use cases.  It's likely that some of these new protocols emerge as the foundational infrastructure for the decentralized web, which will give people control of their lives in ways never thought possible before.  It's also likely that many of these protocols will fail spectacularly.  \n\nhttps://steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/protocols_larger11e16.png\n\nGiven the binary nature of outcomes and potential for spectacular failure, it's important for newcomers to tread cautiously and ask the right questions about new projects. Here are 5 questions that should always be answered before getting involved in a crypto-token based protocol:\n\n# Is the founding team credible and transparent in their approach?\n\nOne might think that if you used this question when evaluating Bitcoin in the early days, you would have missed the opportunity to turn $100 into $72M in 5 years. After all, to this day Satoshi is pseudonymous and no one knows who he is.  \n\nThis thinking is wrong though. The early investors in Bitcoin were part of the cypherpunks email chain and while Satoshi wasn\u2019t known by identity, he was well known by his [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) and his communication on the email chain and in the forums. If you were part of those discussions, you were well equipped in evaluating Satoshi\u2019s credibility. Satoshi was completely transparent in how he launched Bitcoin and he vigorously addressed all questions and concerns about Bitcoin to anyone that asked in the early days.\n\nReading the white paper, and observing how the team shares information is hugely important in the evaluation process. The vast majority of protocols have white papers and Slack groups or forums, so it\u2019s easy for anyone that if you have the time and patience. And if a protocol doesn't have a white paper or  a forum for open communication, you should stay away.\n\n# Is the protocol solving a real problem?\n\nThis is an important question for any crypto investor to consider. Some crypto protocols are attempting to solve clear cut problems ([Monero](https://getmonero.org/home), [Steem](https://steem.io/)). Others aren\u2019t as clear in the problems they\u2019re solving and instead have more general purpose use cases that could make the protocols ultimately bigger in scope (Ethereum, Synereo).\n\n# Is the protocol based on a user token, an equity token, or a debt token?\n\nDemian Brener does a great job describing the difference between the three types of crypto tokens in [this piece](http://www.coindesk.com/tokens-crowdsales-startups/). \n\n* **User tokens** are tokens required to access the protocol the token is based on. Bitcoin and Ether are the most well-known examples of user tokens. User tokens are the most well-established category of crypto token. \n\n* **Equity tokens** are used to fund the development of the protocol, but aren\u2019t necessarily needed to access the protocol. Equity token holders receive two benefits: a percentage of transaction fees from the protocol and voting rights for decisions. The DAO is the most well-known example of an equity token. Given that the most well-known attempt of an equity token was a disaster, this approach is more unproven than the user token approach.\n\n* **Debt tokens** are tokens that represent a loan to the network that earns the token holder interest. The Steem dollar is the most well-known example of a debt token and it\u2019s still very early in the evolution of debt tokens.\n\n# Is the protocol based on fixed token distribution or continuous token distribution?\n\nEvery project has a slightly different approach to token distribution. Fairness of distribution and ease of access to all participants is important for all projects. Additionally, the monetary policy should be considered prior to investment.\n\n* **Fixed token distribution:** A fixed token distribution is a where the entrepreneurs do a fixed issuance of all of the tokens (e.g [Augur]( https://www.augur.net/)). The benefit for investors is that it\u2019s very clear what the outstanding token supply is and it\u2019s easier to value the token. The investor can be sure that there will be no dilution of the token. The downside to this approach is that it makes the token more exclusive and not as accessible to newcomers. This approach looks a lot like a traditional fundraise, and my guess is that fixed token distributions will increasingly be dominated by institutions. As a result, a fixed token distribution may not drive the engagement that a continuous token distribution does.\n\n* **Continuous token distribution:** A continuous token distribution is when the tokens get distributed directly from the blockchain over-time. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the best examples of a continuous token distribution. Some continuously distributed tokens are the result of a fixed token distribution at the onset as well (see Ethereum). The main benefit of a continuous token distribution is that it drives engagement of the protocol. Steem is probably the best example of this to date, as the fact that new creators on Steemit can earn new Steem Power and dollars drives engagement of the protocol.\n\n# Do the economics make sense?\n\nThis is  the toughest of the questions to evaluate. Bitcoin was an economic experiment that most traditional economists, like [Robert Shiller]( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/business/in-search-of-a-stable-electronic-currency.html), said would never work. It\u2019s still working today though and is stronger than ever. \n\nCrypto tokens protocols like Bitcoin are economic experiments have never been tried before and while it\u2019s easy to opine on their success based on theory, often practice defies theory. That said, economic theory can be helpful and one should always be aware of the economics of the crypto token. Many Bitcoin holders believe that the monetary policy of bitcoin is one of its defining characteristics (myself included). My biggest concern about Steem, for example, continues to be the infinite inflation that's built into the monetary policy. \n\n# It's a great time to watch and learn\n\nThe creators of these protocols are paving completely new ground and attempting things that have never attempted before. Even projects that look good based on these questions will fail.  The DAO is a good reminder of that, being the most recent example of  a spectacular failure that measured up well on this analysis. \n\nThe DAO's fatal flaw was a flaw in the code, which only a few of the smartest technical minds in the world could identify. But there are valuable learnings from situations like the DAO disaster. The DAO will lead to more rigorously scrutinized smart contracts in the future and we will be better off for it and failures like the DAO in the future. \n\nI hope that both investors and entrepreneurs alike will think long and hard about these five questions before getting involved in any crypto-token based protocol and take away as many learnings as possible as we go.\n\n___\n\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/7347989cc0.png\n\n* Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NTmoney)\n* Hear about why I'm excited about Steemit [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZknEN-xt6s)",

This book changed my attitude towards investing forever. So I began to take a portion of my paycheck and bought Gold and Silver. Since I was a nurse at the time it was not much but it was enough to make me feel comfortable.\n\nDuring this time I saw people all around me lose fortunes in the subprime crisis in Florida. It was a tragic time. I was working on a psychiatric unit in Tampa where many of our patients were just depressed over losing investments, homes and jobs.\n\nThen the economy and stock market took another dive in September 2008 when Lehman Brothers crashed and burned. My Silver and Gold took a short term hit but I was confident in a rebound especially after the Fed decided to use QE and gimmick programs like Cash for Clunkers to reignite the economy.\n\nDuring this time I moved back to Rochester, NY where with the help of my family we [bought a beautiful century old home](https://www.facebook.com/RandyHilarski/media_set?set=a.129153082024.132022.713277024&type=3) that was in foreclosure for a mere $19,500. It was an awesome house! We remodeled the whole house and I had very low overhead for a few years. \n\n<center>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://photos2.zillowstatic.com/p_h/ISpdz5bseepnx00000000000.jpg</center>\n\nDuring this time Gold and Silver continued to rise. It was exciting for me since I knew I had made a great decision to invest in precious metals.  Then I decided to leave the United States and moved to Panama. I rented the house out for 2 years before selling it for a tidy profit in 2014. I don't like being a landlord!\n\nHere in Panama I handled the marketing for a well known metals investment company. It was 2011 and the metals were on fire. We did over $20 Million in sales that year. Then for no apparent reason Gold and Silver entered a bear market. This bear market lasted until 2016. \n\nI sold a good deal of my bullion in 2014. This money was used to help finance our marketing company. We still have plenty of Silver and some Gold. As far as precious metals we feel that we have enough. \n\nIn 2012 I had my first introduction to Bitcoin. My business partner at the time suggested we take some capital and buy a bunch at $11. I was still clueless about Bitcoin and decided to not do it. IDIOT! I had another opportunity in 2014 as I took profits from my home sale and bought a few BTC. \n\n## [Chart Comparing Gold vs. Bitcoin as Money.](http://www.randyhilarski.com/gold-bitcoin/) ##\n\n<center>http://www.randyhilarski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Randy-Hilarski-Bitcoin-Gold-Silver.jpg</center>\n\nLike many of my fellow newbies I bought into hype and was bitten by FOMO. I invested everything into AuroraCoin. That did not work out to well! I sold when I was down 80% and bought DarkCoin (now Dash). Well that one plunged as well and boom my money was vaporized. So I decided to stay away from Crypto-Currencies since I was not capable of making good trading decisions.\n\nThen in 2015 a friend of mine bought me a position in Bitclub when BTC was around $250. I signed up a few people and quickly made a few BTC which rose nicely in the following months. The spark was lit once again. \n\nAfter a few meetings with Bitcoin pioneers and listening to many videos on the subject of crypto-currencies I knew I was going to be part of this movement for the long term. I personally prefer AltCoins over Bitcoin. Some might scream heresy but I enjoy the excitement of the market. Some days my trading is up multiple BTC other days I am down. The best part is that I get to make the decisions when to buy, sell or hold.\n\nI don't know what is going to happen in the coming months but my guess is that the world will be moving more and more to digital currencies. This bodes well for those of us who are already well versed in the subject.\n\n## More Reasons to Own Gold, Silver and Crypto-Currencies. ##\n\nIf my story has not convinced you to own these assets maybe the current state of the world might. We are in tenuous times. Whenever the world goes to war Gold and Silver are the best assets to own. They protect your wealth as nations squander their wealth on weapons of war.\n\nThe financial system is in a precarious position. We are seeing negative interest rates popping up all over the world. This does not bode well for the saver. Gold and Silver are great options to protect your wealth but Crypto-Currencies like Dash can help you earn money on that wealth. Did you know you can buy 1000 Dash, store them in a Dash Node and earn 1% interest monthly? What bank will pay you 12% annually. Not to mention the possibility that the value of Dash will increase over time.\n\n## Great Interview of Jeff Berwick on the Current State of the Financial System. ##\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ5QYctx02Y\n\n## If You Do Not Take Control of Your Investments You are at the Mercy of the Bankers and Bureaucrats. ##\n\nFor many years we have been taught to let someone else handle our investments. It is time for you and I to take responsibility for our future. Do not rely on government programs to help you in retirement. If you are a believer in the stock market that is great and good luck to you. Personally I am 100% in Gold, Silver bullion and Crypto-Currencies. There is nothing that will change that.\n\n## Keep Stacking Gold, Silver and Accumulating Crypto-Currency! ##",

During this ICO investors are allowed to trade in their BTC, ETH, LSK, any other cryptocurrency accepted by Shapeshift (which has been integrated into the ICO platform) and even fiat currencies (EUR and USD through their exchange) for ICN tokens. These tokens represent a share in the Iconomi OFM platform and it will pay dividends gathered from the revenue generated by user fees on the platform. \n\n85 million ICN tokens out of the 100 million total supply will be sold to investors, while the remaining 15% will be kept by the original development team and be used for bounty campaigns and strategic partnerships. A 15% Bonus is reserved for early ICO investors that decide to buy ICN tokens during the first week of the crowd sale. \n\n\nThe Iconomi OFM platform itself will be built as a smart contract system on the Ethereum Virtual Machine and it will allow users to invest in two types of funds with different risk/profit levels: Coin Traded Funds (CTF) and Coin Managed Funds (CMF). \n\n\nCoin Traded Funds will be managed automatically and according to market scenarios and developments via analytical services that will build a detailed market forecast and manage the funds accordingly. The CTFs are considered to be the less risky option since they are managed based on a set of  predetermined rules and limits. \n\n\nCoin Managed Funds will be manually managed by a team of experienced professionals in the fields of financial analysis, mathematics, and cryptocurrency. Since these funds rely on the expertise of the Iconomi partners they can be considered as the riskier option, which can also mean higher profits. \n\n\nWhile the Iconomi platform does not seem to employ any kind of \"new\" exciting technology, it's an interesting platform with much to offer for new investors that want to get involved with cryptocurrencies and may not have the time to do all the research that is required to set the good from the bad (and there is a lot of \"bad\" in crypto). ICN tokens themselves can also be seen as a decent investment that may become a source of passive income, depending on the platform's adoption. \n\n\nIf you want to invest in Iconomi, you might want to do it fast as there are only 16 hours left until the 15% bonus ends!\n\n**Authored by:**\nAntonio Madeira (@kanoptx)\n\n**Edited by:**\nRicardo Goncalves (@thecryptodrive)\n\n**Links:**\n[https://ico.iconomi.net/](https://ico.iconomi.net/)\n[https://www.iconomi.net/](https://www.iconomi.net/) \n[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1587736.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1587736.0)\n[https://www.iconomi.net/ICONOMI_Whitepaper.pdf](https://www.iconomi.net/ICONOMI_Whitepaper.pdf)\n[https://www.iconomi.net/CoinFundsWhitepaper.pdf](https://www.iconomi.net/CoinFundsWhitepaper.pdf)\n[https://www.cashila.com/](https://www.cashila.com/)",

I unscrewed it from the netbook and plugged it in, uploaded the wallet to blockchain.info and found 0.97 BTC, worth approximately $1,200 at the time. I thought, I guess I'll never see returns like that ever again. Of course I couldn't expect anything close to 12,000% returns, over a few years, more than once in my lifetime. Surely it was just a fluke.\n\nFunnily enough, today I do own 4500 Synereo AMPs, that I bought for $10, which at time of writing are worth around $750. And of course, from my time and effort on Steemit, having got in early in the game, I've certainly been well rewarded. Now, that's interesting. That indicates that, maybe, just maybe, what I experienced was not a fluke - but instead, the start of a new trend.\n\n# Cryptomillionaires and everyday angels\nBitcoin has made a sort of \"angel investing\" available to all of us. We can invest at the launch phase of a coin -even at a point years before the company even has a prouct. People can invest and see profits in the 1000% over a few years. Of course, many of these projects will fail - just as many businesses will fail.\n\n(As an aside, it's unusual that we have the term \"shitcoin\" to deride altcoins, but no parallel term to attack start-ups, though obviously they also fail frequently... I suggest \"fart-butts\").\n\nWhat kind of world will we soon live in, when anyone with the right tools and a small amount of capital can multiply it by 10 or 1000 wihin a few years? What does that say about the future prosperity of humanity?\n\nOf course, there will be bubbles, scams, manipulation, crashes and disappoinments. There will also be thousands or millions of crypto millionaires, who make ridiculous amounts of wealth by discovering new opportunities very early on, and thereby assisting the development team to bring their vision to reality.\n\n# The gentle rich\nWhat will this world of the future look like? Of course, we will have many new, fascinating technologies crowdfunded using cryptocurrency. We will also have this new breed of wealthy, casually exerting influence on economies.\n\nIn my experience, Bitcoiners do tend to be kinder and gentler than the average person  - and that's why Bitcoin naturally appeals to them, because they're seeking a system which isn't controlled by central bankers and fractional reserve bankers, made possible by a violent monopoly on currency. They seek a system which is honest and not supported or in support of violence. Many will even start a Bitcoin pitch with \"here is a technology which may end war\".\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyU3TgQqtV8\n\nSoon, the world might look less like a handful of rich people manipulating governments. It will be thousands or millions exerting their gentle influence - in a more decentralised manner - bringing the benefits of decentralisation to the concentration of wealth.\n\n# About me\n\n[![kurt robinson in the mountains of puebla](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/26/pictureofmecroppedbdb8d.md.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/gsqzK)\n\nMy name is Kurt Robinson.

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Since making my first hesitant little footsteps on the Internet back in 1995, I have watched with interest how this revolutionary technology has impacted upon humanity. I have tried to keep up with it but life has steered me in many directions, taking my attention to other areas, either out of a need for survival, or just boredom at the state of current events. But every time I drifted from a pursuit of furthering my knowledge of all things Internet related I would find something to lure me back. Something to pique my curiosity. My major problem is that I seem to suffer from the disease of dabbling! So I never really allowed my interests to develop beyond the superficial. I never set out for this to be the case. Over the past 12 months I have started to rectify this situation. Taking my interest in computer programming to the next level by actually taking a course in it. Taking a speed reading course so as to take in data and retain it in a useful manner. And attempting to further my knowledge of both Bitcoin and the Blockchain.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s19.postimg.org/gh4q7y5yr/play-stone-1237457_1280.jpg\" width=\"850\" height=\"566\"/></p>\n<h2>The Blockchain Revolution</h2>\n<p>Although I was aware of Bitcoin when it was still in single figures, I never pursued it. Firstly I just didn't get it. Secondly I was broke at the time, so it made no difference. I missed an opportunity, but I missed it on several levels. But what I did gain was a new interest. Bitcoin intrigued me, and the subject kept popping up in my universe, reinforcing the notion that I needed to pursue my studies, and not just superficially, into this new area of technology. But it wasn't until I started to get my head around the technology that went hand in hand with Bitcoin, The Blockchain, that I really started to get it. This is not just \"play money\" as several people tried to tell me. This is a technology that can, and most likely will revolutionise the financial sector. And this is what I started to witness happening.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The concept of the Blockchain appeals to me on many levels. The creation of a decentralised currency, denying any government the ability to inflate the money supply at will was of enormous interest to me. Having been an astute observer of authority and power, and those who pursue it, I haven't failed to notice that in most cases, where there is power there is corruption. And I have never had any interest in seeking to change that corrupt culture from within. I honestly do not believe it is possible. The self interest of the corrupt would not allow for any internal dissent. From my observation the only change that occurs with the authority classes is who has authority. Who has the baton passed to now?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s19.postimg.org/h5dkqw4oj/anarchy-152588_1280_small.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"272\"/></p>\n<p>But I am not a pessimist. I do believe in change. I do believe in the evolutionary process of humanity to better itself. And I believed I was witnessing it first hand in the development and implementation of the Blockchain. As Buckminster Fuller wisely stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cYou never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\u201d</blockquote>\n<h2>Arriving at Planet Steemit</h2>\n<p>Which is what leads me to where I find myself currently: Planet Steemit. I have been here for about 3 weeks, having seen posts on FaceBook discussing it. I was never a huge fan of FaceBook, and used it sparingly, so I do appreciate the irony that the current King of the social media world is what drew my attention to it's potential usurper: Steemit. I started dabbling (that old habit of mine!) in the post making process, and put together some material to share. It never got me very far. Not just financially, but in terms of overall attention. But that's ok. I was more than interested in this new technology. In this marrying of Blockchain technology and social media.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>So I started reading up as much as I could. Trying to see if I could understand how this all worked. Sure I saw some people getting several thousand dollars for their posts. So I tried to understand why. Some brought a ready made audience with them to Steemit. Ok, that makes sense. Others were here from the beginning. Some are just excellent writers and producers of content. But one thing stood out to me: write. Write comments, write posts, communicate. Thumbs up if you like a post or comment. Build a network. So I went to work on it. Slowly, at first. The introvert in me doesn't like sticking his head out too far! But one thing I have found about this site. It has made it far easier to feel comfortable enough to express my thoughts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s19.postimg.org/xrv4zyxmb/abstract-1231868_1280_small.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"282\"/></p>\n<h2>Testing the Waters</h2>\n<p>After having written several posts that expressed some thoughts of mine, I decided to go a bit deeper, and reveal something a little bit more personal. I wrote the following post:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@naquoya/how-cancer-taught-me-happiness\">How Cancer Taught Me Happiness</a></p>\n<p>I received some positive feedback, and it even registered a few cents. I have been writing on the internet, on a casual basis, for many years, and I had just made more than in all those years! It's not about the money, as I'm not going to retire on that anytime soon. It's about observing, and participating in this new phenomenon of a social media platform that actually encourages and rewards social interaction. A platform that rewards content.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Over the next couple of days I wrote and posted two more articles:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/anarchism/@naquoya/sometimes-we-just-need-to-rage-against-the-machine\">Sometimes We Just Need to Rage Against the Machine</a></p>\n<p>and:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@naquoya/mental-slavery-and-the-fear-of-the-unknown\">Mental Slavery and the Fear of the Unknown</a></p>\n<p>and I couldn't believe it when even more people started to read, comment, and like. People were including my work in lists of their daily favourites. This helped me find other content worth reading and exploring, and the network capabilities of this platform started to reveal itself even more. The amount of quality work, and the subjects of interest that I was finding was growing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Steemit Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I felt inspired to write one more article:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/psychology/@naquoya/self-ownership-what-role-do-our-emotions-play\">Self-Ownership: What Role Do Our Emotions Play?</a></p>\n<p>When I woke in the morning, I turned on the computer to catch up on events, and noticed my article showed over $200 next to it. \"What's in my coffee?\" I thought. \"That can't be real can it?\" But it was.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And my excitement for the Steemit platform grew even more. I don't think I will be touching those funds (except to share some with those who have helped me along the way) because if I understand the concept of Steem Power correctly (and I am still learning), it holds great benefit, and the more one has the more voting power one has. And it benefits all of the Steemit universe in the long run. Which is a primary concern of mine. The fact that I was recognised enough to receive that level of financial reward is very gratifying. But ultimately I would like to see Steemit grow and reach it's potential.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>So when it comes to Steemit I wont be dabbling. I intend to learn all I can (having already started), and use this practical experience and network to further my long overdue in-depth understanding of crypto's, the Blockchain, and their potential to revolution this world of ours.</p>\n<h2>Websites That I Have Found Useful On My Steemit Journey</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemstats.com\">https://steemstats.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.chat/home\">https://steemit.chat/home</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://steemtools.com/\">http://steemtools.com/</a></p>\n<p>And for those who wish to understand more behind the Steemit project, the Steem Whitepaper:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steem.io/SteemWhitePaper.pdf\">https://steem.io/SteemWhitePaper.pdf</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

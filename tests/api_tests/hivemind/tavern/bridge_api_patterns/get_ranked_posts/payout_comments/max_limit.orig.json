    "body": "**Amazing Entries** once again this weekend! The talent here on steemit just keeps on growing with each #SteemitPhotoChallenge and I feel it's 100% a direct result of this **trending topic**. So be proud of your work and if you didn't make it into the **Top 3** don't even think about giving up, the computation is tuff and @condra had a difficult time deciding I'm sure.\n\n<hr>\n\n**Honourable Mentions**\n\n @kristylynn I really enjoyed this photo! It reminded me of when I was a kid grabbing dandelions at every change and blowing them all over the place! My father absolutely hated this because they would end up growing all over his lawn. Great work with the depth and the color is very pleasing. Thank you for bring back some old memories.\n\n@minion I tried to capture a very similar shot during my little exploration last sunday morning. I of course failed to get such a crisp, captivating, and **Super Lush** photo if you can describ the vibrant green colors this way. Great job on capturing that moment right before the water droplet escapes the branch , not easy and patience is required. \n\n**Finalist**\n\n@bebecitosfotos This flower is epic! The clarity and brightness is spot on and even the viewed in post and at lower resolution it still comes off as perfectly in focus (always a very difficult thing to do while using Macro). The background is just muted enough to capture a actual backdrop while not taking away fro the foreground image. Excellent work.\n\n@dercoco What can I say about this one... how about **EYES**. I have always loved the reptile eye, Great Work.\n\n@mweich This is spot on! Being able to capture the pollen on the Bee's legs was a great feat I tell you that, while still keeping other expects and depths of the photo in great focus is even harder, very still hand you must have! The angle of the photo and the choice of background imagery defiantly gave this photo an edge when it came to being Macro. The background is often forgot when capturing with Macro even thought it plays such a big role, you seem to have a very good eye for it. And **Congratulations!** on taking First Place!\n\n<hr>\n\nAgain I can't say it enough great job everyone, keep it up!\nCan't wait for next weekend's challenge @jamtaylor make it a good one ;)\n\nBlue",

People who have been involved in crypto for some time are almost instinctively aware of the importance of safeguarding private keys, but \"mainstream\" adopters are accustomed to a world of hand-holding where the powers that be can bail you out if you are careless, stupid, forgetful or unlucky. If a method can be devised to facilitate recovery without sacrificing security, it can avoid problems of negative user experience that could hurt the platform's prospects for widespread adaption.",

I'm glad you're voicing your concerns, but a \"Dan must be stopped\" call to action against the very person who created what we are all enjoying isn't (IMO) the best approach for having a respectful dialogue about the issue. It seems many are already discussing the issue on github and voicing their disapproval there. We'll see where it goes from here, and it's definitely something to keep an eye on. For that, I thank you, but I won't give you my vote on this post because I think the tone is counter productive to a rational, open conversation about the issue. I may be wrong and maybe a more alarmist tone is called for. As with many things, we shall see over time.",

    "body": "> This state of being creates a paradox for those with aims to change the world. If you are at complete peace with the way things are, then what motive is there to change the world? On what basis should you choose to act? This is the very heart of economics, the study of human action. This is the root of my current internal conflict.\n\nMahayana (Great Vehicle) buddhism may have an answer to that apparent conflict you are experiencing. According to the Mahayana tradition, true enlightenment cannot be reached merely by cultivating inner peace and eliminating delusions and suffering in isolation of other people, because doing so remains a selfish endeavor that implies that one hasn't truly reached the state of selflessness that underlies enlightenment. \n\nInstead, at some point along the path to enlightenment, one realizes that one's true nature is that of being conscious: a pure form of benevolent consciousness without shape and boundaries, and that permeates all that is. At that point, one doesn't seek anymore to deliver from suffering that fictious \"ego\" entity that has long been identified as a delusion, but instead seeks to deliver all of consciousness from suffering, including all sentient beings. This intrinsic benevolence of consciousness is what we call \"compassion\", and is the central tenet of Mahayana tradition. It is both the ultimate goal and the mean to reach that goal. By cultivating compassion, one reveals his compassionate nature, and this compassion is what will eventually lead to a contradiction with the ego and materialistic delusions, and their dissolution. \n\nFrom that perspective, he who seeks enlightenment will first accept reality as it is, and reach what first feels as a form of blissful and permanent internal peace (this is typically what Hinayana / Small Vehicule buddhism think is enlightenment, and this includes some famous western self-help authors), but will soon realize that there is one type of suffering that transcends attachment and the delusion of self and that can't be addressed by meditation and spiritual practice alone but on the contrary become more and more sharp: the suffering of seeing others suffering within this reality. This is because suffering is a noble truth, a truth that can't be denied, ignored or accepted but simply acknowledged as being true. This leads to a paradox where embracing reality leads to embracing a form of suffering that can only be eliminated by altering reality which cannot be achieved if one simply embraces reality. The only solution to this apparent paradox is to realize that reality is impermanent and can be embraced while being altered. It should be accepted in the present so that one may live free from delusions and attachment, and reduce suffering to the prime denominator of the quintessential and universally experienced suffering of being alive, while being actively shaped with all one's will and energy into a future reality where other sentient beings suffer less.\n\nUnder the mahayana assumption that consciousness is intrinsically benevolent and unable not to experience compassion as it gets closer to enlightenment, acting with all one's will and energy against the corruption that permeates reality and increases suffering of other sentient beings is not only consistent, but the one and only true way to enlightenment.\n\nArguably, government is one such big chunk of pervasive corruption that has spread like weed in our consensual reality, and creates an inordinate amount of suffering. From that perspective, being anarchist isn't only a political view, it is a statement of compassion. Ask the Dalai Lama what he thinks about governments...",

    "body": "## I strongly oppose the \"5 votes a day\" target. \n\nI thought one of the greatest changes to be implemented so far was when that target INCREASED. People have not been so stressed in the last month or two about curation rewards; they just vote for what they like and have fun. \n\nI don't think Steemit will be FUN anymore if there is an expected target of 5 votes per day. People will spend much less time on the site. They will vote for predictably popular content. And we will be right back where we were a couple of months ago. \n\nNo, it will be worse than that. Because 20 votes a day used to stress people out. 5 votes a day? NO ONE can do any real curation under that scheme.\n\nAs an individual and an established author, the 5 votes a day could be great for me. If we go back to the days when everybody upvoted the same posts, then maybe I'd get all those votes again. I could quit my job and write for Steemit full time. \n\nAnd we'd go back to the days when emerging authors and artists got far fewer votes and rewards. \n\nAs far as curation and voting bots, they are being used for very good purposes also. Rather than turning our tails and running away from them, why don't we use them for the greater good? I think the mega-whales' curation teams are doing a far better job than ever before at redistributing rewards; I make nothing from being involved in that effort, but I think it is working quite well. Give the vote sliders and the voting bots more time; Steemit's front page is finally diversifying and newer people are getting rewards like never before. \n\nOne more thing: Redistribution of Steemit's resources from big whale accounts to the masses MUST be one of our top priorities. How does this help? I understand that big whale accounts may make less on curation rewards, but I think few of them are concerned with this anymore; they're trying to channel their votes to worthy posters. They have recognized that their big stakes will be worth nothing unless we make this thing succeed.\n\nUnder this scheme, the big whales will need to sell the max on exchanges every week and other people buy their Steem for any real redistribution to occur. That will hold down the price and our competitors will zoom right by us. \n\nSteem Team, I understand you are trying to solve real problems with these tweaks. I don't normally comment on them because I feel that Steemit is good enough that there is some margin for error with these back-end decisions. But this is far, far too severe a change for the platform to absorb.\n\n## If I am wrong, then I'd love to hear that from the community, and I am open to learning from other views. Give us time for this discussion, please, before forcing through such a change. Until then, I oppose this change.",

    "body": "1 needs modification, 2 is a good idea\n----\n\nDespite some who call 2 an exit fee, I think Steem Power should stop being marketed as an **\"investment\"** to **\"investors\"**. Market it to users of the platform who want to power up their accounts but make powering up or upgrading a lot easier. Make it possible with a gift card,  fiat, a credit card, or Paypal. People should never see Bitcoin or blockchain anywhere on the Steemit official marketing.\n\nUse gamification to make people want to upgrade their Steem Power. Market Steem Dollars to crypto investors for the 10% interest.\n\nSteem Power a purchasable upgrade for accounts\n-----\n\n>reddit gold is our premium membership program. It grants you access to extra features to improve your reddit experience. It also makes you really quite dapper.\n\nAnd Alice goes to Walgreens with her Visa Card and buys the Steem Card instead of the Netflix card. It's also possible to sell a Steem Power subscription for people who want to buy a little bit at a time, remeber WoW is subscription based and. Second Life has Linden Dollars which are like our Steem Dollars and can be marketed in a similar way.\n\nDo not make the mistake of listening to crypto anarchists or crypto people when it comes to marketing. Crypto people are horrible at marketing and that includes Bitcoin. All of crypto has a bad reputaton and horrible marketing. Look at Pokemon Go or even Reddit Gold to see how to do marketing, or just hire a profesisonal in gamification and marketing guru. Do not listen to Steemit whales and don't even listen to me. Hire people who are from the gaming world, or who marketed popular social networks.\n\n**Note: notice games and social networks never use words like \"investor\" or \"speculator\",  as this would be like trying to market the social network as a gambling site which is something they all avoid.**\n\n**UPDATE: IF ANYONE CAN GET IN CONTACT WITH [Jane McGonigal](https://janemcgonigal.com/) AND HIRE HER AS A CONSULTANT IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR STEEMIT. SHE IS A THOUGHT LEADER IN \"PURPOSE DRIVEN GAMING\" AND HAVING HER ASSOCIATED WITH STEEMIT WOULD BRING MOMENTUM.**\n\nReferences\n1. https://community.secondlife.com/t5/English-Knowledge-Base/Buying-and-selling-Linden-dollars/ta-p/700107\n2. https://www.reddit.com/gold/about/\n3. https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-best-gamification-experts\n4. https://www.linkedin.com/title/gamification-expert",

    "body": "No upvote from me :)\n\nAllow me to explain: \n\na good \"debunking\" takes the claim of evidence, assumes the strongest interpretation of the argument, explains the background behind these ideas and then presents solid counterarguments, evidence to the contrary and sound reasoning. \n\nA gish gallop of links to heavily biased sites such as \"rationalwiki.org\" dismissing whole theories instead of addressing simple claims of evidence openly and honestly does not an argument make. \n\n\"Conspiracy theorists\" will not take you seriously because you do not address their arguments and dismiss you. Most of them will not even bother to click on rationalwiki links simply because all their \"debunkings\" use the same faulty logic and bad and dishonest argumentation. Meanwhile, \"conventional wisdomists\" will pat your back in thanks for reinforcing their beliefs. Nothing has been won this way, quite the contrary, instead of helping those who are maybe just stuck in the wrong loop, you alienate them even further. \n\nI summary, you are doing the scientific method, curious inquiry and intellectually honest open-mindedness a huge disfavor with this sort of post, it can only serve to solidify the beliefs of those who have already formed their opinion and are unwilling to change it. Someone on the fence trying to form an informed and educated opinion will not be swayed either way, because there are hardly any news or arguments in the links that have not already  been addressed and refuted by the peddlers of the conspiracy theories.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a flatearther (although I am sure that in a serious, honest, open and fairly moderated debate, I could show many a rotundist the end of his wisdom) and I know nothing about gold and silver, but the first sentence of the video on **vaccines** was a slap in the face of everyone who has to braincells to rub together and tries to educate himself objectively and honestly. \n\n\"**There is no debate to have:** Vaccines don't cause autism and save millions of lives per year.\" Wow, much argument, so convince! And then it continues with cheap appeals to authority, misrepresentations and distortions of the actual arguments of antivaccine activists and to psychopathologize all those whose lifes took a turn for the worse just hours after they received their oh so healthy shots. I call it \"coincidience theorizing\". \n\nMy intentions are sometimes misunderstood, so let me clarify: I am not here to fight you, or to defend any particular theory. I am here to help you make a better argument to achieve your stated goal to dispel myths and misconceptions with the scientific method: \n\n> it is impoartant that we try to keep each other informed and educated, as much as possible, and in sustainable way. By keeping ourselves scientifically literate we directly improve the quality of life of all others in our society (and humanity as a whole).\n\nI agree with that. But then you continue to call everything that is not \"received wisdom\" \"bullshit\", \"quack\" and \"crap\"; that is as if I had begun my post by calling you a sheeple!\n\n I am sure you can do better, [here is some inspiration](https://steemit.com/flatearth/@akareyon/how-to-refute-a-claim-of-evidence-for-a-conspiracy-theory-case-study-a-perspective-on-flat-earth) :)",

So there would be several layers of derivatives where investors were tremendously exposed to low grade debt that was certified as high grade.\n\nIt is similar to walking into a casino and being told your odds of winning are 99 of 100, but in reality they are 1 of 100, and much of the economy is predicated on the accuracy of the risk estimates, which were not only wrong but generally lies.\n\nTo even bring the borrower into the equation completely absolves everyone who sold or certified derivatives that they knew were toxic.\n\nThe narrative that brings this question into our consciousness is part of a larger theme that attempts to blame low income people for society's problems.",

    "body": "Both proposals will *reduce* and not increase the demand for steem. First, divesting already has a 2 year time schedule. If you make vests worthless during those two years by taking away their power to earn any curation rewards, then there will be much less incentive to actually own vests. Committing vests for 2 years already places a huge drag on demand. Completely neutering vests for 2 years will do even more damage.\n\nSecond, by having a voting pool that includes steemits vests, you reduce the value of all other vests. The incentive will be to power down, lose your voting rewards, then get a real identity and leverage steemit's vests instead.\n\nThe combination of these two proposals is to scrap any incentive to own vests becasue (1) they will be worthless as capital while powering down and (2) they will be unable to compete with steemit's vests when not powering down.",

Till now.\n\nI'm super keen, I'll do everything I can to get there and I love that you guys are working to cut costs but even after discounts I would probably be looking at a pretty big cost (more then I've ever made from steem, even if we fastforward the 2yr withdrawal delay)..\n\nHowever.. I'm here for the long term, money isn't my primary goal, and the networking opportunity would be priceless. Fingers crosssed I'll be seeing you all there !",

    "body": "Good job gathering statistics.  I would like to point out some extra facts for those concerned about the fall in diversity of miners.\n\n## 50+ Runner Up Witnesses \n\nIn addition to the top 19 witnesses, there are over 50 accounts that produce blocks at least once per day if not many times per hour.  Combine this with the top 19 witnesses and the top two miners and you get over 70 unique individuals producing blocks on a daily basis.   \n\nTo put this in perspective, there can be at most 144 unique individuals producing blocks on a daily basis with Bitcoin.   In any given hour only 6 unique individuals produce and validate Bitcoin blocks, whereas Steem has at least 30+ unique individuals per hour (maybe much more, I didn't actually count).  \n\nThe numbers 144 and 6 are assuming all blocks are produced by *different people*, but in reality only 9 unique individuals (pools) confirm blocks each day.  In any given hour less than 5 people confirm blocks because some pools get lucky and produce twice in the same hour.  Imagine rolling a 9 sided die 6 times, [the probability that a given hour will have the same pool selected twice is 90%](https://lazycackle.com/birthday-problem-calculator.html).\n\n## Purpose of Proof of Work \n\nThe purpose of Proof of Work is to make the blockchain computationally expensive to forge.  Regardless of how many unique individuals are mining, we know that a certain number of calculations must be performed for a given proof of work threshold.  \n\nSomeone who implements a GPU algorithm is able to perform these calculations more cheaply than someone with a CPU.  This increases their profit margins.   The market always responds when someone is earning guaranteed oversized profits.  Right now the proof of work is rewarding those who did the *programing work* necessary to increase computations.  \n\n## Transactions as Proof of Stake \n\nEvery user who uses the blockchain is also participating in directly confirming the current blockchain state.  Each transaction includes the block ID of a recent block. A forged chain would be unable to migrate all of the user activity and therefore is easily identifiable by simply looking at the stake-weighted average time since each account last transacted.  \n\nSteem is secure, the market for computational power is functioning, things will evolve just as they did with Bitcoin.  One day there may even be ASIC miners.",

    "body": "I don't agree with the minimum price formula. That means if all SD in existence right now except for 1 SD was collected into one account and then converted to STEEM with a single conversion request, that 1 remaining SD would likely be able to claim  13503 STEEM (which at current prices is worth approximately $19,444 USD) through a later conversion. Now obviously, that is a ridiculous example, but it demonstrates how a sudden large decrease in SD supply due to conversions, can cause later converters to get a lot more STEEM than they should due to that minimum rule, even if the  price of STEEM in USD doesn't change.\n\nThere is no need for the minimum price. If the USD hyperinflates (which I disagree with you regarding it being more likely than the other type of black swan), then the witnesses could just transition to tracking the price of some other asset with reasonably stable value. For example, the witnesses could instead track the price of some other currency, or if necessary maybe even the price of gold. An appropriate factor would be included into the definition of the price being tracked so that there isn't a discontinuous change in the SD/STEEM feed price during the switch over from tracking USD to some other asset. \n\nThe social contract regarding the price feed should not be to track USD, but rather to track an asset with relatively stable purchasing power that has a well-defined computable price relative to STEEM, whichever the best asset for satisfying those conditions is at the time. Obviously, we would also want to avoid switching the assets we track unless it is truly necessary to satisfy that social contract. And the decision to switch and the particular asset to track instead should only be made after extensive community discussion (and enough time for stakeholders to reflect their views through witness vote changes) which includes the opinions of both relevant parties: SD holders and STEEM/SP holders.",

It's not that I don't trust you, it's that **I don't trust anyone with my active key**. I'd still like to be able to use services like these though. \n\nMaybe we could kick off a discussion to allow the `posting` key to update our profile information, even if to start it's just the json_metadata field? \n\nEither way, I love how this is progressing.

    "body": "I think I understand more about this now. It's easy to see this commit as an abuse of power, but I don't think that's dan's intention.\n\n# Clarification of the commit\n\nFlagging a post is currently the only way to counteract \"bad\" voting. When posts achieve an excessively high reward it gets downvoted because people think the reward is too high.\n\nThis has a couple of negative effects:\n\n* It gives the message that the post is bad when in fact the downvoter just thinks the voting is bad;\n* It affects the reputation of the poster even though the downvoter might not have a problem with that person.\n\nThe commit adds the possibility to downvote a vote instead of a post. Users that don't agree with how someone is voting will be able to negatively impact the voter (with whom they disagree with) without affecting the poster.\n\nLogically speaking, this makes sense: make it clear what we're saying when we vote.\n\n# Possible motivation\n\nYou might be inclined to think that the motivation is to make the separation between downvoting posts and downvoting votes clearer. Whilst that might be true, the post [negative voting and steem](https://steemit.com/steem/@dantheman/negative-voting-and-steem) by @dan focuses a lot on whales and bots. Whilst I'm only speculating now, I think there's a lot more to this than meets the eye:\n\n>The abusive whale up voter is not only gaining profits, but denying others the opportunity to earn profits by forcing them to use down votes.\n\nI think @dan is going after other whales. In particular, he's going after whales that use bots:\n\n>This type of behavior is when a whale creates a bot that simply up votes everything from reputable users regardless of quality. This kind of behavior can be countered by other whales only by pushing the author rewards toward 0.\n\nI think @dan is trying to protect steem from whales that are abusing their power to earn high rewards by giving altruistic whales a better way to punish the abusive whales without affecting post authors.",

    "body": "There is one more important fact that people miss that justifies why Steemit Inc has mined a substantial amount of STEEM in the beginning.\n\nDue to the rate-limitation that allows free transfers on the Steem blockchain, all **new accounts** need to be **pre-funded** with a couple dollars worth of Steem Power. That means that creating an account is among the few transactions that **actually cost a fee**. So, Steemit Inc **needs** these funds to be able to onboard new users! So far, the Steem network knows 74,241 accounts with probably +80% having been registered by Steemit.\nLet's assume the account creation fee was at 3 STEEM per account from the beginning (and it was not), then that would amount to  178,178 STEEM or more than a quarter million dollars. All payed by Steemit Inc.\n\n@charlieshrem: Since you seem very open-minded about Steem and think that you can help the whole ecosystem to grow one or the other way, I would like to offer you to call me on skype or appear.in so that I can help you understand the details that are still unclear. Only if you like, of course.",

    "body": "@heiditravels: Welcome to my world. I am sorry this happened to you, but I am glad you stood up and cleared the air.\n\nThank you for defending me too. I am very glad to read your post as I suspected something fishy about @fyrstikken after he lied about me \"giving financial advice\". I never gave any single person financial advice to invest in Synereo. He confused the solutions i presented (one for addressing harassment and abuse (duh!) and the other for addressing centralized power), with offering advice to invest. I never told anyone to do anything with their money. I am an artist and writer, not an investor. So, when he began spreading lies about me, I just couldn't believe it since I considered us to be friends. I was shocked actually. And of course hurt. The reason I didn't create a post yet about it, is because, quite frankly, his insane behavior points to an unstable mind. \n\nI was taken aback by his calling you a 'cunt' multiple times, and also all the sexually violent talk. That just showed me exactly who **he** is. He is definitely not who I thought he was. Thank you for clearing this up, because it has been weighing on my mind how to approach this issue. My natural tendency is to withdraw from such nutjobs, who are both powerful, rich and have followers and also who have it out to get people (note death threats aimed at Tuck).  \n\nI was very disturbed that he was spreading misinformation about me when I did nothing to him personally. I see that he was angry because I was bringing up flaws of steemit, ones that I want to be fixed before things get out of hand.(Like they are now).\n\nAnd another thing I will just clear up with this. The reason I made that Synereo post so controversial is because I could not stand the fact that one user was continuing to be harassed. To ignore the most vulnerable people in society is to be the worst kind of human. \n\nThe misogyny in here is exactly as I described it. I have been noticing, and absorbing other people's pain for far too long. I wrote that post because I cannot stand to see people suffer. I am not going to be happy in a place that ignores suffering. I wrote it mainly for others, as well as my future safety. Not having a block feature is simply absurd at this stage of the game. (And yes, I realize that the blockchain will contain all data. I realized that in my first week of being on Steemit. I am only referring to the application known as Steemit having the filter or block feature.)\n\nMy only regret is that because of my anger in the devs not taking this issue seriously, I used part of that email from Dan. That was wrong of me to do so and I have already apologized to him. I know when I have gone too far, because I feel bad about it. I did make a mistake in quoting that email and I want to apologize to him and also to all the newbies who were negatively affected. \n But the rest of it stands. I am not a puppet and I will always seek the truth over everything else. I cannot be bought off, and no one owns me. You can tell a lot about a society with the way they treat the most vulnerable members.\n\nThis new thing of @fyrstikken lying now about 2 women and calling us 'cunts' is the exact reason that women have already started fleeing. I am glad all this came to light because it has been in the shadows, happening to women, gays and other marginalized people. I know, because they tell me. \n\nThanks for your comments, and for clearing up what i suspected already, @fyrstikken is a wolf in sheep's clothing, someone with a giant ego and an explosive, violent temper. He has destroyed any trust I had for him previously. And I also have evidence that there are many others, both within Steemit and outside of Steemit who have been misled and manipulated by him.\n\nI waited a long time to respond because, like everyone else, I wanted to believe in that jovial, Norweigan image. I had to collect research, data, from sources. I have enough data to make a firm conclusion.\nI had even written a long story about Steemit weeks ago with him as a character in it. I see now that I have to remove his character because it is not representative of the real person. I think what really sucks about all of this is that I really love that SHITCOIN YouTube video he did. And I guess I will continue to like that video, even though the person who made it tried to ruin my reputation in Steemit. well I believe I still have the highest reputation in here. Numbers are more trustworthy than words. When I am wrong, at least I admit it. Now, it's someone else's turn. People need to come clean and admit they were wrong. \n\nNo human being is right 100% of the time. We are not robots. We are in constant evolution. However, I do not spread lies about others. In fact, I am naive about people and I tend to see the good in others, even when I shouldn't. \n\nIt takes a lot for me to see the bad in people and publicly come forth and reveal that. It feels wrong to write about others (that's why I apologized when I wrote about the email). That is the reason I know fyrstikken is misguided. For him to fly off the handle and make public accusations based on a vague conversation, and try to ruin @heiditravels is enough to make me steer clear of him altogether.\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/OKXQYY6SQsw1y.gif",

    "body": "As a native Russian I can't say that I agree with everything that our government is doing, as more or less people live good mostly in big cities (Moscow, st. Petersburg) that accumulate all the money. If you would go 150 km away from Moscow you'll be probably surprised how live people of the most resource-rich country. The average pension is $120-150, the average salary in the provinces is $250-300. \nEven my scholarship, as of Ph.D. student of the best Russian university, is $ 110 per month. (My average post at Steemit made more :D).\n\nBut you'll be really surprised how adaptive Russian people are. They passed through the Great Patriotic War and they will not cry, if there'll be no money or there is something wrong, but rather they'll stock up on firewood, grow up potatoes and vegetables in the garden (that they will obviously preserve and stock up too). Basically, people in the provinces lives by the fact that ground is feeding them\n\nThe problem is that In Russia we have the same issue as Steemit has. 80%+ of all national funds are owned by ~50 people. \n\nDespite everything aforementioned I support Putin in his intentions to defence country, as he is pretty smart and strong guy who can use its power wisely. And all these modern nuclear missiles and air defense systems are **defence**, not attacking.  And as one of the commenters said, Russian doctrine is defensive but not offensive!\n\nI'm sorry if I wrote something that goes beyond the topic",

    "body": "While as an author, I publish my content for the love of publishing and writing, I would LOVE to receive more interactions from people. I know that I am not some low-grade author, and I know that I have many interesting topics to cover, but there just isn't much interaction. The money aspect is really great, but its a bonus to me where I seek to enliven people's days with a great poem or story, or to enrich their thoughts with knowledge and to hear feedback in the form of questions and criticism. I've noticed that with just upvoting creating the rewards (if your comments get upvotes you get rewards too) it tends to have many people just upvoting and not even reading. Any ideas on how to eliminate that and create a community that is more involved with itself? I know that some authors, like yourself, receive much interaction - but its also because of how much their posts are making giving people incentive to post \"Great article, thanks!\" while receiving some legitimate input from interested readers, but largely I do not see that happening - perhaps its just my perspective, its my experience certainly.",

    "body": "I understand your critique of a gendered term and that there are huge issues surrounding gender equality.  In this case, I was responding to someone who specifically stated that she \"wasn't a feminist\" (in bold) in a post talking about women in the tech industry and thought the term \"feminist\" would be appropriate in my response for her.  \n\nThere is much intersectionality of other gender equality, race, class, and social issues.  I'm a woman in tech.  I wrote about feminism specifically because it's something that I feel needs specific attention and it's relevant to me.  I was also directly responding to someone who was saying she wasn't a feminist.  She's actually making a positive assertion, disguised as a negation.  So actually in your example: \n\n>Imagine the same thing with the term \"white supremacy\" and a complaint about how the racists are ruining the term\n\nIt would actually be \"white supremacy\" and a complaint about the people who say they're not white supremacists.\n\nI believe in equality.  I'm a feminist,  gender-equalist, LGBTQ ally.  All those issues have issues specific to them, and a lot of them have issues that intersect.  \n\nMy post is a woman speaking to another woman about being a woman in tech--to unite each other.  The term feminist is perfectly acceptable.  \n\nIf you want to start a fight about terms, go elsewhere.",

I, too want to solve the conditions which led to his death.  This is a systemic problem, and I hope that we're good enough to solve it.  Personally, I don't think that prohibition ever will.

I try to support content that is going to pull in a wide audience. That's what we need here.\n\nAlso, look at the voting pattern. Other whales and some known bots are simply early voting me. I am voting very late on almost all posts these days so that no one accuses me of voting for curation rewards. I'm voting for authors almost exclusively. I am also doing all manual voting even though I am voting with about 50 accounts, one of which is @itsascam, in case people are curious why its votes correlate so highly with @steemed.\n\nThe rational response for minnows is not to get jealous of successful authors and waste a lot of time complaining. The rational response is to simply get an alert that tells you when my author list posts and then vote earlier than me and you will earn vesting rewards.\n\nAnd for the moral high grounders out there, this is a decentralized system so no matter how you engineer it, there will be market inefficiencies until an equilibrium is reached. If you don't like unusually high payouts, then write a big scandalous post about how the constant influx of new rules create a constant state of disequilibrium.\n\nAdvisement: as new rules are implemented, new disequilibria arise, and *smart* people will find ways to capitalize on those disequilibria. Instead of complaining about free market actors, complain about the rule makers. I know that falls on deaf ears, but at least I said it. Remember: they are whales for a reason.",

The \"Promote\" button, bounties, internal transfers of any kind really - they can all work to redistribute influence and none of them involve dumping Steem\n\nOkay, in that case I agree with you. Perhaps you are not aware that redistribute in this manner thousands of Steem per week on ongoing and one-time sponsorships, bounties and other initiatives, along with spending within the system on all sorts of things, including hiring people and powering up their accounts every week. As I said elsewhere in this thread, I have also _powered up_ tens of thousands of Steem.\n\nIn all seriousness, I think people should focus on trying to improve the fundamenal appeal of the system and demand to investors and less on what whales are doing because first of all you can't control it anyway (even if you have influence over a few involved whales like myself, you have no influence at all over a good number of whales who are not personally involved) and second of all, it is very difficult if not impossible to see the whole picture. \n\nAlready we have had one of the core developers ignorantly insulting a whale and stating that his curation is worthless even though that whale is heavily involved with one of the best curation initiatives and also people making claims about how much I am selling \"week after week\" which are simply false (and not really anyone's business anyway -- I'm an independent investor here making decisions about _my own money_, not a team insider).\n\nNone of this is helpful in any way, and just creates more division and hostility in the community when we can accomplish a whole lot more by working together. Let's put a stop to it.",

We are working around the clock to move this website forward.\n\nTo give context to this situation, Dan responded to you personally, even offering that we would look into the identity of the offender and disclose that information law permitting, and the entire message thread considered, it appears your quotes are taken out of context.  Dan was only trying to help when he asked if you had responded to him.\n\nAs far as moving this platform forward, we are actively engaging in creative problem solving to improve the economics of post and curation rewards as well as turn Steemit from a blockchain-site into a thriving and personalized social media site.  More on that soon.\n\nAs far as comparisons to Synereo and other blockchain-based platforms for social networking, I would like to see more comparisons of the economics at the protocol and rewards levels.

    "body": "I think monogamy has value, particularly for providing a stable environment for raising children, but I've also begun to think it's overrated as well.\n\nOne thing I find incredibly interesting is seeing what the bible has to say on the subject, since that's widely believed to be the source of the moral outrage at non-monogamy. As it turns out, the bible says remarkably little about it, and never explicitly states that monogamy is the only moral sexual relationship.\n\nIn fact, I am confident that the bible does *not* say that sex is only legitimate within the bounds of marriage (though I'm sure modern christians will label me a heretic for saying as much). It does condemn adultery, which makes sense: one should honor his commitments; it points out that there is a proper time and a place for sex, and abusing it is unhealthy...\n\nIn 1 Corinthians, Paul argues for monogamy, but the attitude of this passage is not one of laying out basic moral law, but rather one of a wise mentor advocating restraint to a specific audience in a specific situation. I could elaborate further, but the long and short of it is that most of what modern christianity teaches about sexual morality is on shaky biblical footing at best; I personally think polyamory is within the bounds of biblical morality.\n\nI realize that most people don't care about biblical morality, but the bible has a lot of good advice, and I think it warrants some consideration even if you don't accept it as axiomatically true (which I do not) as most modern christians do.",

    "body": "I think what @joelkatz and others think is going on is called a [Motte-and-Bailey](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/09/motte-and-bailey-doctrines/) argument. A term is given two meanings; one innocuous and defensible, and another that is more provocative. When the doctrine is attacked, advocates lean on the more innocuous meaning, but otherwise the more provocative meaning is used. In this example, feminism might be defended as \"equality among the sexes\" but when the battle dies down, the meaning \"preferential treatment for women\" or \"inferior treatment for men\" would be used.\n\nI'm not sure this is *really* happening much with feminism, but I can think of other examples. Religious 'faith' can have unobjectionable meanings like sticking to a consistent of moral principles over time, but also can mean uncritical acceptance of miraculous claims (healing people by laying on hands, etc). Depending who you talk to and in what circumstance, you get a different definition (or a more vague definition). The insidious thing about it is that when you have bought into an ideology, it can feel much like both definitions are identical.",

    "body": "Great interview Jeff.  \n\nI think a point of confusion might have been around the proof of stake(PoS) aspect of mining.  I believe Tone may be thinking that Steem's PoS is like traditional \"stake mining\" as you find in other PoS coins.  Steem is actually a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).   \n\nIn traditional \"stake mining\" your mining rewards are based on the amount of stake you hold.  So the larger stake holders(insiders) would earn more then anyone else.  This seemed to be a primary point of concern for him.  However, in DPoS the amount of stake you hold simply determines the weight of your vote for who you think should receive the mining rewards. (Top 20 Witnesses in this case)  Having a large stake doesn't actually pay you anything.  All SP holders are inflated at the exact same % rate and as you stated, the Steem supply is 100% inflated each year such that the value of your SP remains the same.",

Hurting someones feelings and lying is a double edged sword. I suggest people realize that attacking men is no better than attacking women. Adding \"women\" instead of people just makes you seem to onlookers to be covering one side (and they will all assume what your motivations are). \n\nFyrst and you are both charming hotheads.  That is all there is to say about it for me.  I do thank you for bringing the threats up though. Heidis experience was the only one i had seen on here that was bad from fyrst and i assumed it was just one incident and that there wasnt a history of this stuff on other boards. I thank the tuck team for this.  At least one of the tuck team, though, really needs to chill out sometimes.",

    "body": "Dear Richard,\n\nWow. That took some serious guts to write. I commend you for your honesty and I thank you for thinking about me in the context of what you see as a solution. I believe that @donkeypong would be an excellent choice in that role.\n\nI have also been experiencing the same things you mentioned with regards to the cognitive dissonance. It suddenly dawned upon me last month that Steemit was not created by artists/writers/curators who would instinctively know what needed to be done for future artists/writers/curators. We have a very detail-oriented programmer/visionary and an ex-private equity fund manager who knows a great deal about finance and markets. Steemit is an excellent bank and I greatly appreciate the blockchain and all the technical aspects of its construction. I also feel indebted to this site because it rewarded me for my writing, in a way that no other client has ever rewarded me for. Like all things, however, now, I do feel that I am not able to speak my mind, for fear of backlash and flagging. I did not see this coming.\nI agree with your assessment that there seems to be a lack of emotional intelligence and an inability to listen, take feedback and then turn that feedback into action. This kind of thing does require a certain kind of personality and it also requires life experience and maturity.\n\nI see the primary issue as a tug of war between attempting to create a decentralized, transparent system and a centralized chain of command. By posting as individuals on Steemit and letting the community comment freely, it gives the illusion of a decentralized system. However, when an unpopular hardfork goes into effect, despite the fact that many prominent members, @donkeypong being the most visible voice, it gives rise to a pause. I don't think anyone really knows or understands why the vote count is going to be changed to 5 instead of 40. In my mind, a reduction of votes equals a sort of constriction effect, like a boa constrictor wrapping itself around my neck, which leads to a sort of rationing of energy which leads to stress, which leads to me wanting to get off Steemit in order to reduce the stress levels. And, no, I still don't understand what the restriction of votes mean. I read a bunch of posts and rebuttals, but to be honest, even I don't understand why it was changed. I doubt that many people even have the foggiest idea. Perhaps in theory it is a good idea, but to an artist, with a visually-enhanced imagination, I equate fewer votes with a scarcity mindset. An abundance mindset would mean that people would not have restrictions and would be encouraged to love the posts on steemit so much that they could vote to their heart's content. This is the cognitive dissonance that Richard is describing so well. \nWhen you have Vulcans (And I use Vulcans in a good way, as Spock is one of my favorite characters) making rules for regular people, it turns out that the regular people don't really understand the rules at all, and continue playing their own game in spite of the rules, because they were never made for them in the first place. Vulcans just need to be balanced by regular people, that is what I meant to add. \nI guess if I ran this place, I would send a huge apology to Richard. And then I would thank him for opening my eyes to the truth. Then I'd sit down, get several drinks ready and just sort of soak in everything that has gone down so far, while continuing to sip my drinks. I'd start listening to the people who are the power users and I'd really start reading everything that minnows are complaining about. I'd take several days off the regular grind, and dive into solving the issues for the users, because I'd realize that the users will either make or break my future. I'd start with reading every response from [The Steemit User Survey](https://steemit.com/steemit/@stellabelle/steemit-user-survey-results-part-1) because I would realize that the answers to the problems lie inside there. Then, I'd build my own surveys, in an attempt to collect more data on how to improve Steemit. I'd respond to the data and make changes based on what I found, not on preconceived notions of how I wanted to change it. \nI guess that is what I would do. I would not give up, but I would not continue down the same path either. I would become more like water, less like rock. I would realize that I would still be in the running to alter the course of history. That is why I'd change.",

    "body": "I'm sorry but the real problem with a post like this is it's pandering to one of the main crimes of the mainstream media. It's called Outrage Marketing. The idea is you try and whip up a frenzy of emotion in order to a) sell more newspapers or b) get more views/votes on Steemit. The post could just as easily be framed as a question, as in 'why's @dan doing this?\n\nNow that might not engender such a large response, but at least it would be the start of a civilised discussion, rather than a pile-on. \n\nNow I apologise profusely if that was not your intention, but from where I'm sitting that's really what it looks like. \n\nTo me one of the most poignant parts of this discussion is the fact that it demonstrates just how fragile our concepts of 'trust' are nowadays. Someone has taken time and effort to create something which he believes is/will be of value to the world, and releases is to early acclaim. But then, immediately he tries to polish/improve, it's considered to be a threat or an attack. At this time an imaginary threat at that. \n\nSo what is the threat?  That @dan or someone else will use the new power to 'completely void the voting capability of other users'. Is that really true? And if so, would he use it to ruin the community spirit or to try and improve the quality of the platform in some way? I don't understand why he would do it for the former, rather than the latter.\n\nAnyway, the arguments can rage back and forth ad nauseum, but I would suggest that we try and maintain a credo that has served our civilisation well for a long time. \n\n\"A person is considered innocent, until proven guilty\".\n\nPeace out!",

    "body": "I have read all the comments here to this post and feel compelled to add my reaction and opinions to what has been posted already.\nIt is most interesting to look at the posts from an analytical point of view.\nFirst, there are way too many people who see this as an entertaining piece rather than a totally unacceptable event that should not exist on the platform. Yes, it is supposed to be censorship free, however, that should not be used as an excuse for extreme abuse and harassment.\nSecond, we have two people here who have clearly demonstrated through their posts over time that they are reasonable, mature, and personable individuals so why the comments suggesting that this is a case of \"he said, she said\"?\nThere should not be any question about that even if all one has as evidence is the information put forward in this post.\nThird, in my opinion, this is definitely both a Steemit issue AND an incident of abuse and harassment that must be taken seriously and acted upon in a decisive and constructive manner.\nThis is not a \"problem for Dan to deal with\". It is a problem that falls squarely on the shoulders of all who are a part of the community and it is our aggregate responsibility to condemn unacceptable behavior in no uncertain terms and demonstrate the fact that abuse and harassment on the Steemit platform should and will not be tolerated.\nRegardless of how incredible the technology, innovative infrastructure, and financial potential Steemit provides, the whole project will fail miserably if the community does not take concrete and immediate steps to deal with and prevent abuse and harassment on the platform.",

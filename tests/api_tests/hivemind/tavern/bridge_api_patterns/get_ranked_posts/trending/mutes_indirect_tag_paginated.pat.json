    "body": "<center>https://s16.postimg.org/5csp5ocf9/kevv.jpg</center>\n\nHere I am spending the night in the darkness of my bedroom. Dog's snoring right beside me, his head resting on my chest. Feeling like I'm in some prologue of a cyberpunk story. Anyway, surfing on Steemit mobile is actually quite decent, despite the inadequacy of certain types of tables and media not showing up properly on screen.\n\nDecided to write this after going through some dramatic commentaries on Steemit that happened for the past few days. Mostly about ideological disagreements, and especially, overcompensation of posts. While I consider myself pretty critical, I usually opt out of direct, in-your-face type of confrontations. I prefer to plan and pick my own battles, having learned out of experience.\n\nBecause personally, I've never come across any situation that immediately improves itself after insults are thrown around. No one is going to admit wrong right away. Everyone's always right in their own world, and that's particularly true with the presence of an opposing voice. And it doesn't matter how zen one may be. No one's a perfect saint. Everyone has a breaking point. \n\nYup, I've snapped before, more than enough times to know this little fact of life. Nothing good comes out of throwing a fit (well not as much as can be). Sure, our message, our version of truth should be upheld. But there are better ways of fighting the good fight.. maybe like what I'm trying to do with this post right now. So what am I trying to address here?\n\n---------------------------\n# Plan your battles - don't join someone else's!\n<center>https://s10.postimg.org/ntels66d5/planning.jpg</center>\nThere was [a post on Steemit](https://steemit.com/anarchy/@kennyskitchen/the-40-anarchists-you-want-to-be-following-on-steemit) a while ago that labelled me an anarchist. Am I? Maybe I am. Sure, I'm against big, centralised governments. I may even detest the inherent thieving practices of big brother. But I'm still running a music event company - there are legal matters that I still need to run by government offices, purely out of safety and security reasons.\n\nYou may argue that it's perverted that I'm using an intrinsically violent agent (namely, The Government and The Police State) to secure the well-being of my business customers. Next I'll ask - can we have a decentralised free market doing music events with all the right securities? That's what my company, [Hybrid Entertainment](https://steemit.com/steemit-marketing/@kevinwong/our-next-dance-music-event-psychedelic-trance-some-steemit-love) partly aims to do. It's a learning process. \n\nFor now, we still need to use the existing structures of Old, Big Government.. while we find ways to transition out of such dependence. Fight too hard and you'll get clamped down, thrown out of the game. You can't do much when you're out of the game, so stay in it! Take the time to plan your battles, dear hot-blooded confrontationists (if that's even a word).\n\nSure, the world needs you to say things as they are. But hearing the painful truth is almost like violence itself. No one likes that, no matter which side of a dispute. Peace also involves peace of mind. It's a much longer game - it comes with the territory. You're already in someone else's fight once you get into war. Only get into war if you're the big guy. The small guy is always the loser - the unwilling pawn. Think about this in scope of what's happening all around the world, even on Steemit.\n\nDon't be a zealot. There are dangers of being too far left, or too far right. Find the middle way. All you need is another perspective. Some people may be asswipes, but goodness is omnipresent if the conditions are right.\n\nAnd that's how you plan your battles - take the time to do it right. \n\nIn perspective of my generally apolitical position on Steemit, I tend to find better ways to contribute instead of lashing out on another user. Sure, I have my dissatisfaction about some author rewards and posting models from time to time. However, I tried putting effort into building better models and figuring out ways to add substantial value into the ecosystem. Eventually, some of us gravitated towards a loose goal of rewarding diversity by combing contents on Steemit on a daily basis.\n\nThere are now epic giant hidden-gem megaposts on Steemit - like this one from [Project Curie](https://steemit.com/@curie) and [Robinhood Whale](https://steemit.com/@robinhoodwhale). Better coverage, better quality, better value - in so many ways. This is the free-market reaction to solo authored hidden-gem posts of early Steemit. No doubt that everything evolves over time. \n\nKnowing that value is subjective, I have always refrained from losing my cool. Even here on Steemit. \n\n**I'm the small fish and I have to plan my battles!**\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n# Don't freaking milk it!\n\n<center>https://s3.postimg.org/6ne6t272b/milk.jpg</center>\nThere are big reasons why most of us don't really like governments. Greed and corruption. Needless to say, the crowd easily picks up on this when insubstantial effort is rewarded handsomely. By all means, that's as subjective as can be. What's not (very) subjective, however, is if one continues to milk it, even despite public disapproval. \n\nThis happens all around the world. Don't oversell. You'll lose reputation if you are obviously **milking it**!\n\nSure, you may gain new followers.. newly inspired and freshly impressed. But old eyes grow weary. People are watching, and your social value fluctuates all the time. You can't please everyone, but you can try the **art of not milking the shit out of the system**.\n\nIt's a good business practice. It's a good personal conduct. And it works on Steemit.\n\nThat's a reason why I'm also posting lesser (other than plainly having a huge writer's block, reserving myself from random shitposting). Now I'm only writing when I really think I have something good to add as a post. As I'm partly dependent on Steemit, I've strategized a lil, refraining from appearing to be **milking it**, seeking modes of substantial contribution behind the scenes to compensate for the awesome support that has been given to me on this platform.\n\nIf you are suddenly rewarded thousands for a post - ask yourself. Is that post worth that much? Heck, I don't know if my top philosophical post is worth 4,000 bucks, but I know I've put long hours in it, enough to avoid milking and recycling the same content. Instead, I try to put more effort in other areas of the ecosystem to balance out the lopsided reward.\n\nThe blockchain is transparent. It's easy to find out if you're milking it. To avoid seeming like you're milking it - just be honest and ask yourself the right questions! Then, do the right thing!\n\n**Like life, like Steemit - try to give more than you can take. Don't. Freaking. Milk It.**\n\n----------------------------------\n\n# Take time to build, or take time to exploit?\n<center>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/T9b4dDQ.jpg</center>\n<center>By Steemit's talented artist @lgm-1</center>\n\nNaturally, I'd say take time to build. Once you're caught exploiting the system, in life or on Steemit, you're lose reputation whether or not if its digitally measurable. You can create as many accounts as you want and find a million ways to exploit everything, but ask yourself - what are you building?\n\nHere are some tips for maintaining reputation on Steemit:-\n- Steemit's a mutual aid society. While posts can be about anything, note there's a limited amount of funds going around each day. It's obvious that your reputation is at stake if you have somehow managed to acquire good support, but not giving back substantially.\n- Tags are like real estate. Choose appropriately. An example is if you're writing your opinions on something rather meta, I think it's prudent to respect the scientific community. For example in [my article about consciousness](https://steemit.com/consciousness/@kevinwong/let-s-talk-about-consciousness-wtf-is-it), I've deliberately used the ***pseudoscience*** tag, no matter how right I think I could be. I clearly think about such topics often, but I never put myself in research labs knowing about consciousness well enough to indicate that I am the master of that domain.\n- Follow up on your promises. Communicate transparently.\n- Put in more effort, visibly and even behind the scenes when you manage to acquire good payouts.\n- Try to follow others. Curate and also support other members.\n- Plan your battles and don't milk it! And also, celebrity attitudes won't last long here if you're not giving back to the community. @dollarvigilante is doing this right - he's aiding others and even curating frequently on his free time!\n- Again, in general, give more than you can take.\n\n### Reputation is everything - for survival, for change in a social landscape.\n\n*Note: There is some form of censorship of the mind when it comes to chance of interruption from higher powers. It's the same everywhere. You just have to play your cards right, opting for different methods, different approaches. It's not really a systems-problem. It's a people-problem, as always. Never leave an opening for others to destroy your reputation.*\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n<center>Stock photos courtesy of https://pixabay.com/</center>\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n<center>Follow me @kevinwong</center>\n-------------------------------------------------",

    "body": "<h1>Who Should We Find Responsible For The Subprime Mortgage Lending Crisis?</h1>\n\nI want to preface this article by saying, I\u2019m not 100% sure who we should blame for the Subprime Mortgage Lending Crisis, the lenders or the borrowers which is why I want to attempt to fairly give arguments from both sides. Even today this is a heavily debated topic and I agree with points made by both sides. So I want you to decide as the reader, who you side with, and if you want to post in the comments below. This article is meant to shed light on who we should hold responsible for the Subprime Mortgage Crisis, the lenders or the borrowers, or someone else?\n\nhttp://longislandbankruptcyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/mortgage-bubble-bursting-by-the-sub-prime-mortgage-meltdown.jpg\n\n<h1>The Lender\u2019s Side of The Argument</h1>\n\nThe lender\u2019s side of the argument almost completely revolves around the idea that people need to educate themselves before they go into a bank and take on such a series contract, like a mortgage. Even in many cases where the information was fully available to the borrower, they signed the contract even though they didn\u2019t understand it. If you agree with consumer protection, the lenders should have stopped the transaction from taking place, but many believe that we should be free to make all decisions even bad ones. The truth is that these are companies, however and their only job is to look out for themselves. This lending is an especially weird occurrence because the force which usually stops this kind of behavior from taking place is that it would not be beneficial to the company, but mortgage brokers and the companies lending were making so much money that at the time it seemed like a good idea. \n\nhttps://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/questions-lender.jpg\n\nAnother way the lenders justify their subprime lending practices was that they were getting pressure from higher up in the company to lend as much as possible because there was such a demand for the financial products on the markets. This is the old \u201cI was just following orders\u201d excuse, but there truly was heavy pressure from companies onto the brokers to loan as much as they could, or they would find someone else to do it. At the time most mortgage brokers legitimately didn\u2019t think that they were doing something bad. They didn\u2019t try to tank the system, they truly believed that the booming real estate market would be able to cover any losses if someone foreclosed on a property. We found out that this was a horribly wrong assumption eventually which lead to billions in toxic assets on the bank balance sheet worth nothing. Ultimately if you think that the consumer should have been diligent and did the required research before they took the mortgage contract, you might side with the side of the lenders\n\n<h1> The Borrower\u2019s Side of The Argument</h1>\n\nOn the flip side, the borrower\u2019s side of the argument claims that it is a company\u2019s duty to inform the customer and the government\u2019s duty to provide consumer protection so mortgages that were created with a high chance of failure wouldn\u2019t be possible. Borrowers also claim that many of the brokers specifically targeted low income and uneducated applicants so they could get a larger commission. In addition, the extreme leniency of the various types of mortgage products that were being offered at the time, for example not having to even show any income, should have been against the law. While not all brokers were predatory, there were many that were, which did target the low income and uneducated, but at the same time there were many borrowers who knew they couldn\u2019t afford the payments on the house and figured they would just resell it for profit. Consumer protection is a tricky subject , because at what point does it stop becoming protection and start becoming a barrier to entry. For example up until this year only Americans with an income of 250k + or 1,000,000 in assets (disregarding primary residence) were able to invest in private companies, many hedge funds and other investment vehicles, all because of consumer protection. \n\nhttps://activerain-store.s3.amazonaws.com/image_store/uploads/2/5/4/4/3/ar123584050234452.jpg\n\nMany people say that a fool and his money soon part ways and it\u2019s hard to wonder if people who signed into these mortgages would have lost money elsewhere on credit cards or payday loans. I think that the mortgage prices that were way to complex for anyone to even understand should have never been offered, but is it the government\u2019s place to protect a private entity from not offering them? Theoretically in a free market banks should not have offered the products because they were too risky and would have lost them money, but this force did not prevail. Whether or not you agree with the borrower heavily comes down to what degree you think consumer protection should play on your everyday life and how the government should police products. \n\n<h1>Conclusion And Some Of My Thoughts</h1>\n\nLike I said when I started the article I don\u2019t think I find either party solely responsible for the subprime mortgage crisis that occurred. I believe both parties over leveraged themselves and took risks that, in hindsight, were insane. The world market wanted more mortgage prices and people all around the world were willing to pay large amounts for them, so banks and mortgage brokers supplied the demand that was out there. Unfortunately the mortgages they supplied them with were garbage. In this regard I blame the credit rating agencies, whose actual job is to rate them properly , for not doing their job. I also believe that the specific brokers and lenders who were predatory lending were morally wrong, but I\u2019m not so sure that they constitute acting criminally. Maybe under current laws yes, but im someone who does not believe in consumer protection, mostly because I believe that people should be able to spend their money as they see fit on any product they see fit. We see 1000 scams on the internet a day, yet we don\u2019t fall for them because we know they are scams. I think trusting any entity that is making money off you is foolish. Im interested to see what other people here think and why.",

Severe depression strips you from being able to experience any joy in life, even when for all the world it appears you have everything going for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;Watered down commentaries attempt to describe the soul rotting misery of waking up in darkness every day. Who are those who can bolt out of bed ready to face the day with their happy attitudes about life? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been one. I dread waking up. One of the things really depressed people look forward to is a respite from consciousness. This is why those who suffer tend to sleep so much. It\u2019s escapism. Yet it isn\u2019t, because even in sleep you can be terrorized by your daytime demons. The quality of sleep is not restful \u2013 in fact, rather fitful. This is one reason so many people take mind-numbing tranquilizers to dull their wakeful state just to be able to drift away to somewhere, <em>anywhere </em>else than the dangerous and unchecked arena of the mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>People experience the tiers of depression's challenges in different ways. It\u2019s not being disappointed or being in a bad mood if something doesn\u2019t pan out in your favor. You chipped you manicure? Bugger. Irritating, yes, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. For a depressed person, &nbsp;something minor (for whatever reason) can hurl you head first into a bottomless void of regret and agony. You associate daily life with walking through a minefield. Danger lurks with every step. That ad for an antidepressant that shows a cartoon figure walking around under her own cloud of rain sums up the feeling quite well (of course it does \u2013 sponsored by The Pharmaceutical Cartel). You NEED this drug to function. That\u2019s another post, and I know far too well how drugs are touted as the magic solution. Not even children are safe from their campaigns.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/Brain1b12cc.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"705\"/></p>\n<p>It\u2019s the ultimate mind-fuck factory, this thought prison that leads you through Dante\u2019s circles of hell as you try to scramble your way out of the snake pit. The thoughts pull you back in by your ankles. Like a horror movie, the entity of depression knows what scares you. It knows what makes you wail in despair. It knows your saddest thoughts and flashes those across the movie screen in your head in incessant reruns. You are a spectator, but unable to avert your eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have things to do? Most can buck up and get 'er done. A very depressed person knows what must be done yet can\u2019t do it. Cannot. It\u2019s not possible. It has nothing to do with laziness and everything to do with apathy. The effort isn\u2019t worth it. You know you will feel better if such and such gets done. So the obvious solution is to do it. You have errands to run? Get in the car and go. But for a depressed person, the mundane becomes detestable to such an extent that not even the guilt for not doing the things is unable to motivate you enough to accomplish what is impossible in your mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/Blanche134386.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"698\"/></p>\n<p>Once while touring Alcatraz, I was struck by something the tour guide told us. The island is positioned in just the right way that all the prisoners could smell the Ghirardelli chocolate factory wafting its chocolate scent across the bay, no doubt driving inmates insane. This is much like depression. You are stuck in a jail cell knowing everyone else is living happily while you miss out on what you know (on some level) is a gift \u2013 life itself. You can only observe from afar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You know those days when you feel like a sloth and nothing gets done? For many depressed people that\u2019s every day. By getting nothing done I don\u2019t mean cleaning out the refrigerator or reading a book your friend needs back. I mean responsibilities you must accept as an adult, as a parent. You can\u2019t function. Your kids are hungry, but you can\u2019t do anything about it because you can\u2019t move. You have an empty stare and wonder if it\u2019s too early for a drink. It\u2019s only one in the afternoon. Can it be justified? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And you can\u2019t stop seeing those stories about the Yulin dog meat festival. This is horrible because an animal suffering is the worst thing in the world to me. Or those commercials by the SPCA. The thoughts hit hard, bating me. \u201cUh oh! She\u2019s making some progress \u2013 what is she sad about? Let\u2019s infect.\u201d Self-sabotage is the name of the game. For a depressed person, thoughts take over and pollute your whole mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You hope you will feel better tomorrow, or someday. You keep saying someday. But that wastes away today. You hide from friends and family because the idea of faking a smile is akin to torture. And you think no one cares about your problems. Or they are tired of hearing about them because they are always the same. &nbsp;&nbsp;Your brain is wired differently. Some of the most creative genius comes from a desolate mental state. It can, but only If you can get any mental energy together to be productive. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your friends email you cures for migraines. You have had to invent numerous excuses that involve having them, because that\u2019s a reasonable excuse to cancel plans. Saying you\u2019re sad or not in the mood will get \u201cI\u2019ll cheer you up\u201d from well-meaning friends and family. But you want to be alone, completely isolated, in bed, with the covers pulled up over your head. And you want to cry. And I don\u2019t mean a few tears. I mean heart-wrenching sobs that no one would want to hear. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You yell at people you love. You cry easily. They can\u2019t help you but they can sure piss you off. And we are pissed at ourselves, because children have needs that must be met -no question about it. And you know are letting them down with your suffering. Another blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;We do not feel sorry for ourselves in the traditional sense. We do feel sorry that we can\u2019t get a grip as we are often told to do. We feel guilty for letting others down who matter as they stand by helpless, completely befuddled about their roles in all of this. They feel responsible You want to convey it\u2019s not them or their fault, but they start to not believe you. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. It simply is. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some days are easier than others. I often do well when the stars align - deceptively so, or maybe not deceptive. Maybe I am getting a handle on this curse. It\u2019s a constant roller coaster of wondering when the happy cart will upturn and everything you manage to put in there (composure, self-esteem, productivity) scatters across the road. And cars are coming, but you have to try to summon up the ability to put them back in and continue on your journey. It\u2019s like you are that one slow car on a hill that everyone zips past because they don\u2019t carry the burden of your load. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Is life a beautiful thing? Yes. It is. Is it filled with sadness? Yes to that too. Can a depressed person overcome depression? I think so. But in order to answer that, you must be willing to look at your origins to discover what might be holding you back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/HeadlessHoreseman96dd9.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"822\"/></p>\n<p>Drawings and painting \u00a9 Johanna Westerman 2016 &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

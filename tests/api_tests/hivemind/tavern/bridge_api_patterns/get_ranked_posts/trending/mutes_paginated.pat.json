One month ago, Project Curie began with humble beginnings. It has been an exhilarating experience for the team and we are delighted to share our progress with the Steemit community. To know more about Project Curie, do check out our <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@donkeypong/announcing-project-curie-bringing-rewards-and-recognition-to-steemit-s-undiscovered-and-emerging-authors\">initial announcement.</a></p><hr>\n<h3>Project Curie wishes to thank @pharesim, @val, @silversteem and @clayop along with @nextgencrypto and @berniesanders for helping us reward more deserving posts</h3>\n<p>When a group of Steemit writers got together to form Project Curie, we thought that if we pooled our own votes on some posts, we could help reward some emerging and undiscovered authors who were posting great original material.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>$5 later, it was clear our combined votes wouldn\u2019t make a huge difference.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we were able to form a partnership with @nextgencrypto who was generous enough to donate some voting power to help reward deserving posters who were not yet established. @berniesanders then joined to help. With their support, Project Curie became a reality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today, we announce that @val, @pharesim, @silversteem and @clayop also have donated additional voting power to help Project Curie reach a greater number of original content posts from undiscovered and deserving authors. Please join us in thanking them. And please do not send your posts directly to any of these individuals; Project Curie is curating the posts and you are welcome to submit any good ones you find to the #curie channel on Steemit.chat.</p><hr>\n\n<center><h2>Proyecto Cervantes</h2></center>\n<p>Project Curie is excited to announce a new branch of curation created to support Spanish authors on Steemit. The branch is called \u201cProyecto Cervantes\u201d and it\u2019s main curators are @gargon and @pgarcgo. The goal is to find and reward Spanish or bilingual (Spanish and English) posts on Steemit in order to foster a more diverse community. @gargon and @pgarcgo will be creating a compilation post for every 10 posts that they curate in order to provide transparency as to which posts are being rewarded. The hope is also to provide the original authors more exposure. You can find their first compilation posts <a href=\"https://steemit.com/spanish/@gargon/proyecto-cervantes-08-11-sept-2016-compensacion-y-reconocimiento-para-escritores-de-habla-hispana-bringing-rewards-and\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://steemit.com/spanish/@pgarcgo/proyecto-cervantes-11-13-sept-2016-compensacion-y-reconocimiento-para-escritores-de-habla-hispana-bringing-rewards-and\">here</a>. Two members of Project Curie are Spanish speakers ( @anwenbaumeister and @the-alien), and they provide a second line of curation and review for these posts. So, if you are a Spanish speaker, we encourage you to begin writing bilingual posts in order to create a bridge between the two languages and communities!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<center><h2>Statistics from Month #1</h2>\n<p>Total posts curated: <strong>2055<br>\n</strong>Unique authors rewarded: <strong>763<br>\n</strong>Total rewards generated for authors: SBD <strong>158,151<br>\n</strong>Mean reward generated per post: SBD <strong>77<br>\n</strong>Median reward generated per post: SBD <strong>40 &nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/curie-1da303.jpg\" width=\"1316\" height=\"858\"/></p></center>\n<p>Since we began tracking on 18th August, we have consistently voted on an average of over 75 posts per day. The trajectory is clearly heading up, and in the last week we have been averaging nearly 100 posts.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Authors</strong></h3>\n<p>The Top 10 Authors by number of posts curated were -</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>@kimal73 &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>@herverisson &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>@cristi &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>@lukeofkondor &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>@papa-pepper &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>@cryptos &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>@mariandavp &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>@stephmckenzie &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>@eveningstar92 &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>@prufarchy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Top Authors by payouts includes @alexbeyman, @kaylinart, @brianphobos, @jamielefay, @omfedor, @stephmckenzie, @ionescur, @aboundlessworld and @anotherjoe. Many of those names are pretty familiar today, but less than a month ago, they were new authors struggling for exposure.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tags/Topics</strong></h3>\n<p>The most used tag was \"life\", but that pretty much includes everything!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/curie-23f98a.jpg\" width=\"1269\" height=\"775\"/></p>\n<p>The most popular topics were \"art\" (549) and \"photography\" (418). \"Story\" and \"writing\" were pretty close, tagged on around 370 posts each, though we suspect these two tags are often repeated. \"Travel\" and \"science\" also make an appearance. Looking forward, we intend to focus more on original science and technology related posts, and other unique / niche topics.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>#curie</h3>\n<p>Following our announcement on September 2nd, the #curie channel has been a remarkable success. Currently we have 218 users in the room, 44 of whom have curated content from other authors. We have upvoted 105 posts submitted in #curie, and paid out SBD 525 to curators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Top curators from #curie were -</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>@pfunk</li>\n  <li>@kental</li>\n  <li>@jamtaylor</li>\n  <li>@deviedev</li>\n  <li>@royaltiffany</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Join us on #curie at Steemit.chat and keep the submissions coming!&nbsp;</p><hr>\n<center><h2>Thanks</h2></center>\n<p>Last, but not least, we wish to thank -&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@knozaki2015, @shaka, @razvanelulmarin, @greenwayoflife, @jasonstaggers for their generous donations.<br>\n@royaltiffany for moderating #curie and creating the noble TheButler bot. :)<br>\n@firepower for setting up the #curie room.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>And of course, everyone voting on and commenting on posts we curate!</strong></p><hr>\n<center><h2>Onward to Month #2!&nbsp;</h2></center>\n<p>We are working to increase our reach and rewards for authors, courtesy of extended whale support. We are also setting up @curie as a universal voter for all posts we curate. This way, you can choose to mirror our votes to support the authors. Look out for an announcement regarding this in our Daily Curation List posts. From next week, every Monday we'll have a Weekly Roundup with statistics, similar to this post.</p>\n<p>We are always open to feedback, and would love to know how you feel we could do better in Month #2!</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "#### Hey guys, welcome to the first chapter of my new novel.\n#### It is a mixture of 3 time lines, with 19th century, modern day and ancient times. The genre is probably something you would call a mixture of sci-fi, mystery, adventure and a bit more. \n#### Well, I welcome you to be the judge...\n\n<center> <h1> [![b801c049484636e0faf71f56cca03864c0bd6.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/b801c049484636e0faf71f56cca03864c0bd6.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/1wrYT)</h1></center>\n\n__________________________________\n\n**Chapter ONE**\n\nIt seemed as nothing was different in yet another cold and slightly windy London evening. The smog from the river was rising up as usual and the chilly wind would bring the smell up to the embankment, where Charles was taking a rest, sitting down on his favorite bench. \n\nFrom here he could see the might of the power station from across the river and something was special in the way those chimneys threw out the smoke onto the city. \n\nHe just finished his walk along his usual route, walking amongst the cemetery outside the chapel. It always amused him; that mix of emotion and sorrow amongst the busy city people, especially during the busy afternoon hours.\n\nThat rusty smell kept mixing with up with the light freshness of the leaves from the tree nearby Charles\u2019s bench. As he threw a brief glimpse onto the clock on the parliament building he noticed that the small arrow was on 45 minutes\u2026 \n\nSuddenly he heard a murmur of horses; he turned his head before he could finish realizing what time it was. He saw that just a few yards up the road two horse carriages didn\u2019t manage to share the drive way. \n\n<center> [![Saratogacarriagec5af5.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Saratogacarriagec5af5.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/1w1bI) </center>\n\nOne of the coachmen was shouting something and angrily waving his hands. Charles was able to see from here that the coachmen\u2019s grey clothing was partially covered in dirt, probably from the splash of the puddles from underneath the wheels. \n\nThe coachmen kept shouting something, Charles was unable to see the second carriage from where he was sitting, but was able to see some passersby, that starting to gather around the incident.\n\nIt was obvious that, just like him, those people had nothing better to do on this late afternoon then to watch in amusement the accident in the middle of the avenue.\n\nJust as Charles was starting to lose interest in the whole situation, the door of the cab that Charles could see, opened and a man dressed in a black suit and holding a pipe stepped out. He calmly put his hand in the upper inner pocket of the suit and pulled out some coins. The man made two steps up to driver and handed him the coins. At this moment the driver stopped shouting for a moment and it was clear from the look on his face that he was confused. \n\nThe cab driver counted the coins and said something to the man in the suit, the passenger didn\u2019t answer. He turned around and started to walk in the direction of the chapel. The cab driver clearly wasn\u2019t happy. He started to shout once again, but this time at the passenger. While the cab driver turned his attention to the passenger, Charles noticed how the second carriage that was involved in the accident managed to move a few yards back.\n\nIt was a much smaller carriage, and the driver was clearly seeable to Charles now. He seemed somewhat happy that he was not in the middle of the light anymore; he hurryingly turned the carriage and the horse around and started to move also in the direction of the chapel. \n\nAt this moment the driver of the first carriage started to lose interest in shouting and decided to clean himself up. As he started to calm down, the bemused passersby begun to walk back to where they were heading and Charles also turned his head back towards the power station.\n\nCharles was so busy watching the situation unfold that he didn\u2019t noticed that the passenger of the first carriage crossed the road and was now heading not towards the chapel anymore, but exactly in the other direction, towards the grey bench that Charles was sitting on.\n\nAt first Charles didn\u2019t pay any attention to just another man who was walking by. But then he noticed that calm walk of his and it hit him that this was the same passenger from the carriage.\n\n\u201cExcuse me sir?\u201d said Charles as the man closed up to the bench. \u201cYou are the gentleman from the carriage, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI saw you a minute ago, what happened?\u201d\n\nThe man stopped to walk and shared a look with Charles; he calmly sat down beside him and carried on smoking his pipe, as he was not hearing the questions Charles asked him. \n\n\u201cI do apologies for the intervention, but you must not be local, I can tell by your calmness, all the folks round here are always in a hurry\u201d Charles carried on talking as if not noticing that the man was ignoring him. \n\nAll of a sudden the weather begun to change, wind started to blow stronger and the few leaves that the tree was holding blew in the direction of the bench. The smell from the river rose up and as if that wasn\u2019t enough Charles felt like a small rain drop hit his head. He could clearly see the green water from where he was sitting through the decorations holes of the embankments fence. It was clear that it will start to rain soon by the appearing circles on the top of the river.\n\nAfter a few minutes of quietly seating by his new neighbor Charles caught himself looking at the clock on the tower, once again he saw the small arrow on 45 minutes\u2026\n\n\u201cAnd what do we pay the government for?\u201d \u201cIt would feel though they are taking our money and spend it on their fancy hats and suits, don\u2019t you find?\u201d Said Charles.\n\nAt this point the man took out the pipe into his left hand and begun to cough. After he finished coughing Charles heard him speak, at this point Charles understood that for some reason he would remember this moment for a long time to come. \n\n\u201cIt is likely to assume that they deserve to spend the money they earn\u201d Said the man, his voice was quite low and he had a certain accent Charles could quite catch.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that money is of importance nowadays\u201d Said the man.\n\nCharles looked at the man with a smile - \u201cWhat is of importance? One might assume that philosophically speaking, importance can be found in nothing but what is good to us\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo body knows what can be important to others if we carry on like this, then\u2026\u201d Charles didn\u2019t finish his sentence as the man turned away from him and looked the other way. He then turned his head back and Charles noticed his eyes. His eyes were nothing like what Charles had seen before, they looked as though they were glass like and the as if they were blank, there was nothing behind them.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is that I am here now and that it is happening today. It is important to live your life because, just like your life Charles, it has an end\u201d, the man looked somewhat happy when he said that and Charles jumped back on the bench a little, he felt a small shiver run down his spine.\n\n\u201cWhat? How do you know my name sir? Have you been following me?\u201d questions were racing through Charles\u2019s mind. \n\n\u201cAs I said, this is now of importance. You life can find its end today when you get back to your gallery in your cold basement on Kinnerton street or you might listen to me and\u2026\u201d Charles didn\u2019t let the man finish his sentence. He jumped up from the bench; his cane flew within millimeters of the stranger leg as he jumped.\n\n\u201cHow dare you sir? Who gives you the right\u2026\u201d Charles raised his voice, he never allowed himself to raise his voice at a stranger beforehand.\n\n\u201cI think this conversation is over!\u201d exclaimed Charles. \u201cThat would be your choice\u201d replied the man, \u201cDo you think the time is right?\u201d \n\nCharles had already turned away in anger and was about to make his first step away. Something in the words of the man about the time made him think for a second, thoughts raced through his mind. The number 45 and the small arrow of the parliament clock were stuck in his head. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand said Charles\u2026\u201d he turned his head back towards the clock; the arrow was still on 45 minutes. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Charles turned his head to the man, but there was no one on the bench. \n\nCharles begun to search the street rapidly with his eyes, it didn\u2019t even occur to him that it was heavily raining until that moment. \n\n<center> [![tumblr_mkbyo2aby01s0rai7o1_50004ba9.gif](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/tumblr_mkbyo2aby01s0rai7o1_50004ba9.gif)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/1w5tK) </center>\n\nThe streets were empty; there were no carriages or people to be seen around. Feeling scared he turned his head to the clock once again \u2013 \u201cHow can it still be 45 minutes...\u201d Charles was speaking out loud.\n\nThe next moment he felt like his knees weakened, his head was swirling and he dropped his cane, last thing he could hear was the clinging the of the cane\u2019s handle against the pavement. His thoughts mixed up with his eyesight; the man and his pipe, the handle of the clock, the carriage, the passersby, the power stations smoke\u2026\n \n_________________________________\n\n#### Follow me @serejandmyself for more \n\nImage credit - [1](https://ru.pinterest.com/spookynerd/i-m-a-surrealism-chick/)  ; [2](https://giphy.com/search/carriage) ; [3](http://www.ibsrt.com/imglist/horse-and-carriage-id-48037-p-1.html) ;",

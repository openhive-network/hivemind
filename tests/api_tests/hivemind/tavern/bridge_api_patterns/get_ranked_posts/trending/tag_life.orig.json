Finally, the hands found the catches at either side of the helmet and popped it off. A black, shaggy head of hair emerged.* \n\n***If you've missed episodes, [visit my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr) to catch up. Be sure to follow  me for updates in your feed!***\n\n\u201cEmil?\u201d Stella said, \u201cMeet Joshua. Are you okay?\u201d\n\nEmil, the Reaper suit\u2019s operator laughed, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine, but that was awesome! Can you teach us that?\u201d\n\n\u201cMan! Now I have to rebuild this helmet,\u201d Phil held up a small remote. \u201cAll I had to do was push this button,\u201d he said, pressing it, as the suit powered down. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018nerve\u2019 bundle that controls these things motor skills is on the very top of the skull, under a thin piece of sheet metal, puncture it, it collapses. You didn\u2019t know that?\u201d Joshua said. \n\n\u201cWell, it appears we may need you more than you need us,\u201d Stella said. \u201cSo, just say the word and we\u2019ll get you where you need to be. Meanwhile, my team will be working on your son\u2019s location.\u201d\n\nJoshua dropped the letter opener and walked to the stairs, \u201cFine, whatever you need to collect from my meeting, get it. Now, who\u2019s driving?\u201d With that, he walked up the stairs, he had no more time to waste. \n\n**The Mapleton courthouse sat on a hill in the center of the town, overlooking the area around for miles.** \n\n*Joshua insisted that the team Stella had sent stop 5 miles out and allow him to ride in on the electric trike alone, while they observed the meeting from a distance.* \n\nHe carried the tiny remote in his shirt pocket, a gift from Phil. \u201cThat\u2019s my only prototype, so don\u2019t lose it,\u201d he\u2019d said. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s12.postimg.org/siuqjuiz1/Untitled_36.jpg)\n\nFrom the end of Main Street, looking up toward the courthouse, Joshua counted at least six reapers. He wondered how far the signal from the remote would travel. \n\nHe thought about pressing it now, disarming his enemy, then walking in, but he\u2019d still have to deal with the six drivers, if they managed to escape the suits. \n\nBesides, Stella seemed to think there was some secret they were going to give away, although Joshua couldn\u2019t imagine it. \n\n*He checked his watch, ten minutes until his scheduled time and while he knew better than to be late, he had no intention of giving the Consensus one more second than he had to.* \n\nThe trike spun it\u2019s tires on a patch of loose gravel as he started back up. He decided a quick approach was best. He charged up the hill, jumping the \u201cMayor\u2019s\u201d parking barrier and rolling up to the foot of the front stairs, he cranked the accelerator and the trike rose up on its back wheel, popping the two front wheels, over the bottom step. \n\nThe machine had more than enough power to climb the steps and Joshua skidded to a stop outside the courthouse door. He stopped and turned back toward the town, the six Reapers swarming toward him up the steps. He powered down, swung his leg up and over the bike and opened the door. \n\n**The Reapers followed him into the hall as he approached the court room.** \n\nThe Magistrate sat behind the judge\u2019s bench and Joshua couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the insult to the very concept of actual justice that this thing represented. \n\n\u201cJoshua Claiborne, appearing as requested,\u201d Joshua said, standing directly in front of the Magistrate. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s12.postimg.org/6h4lvyh7x/judge.jpg)\n\n> \u201cYes, Mr. Claiborne, have a seat,\u201d A woman\u2019s face, projected on the face shield of the Magistrate said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather stand,\u201d he said. \n\n> \u201cSuit yourself, may we have the room, please?\u201d she said, looking toward the reapers that had entered the back doors of the courtroom.\n\nThey left quietly. \n\n> \u201cMr. Claiborne, you\u2019re charged with violation of the first law, in so\n> much as you have encouraged and joined in the activity of settling\n> outside of Consensus approved areas, acted outside of the legal\n> jurisdiction of the council and on more than  one occasion, acted\n> against the best interest of Consensus, including attacking duly\n> authorized Magistrates in the course of their legally binding duties,\n> how do you plead?\u201d\n\n**The woman looked at Joshua, peering over a pair of short, square spectacles, like some sort of outdated stereotype.** \n\n\u201cNot guilty, by reason of illegitimacy of the currently established government and its ensigns. I am not, nor do I choose to become, subject to your law. I stand judged as innocent by natural law, insomuch as I have not caused harm to another human in aggression, damaged or stolen property, nor unnecessarily restricted the liberty of any other person. I recognize no other responsibility to my fellow man,\u201d Joshua said calmly. \n\n> \u201cBe that as it may, Mr. Claiborne, we are not here under the auspices of \u201cnatural law\u201d but rather, under the Council mandated authority of the Consensus and its Magisterial Ministry, of which I am a part and I assure you, you are subject to,\u201d\n\nThe woman intoned, her expression one of almost sheer boredom.\n\n> \u201cCourt finds the defendant guilty and remands the subject for immediate judicial murder.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate raised its arm and brought it down on the bench with a solid thud, that echoed through the court. Joshua felt his heart sink as the Reapers reentered the court and moved up to surround him. \n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

    "body": "Is this a typo? Benefits? You ask. How could there be any possible benefit from having a disability?\n\nWell, in fact there are. And here are three unexpected benefits I have personally experienced in my own journey living with a degenerating eye condition.\n\n## Improved lateral thinking and innovation\nGrowing up with a vision impairment meant that there were often things that most people took for granted, but which I struggled to do. To do the same things, I needed to come up with creative solutions and alternative ways of doing things. So from a very young age, I learnt to think laterally and developed my problem solving skills. Most people are so use to perceiving the world in a certain way, but when you are stripped of one of your senses, you learn to perceive things in a different way.\n\nhttps://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmWb5pzYhKKJZ8zmeYqVeV6oNqGi5h7yDEtxBbjwRdTUZ7\n\nWhen I was still living by myself a few years ago, I had the annoying task of having to cook for myself each night. The challenge I faced in the kitchen was not been able to read the labels on various bottles and containers. As a result, I couldn't tell which container was the salt and which one was the sugar, and all the packaging for the herbs looked the same. So how did I manage? Instead of using sight, I used my sense of smell to distinguish between the herbs, and for some ingredients where I couldn't use the sense of smell, I used different containers and labels to help me identify all the different ingredients.\n\nAnd this leads on to the second benefit.\n\n## Improved memory\nPeople who know me well often comment on my ability to remember things. In fact, I've noticed this in many other people I know who also have a vision impairment. I think this is due to the fact that for someone with a vision impairment to thrive in a sighted world, we often need to make extra effort to adapt to our circumstances.\n\nFor example, I remember when I was still in university, I had to do many presentations. For most people, they could refer to speech notes as they are presenting. However, for me, this was not possible, as I couldn't read speech notes no matter how big the font was. Furthermore, as I have some sight, I never needed to learn braille, which meant I couldn't refer to braille notes either. _As a side note, this is why the title of my memoir which I've been posting on Steemit is \"Living in Between Two Worlds\", because I have often found myself being caught between the world of the sighted and the world of the blind, and also between the identity of being Chinese but not fully Chinese, and being Australian but not fully Australian._ As a result, every time I had to do a presentation, I would always remember the entire speech. Over time, this has become second nature to me. I have learnt how to force things into my memory, and be innovative when I need to.\n\n## Resilience\nGrowing up with a vision impairment, I experienced a lot of bullying at school and a lot of hurtful comments and actions from people, sometimes done knowingly and sometimes unknowingly. Sometimes this comes in the form of a patronising comment, and sometimes from a look or stare. The interesting thing with people staring and giving me strange looks is that I can often notice people are doing it to me because I have some peripheral vision, however people generally can't tell I'm looking back at them because it doesn't seem like I'm looking at them. Most of the time however, those hurtful words and actions are done out of ignorance and a lack of understanding, rather then out of malice.\n\n#### But from all these things I've experienced, it has made me a stronger and more resilient person.\nAs a result, whatever unforeseen things I may experience in life, there's not much that can knock me out completely. I have developed the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and stay optimistic, because as they say:\n### What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.\n\nSo I'm thankful to God for the person I have become today. Disability isn't all bad. Without what I have gone through with my vision impairment, I wouldn't be the person I am today, and for these reasons, I am thankful.\n\nTo read more about my story, you can read my short memoir series.

    "body": ">Today I told my dad the final date of my marriage: October 2nd . Few days ago, as I told him that I was going to get married in a few weeks, he got mad at me. \u201cI was expecting you to get a real job before you got married!\u201d was his main critique. \u201cHow can you get married *now*?\u201d he asked me.\n\nOggi ho detto a mio padre la data definitiva del mio matrimonio: due ottobre. Pochi giorni fa, quando gli ho detto che mi sarei sposato nel giro di poche settimane, si \u00e8 arrabbiato con me. \u201cMi sarei aspettato che ti trovassi un lavoro vero prima di sposarti\u201d \u00e8 stato il suo principale oggetto di critica. \u201cCome puoi sposarti *adesso*?\u201d mi ha chiesto.\n\n>Let me give you some background. I\u2019m 29 years old and I want to do many things in my life. I studied economics, worked for no-profit and academia and I published a book in May on the shifting economic paradigm. I dedicated the last year to this book, spent all the savings I had and by now I have a few weeks of financial autonomy left. Meanwhile I rented a room on Airbnb, learned how to do bracelets and sold them on the Ligurian (North-West Italy) seaside. Simultaneously, I\u2019m working on becoming what I call a cryptofarmer: in fact, my goal is to write and earn cryptocurrencies while living in the countryside in a small house I\u2019m transforming into a farm. I learned how to plant a vegetable garden, how to chop wood and limiting the expenses of food and heating.\nEven if sometimes I\u2019m scared I could not afford a living, I feeI I can make it. We can make it. In fact, few months ago a girl I met last winter in Chile joined me and is providing great help with her skills and work. And I\u2019m going to marry her in a few weeks, as I said.\n\nFacciamo un passo indietro. Ho 29 anni e voglio fare tante cose nella mia vita. Ho studiato economia, lavorato nel no-profit e nel mondo accademico per poi pubblicare, a maggio di quest\u2019anno, un libro sul cambio di paradigma in economia. Ho dedicato l\u2019ultimo anno a questo libro, ho speso tutti i miei risparmi e ho davanti ancora qualche settimana di autonomia finanziaria. Nel frattempo ho affittato una stanza su Airbnb e imparato a fare braccialetti che ho venduto sulla costa ligure. Parallelamente lavoro per diventare quello che chiamo un cryptofarmer; il mio obiettivo \u00e8 infatti quello di scrivere e guadagnare cripto-valute mentre vivo in una piccola casa di campagna che sto trasformando in fattoria. Ho imparato come piantare un orto, spaccare la legna e limitare le spese di cibo e riscaldamento.\nAnche se a volte ho paura di non riuscire a guadagnarmi da vivere, sento che ce la posso fare. Che ce la *possiamo* fare. Qualche mese fa, infatti, una ragazza che ho conosciuto lo scorso inverno in Cile si \u00e8 unita ai miei progetti e mi sta dando un grosso aiuto con le sue capacit\u00e0 e il suo lavoro. E io la sposer\u00f2 in qualche settimana, come dicevo.\n>My father is 69 years old. Oddly enough, he actually left countryside for the city \u2013 a choice diametrically opposite to the one I made \u2013 to become a lawyer and had success by working really hard. As far as I know, he wanted to be a journalist but chose to be a lawyer to get a better salary \u2013 as he got. He wanted me to be a lawyer too, of course, but when I chose to study economics he told me I could become an auditor; those were professions, in his words, that paid good.\n\nMio padre ha 69 anni. E\u2019 curioso come lui lasci\u00f2 la campagna per la citt\u00e0 \u2013 una scelta diametralmente opposta a quella che ho fatto io \u2013 per diventare un avvocato e l\u00ec ha avuto successo lavorando molto. Da quel che so, lui voleva fare il giornalista da giovane, ma poi ha scelto di fare l\u2019avvocato per avere un miglior salario \u2013 come appunto si \u00e8 verificato. Chiaramente voleva che anche io facessi l\u2019avvocato e successivamente, quando io scelsi di studiare economia, mi disse che potevo diventare il revisore contabile; mestieri, questi, che secondo lui erano ben remunerati. \n>Dear dad,\nA couple of years ago, you told that you were eventually glad I didn\u2019t follow your path and became a lawyer. The job had changed too much, you said. Now too many lawyers are fighting one against each other to get the job and clients are not paying for the work you did for them. That\u2019s how you described me your job \u2013 a job that in Italy, for your generation, was a synonym of success. A son who became a lawyer was a dream for the average family.\nWell, I\u2019m going to add a little piece to this picture. In a few decades, the whole profession of lawyer may become obsolete. Do you know that even today you can ask legal question to [Ross](http://www.psfk.com/2015/01/ross-ibm-watson-powered-lawyer-legal-research.html), an IBM powered machine? It will provide you an answer by sifting through thousands of legal documents, statutes and cases - assisting you to get ready for the case by including citations, suggested readings and confidence ratings. \nToday few technologies are ready to disrupt whole sectors of the economy. One of these is Artificial Intelligence that could make your profession obsolete. Another is the blockchain: that one could make the auditor and accountancy profession useless too. Have you ever heard about it? Some say it\u2019s important as the invention of the Internet.\n\nCaro pap\u00e0,\nQualche anno fa mi hai detto che in fin dei conti eri contento che non avessi seguito la tua strada e fossi diventato un avvocato. Il lavoro \u00e8 cambiato troppo, hai detto. Troppi avvocati in conflitto l\u2019uno contro l\u2019altro per accaparrarsi clienti che poi non pagano il lavoro che fai per loro. Cos\u00ec mi hai descritto il tuo lavoro \u2013 un lavoro che in Italia, per la tua generazione, era sinonimo di successo. Un figlio che diventava avvocato era un sogno per la famiglia media.\nBeh, lasciami aggiungere un pezzo a questa storia. In un paio di decadi, la professione stessa dell\u2019avvocato potrebbe diventare obsoleta. Sai che gi\u00e0 oggi puoi chiedere un parere legale a [Ross](http://www.psfk.com/2015/01/ross-ibm-watson-powered-lawyer-legal-research.html), una macchina sviluppata da IBM? Ti restituisce una risposta setacciando migliaia di documenti legali, statuti e casi \u2013 assistendoti a prepararti al caso includendo citazioni, letture consigliate e intervalli di confidenza. Alcune tecnologie sono sul punto di rivoluzionare interi settori dell\u2019economia. Una di queste \u00e8 l\u2019intelligenza artificiale che potrebbe rendere obsoleta la tua professione. Un\u2019altra \u00e8 la blockchain: questa potrebbe rendere inutile la professione del contabile e del revisore. Ne hai mai sentito parlare? Alcuni dicono che \u00e8 importante quanto l\u2019invenzione di Internet.\n>**You should really be glad I didn\u2019t choose your job just because it paid good**. As I was 18 (in 2005) being a lawyer paid good, in a decade it wasn\u2019t the case anymore. **In fact, between 2007 and 2014 the average income reported by Italian lawyers [declined from 51.314 euro to 37.505]( http://www.italiaoggi.it/news/dettaglio_news.asp?id=201603102026358478&chkAgenzie=ITALIAOGGI&titolo=Avvocati,%20redditi%20da%20dimenticare)**. Well, last decade  \u2013 it is to be said - was a *century*: while economy collapsed in one of the worst crisis ever, technology produced unparalleled innovations. Before 2005 there was no Youtube. In 2005 there was no smartphone either. No-one can tell what are we going to see in the next decade. Some say there will be some big change in the workplace. In fact, [some researchers at Oxford]( http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) say that by 2035, half of the jobs Americans currently hold will be automatized. **Robots are simply better than men in doing robotic work**. Even the world\u2019s most ancient profession may suffer a strong decline with the development of virtual reality \u2013 this has become the next big thing in adult entertainment.\n\n**Devi essere davvero contento che non abbia scelto il tuo lavoro solo perch\u00e9 era ben remunerato**. Quando ancora io avevo 18 anni (nel 2005) fare l\u2019avvocato era remunerativo, ma nell\u2019arco di un decennio ci\u00f2 non era pi\u00f9 vero. **Tra il 2007 e il 2014 il reddito medio dell\u2019avvocato italiano [\u00e8 sceso da 51.314 euro a 37.505 euro]( http://www.italiaoggi.it/news/dettaglio_news.asp?id=201603102026358478&chkAgenzie=ITALIAOGGI&titolo=Avvocati,%20redditi%20da%20dimenticare)**. L\u2019ultimo decennio \u2013 bisogna riconoscerlo - ha rappresentato un *secolo*: mentre l\u2019economia collassava in una delle peggiori crisi di sempre, la tecnologia produceva innovazioni senza pari. Prima del 2005 non c\u2019era Youtube. Prima del 2005 non c\u2019era nemmeno lo smartphone. Nessuno pu\u00f2 dire cosa vedremo nel prossimo decennio. Molti dicono che ci saranno grossi cambiamenti sul luogo di lavoro. [Alcuni ricercatori di Oxford]( http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) dicono che entro il 2035, il 45% dei lavori attualmente svolti dagli americani verr\u00e0 automatizzato. **I robot svolgono meglio degli uomini i lavori da robot**. Perfino il mestiere pi\u00f9 vecchio del mondo potrebbe risentire di un forte declino a seguito dello sviluppo della realt\u00e0 virtuale \u2013 questa \u00e8 diventata l\u2019ultima novit\u00e0 nel mondo dell\u2019intrattenimento per adulti.\n>Don\u2019t worry, dad, and don\u2019t look at me as someone who is living hand to mouth. Many things are changing in the next years, together with most of the reference points we had. Those jobs who were good, could not be profitable and stable anymore. Most of all, the same idea of stability will change: we\u2019ll have to find stability surfing between waves of change. Choosing a job just because it pays good today, may not be a good strategy. **My generation is challenged to find and develop that personal value, those talents, that no machine could substitute. This is what I\u2019m doing \u2013 soon I\u2019ll write you how**.\n\nPer questo, pap\u00e0, non preoccuparti e non guardarmi come si guarda un figlio che vive di espedienti. Molte cose cambieranno nei prossimi anni, insieme a molti dei punti di riferimento che avevamo. Quei lavori che prima erano buoni, potrebbero non essere pi\u00f9 remunerativi e stabili. Pi\u00f9 di tutto, cambier\u00e0 l\u2019idea di stabilit\u00e0: dovremmo imparare a trovare la stabilit\u00e0 di un surfista a cavallo di ondate di cambiamento. Scegliere un lavoro solo perch\u00e9 paga bene oggi, potrebbe non essere una strategia che paga. **La sfida per la mia generazione \u00e8 di trovare e sviluppare quel  valore personale, quei talenti, che nessuna macchina pu\u00f2 sostituire. Questo \u00e8 quello che sto facendo io \u2013 presto ti scriver\u00f2 come**.\n\nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/2hz9lz.jpg \n\n*Me, dad, fianc\u00e9, mum*\n\n***Don't forget to follow @cryptofarmer***\n***a shout out goes to @claudiop63 for assisting the Italian community so don't forget to follow him***",

    "body": "<center>https://s16.postimg.org/5csp5ocf9/kevv.jpg</center>\n\nHere I am spending the night in the darkness of my bedroom. Dog's snoring right beside me, his head resting on my chest. Feeling like I'm in some prologue of a cyberpunk story. Anyway, surfing on Steemit mobile is actually quite decent, despite the inadequacy of certain types of tables and media not showing up properly on screen.\n\nDecided to write this after going through some dramatic commentaries on Steemit that happened for the past few days. Mostly about ideological disagreements, and especially, overcompensation of posts. While I consider myself pretty critical, I usually opt out of direct, in-your-face type of confrontations. I prefer to plan and pick my own battles, having learned out of experience.\n\nBecause personally, I've never come across any situation that immediately improves itself after insults are thrown around. No one is going to admit wrong right away. Everyone's always right in their own world, and that's particularly true with the presence of an opposing voice. And it doesn't matter how zen one may be. No one's a perfect saint. Everyone has a breaking point. \n\nYup, I've snapped before, more than enough times to know this little fact of life. Nothing good comes out of throwing a fit (well not as much as can be). Sure, our message, our version of truth should be upheld. But there are better ways of fighting the good fight.. maybe like what I'm trying to do with this post right now. So what am I trying to address here?\n\n---------------------------\n# Plan your battles - don't join someone else's!\n<center>https://s10.postimg.org/ntels66d5/planning.jpg</center>\nThere was [a post on Steemit](https://steemit.com/anarchy/@kennyskitchen/the-40-anarchists-you-want-to-be-following-on-steemit) a while ago that labelled me an anarchist. Am I? Maybe I am. Sure, I'm against big, centralised governments. I may even detest the inherent thieving practices of big brother. But I'm still running a music event company - there are legal matters that I still need to run by government offices, purely out of safety and security reasons.\n\nYou may argue that it's perverted that I'm using an intrinsically violent agent (namely, The Government and The Police State) to secure the well-being of my business customers. Next I'll ask - can we have a decentralised free market doing music events with all the right securities? That's what my company, [Hybrid Entertainment](https://steemit.com/steemit-marketing/@kevinwong/our-next-dance-music-event-psychedelic-trance-some-steemit-love) partly aims to do. It's a learning process. \n\nFor now, we still need to use the existing structures of Old, Big Government.. while we find ways to transition out of such dependence. Fight too hard and you'll get clamped down, thrown out of the game. You can't do much when you're out of the game, so stay in it! Take the time to plan your battles, dear hot-blooded confrontationists (if that's even a word).\n\nSure, the world needs you to say things as they are. But hearing the painful truth is almost like violence itself. No one likes that, no matter which side of a dispute. Peace also involves peace of mind. It's a much longer game - it comes with the territory. You're already in someone else's fight once you get into war. Only get into war if you're the big guy. The small guy is always the loser - the unwilling pawn. Think about this in scope of what's happening all around the world, even on Steemit.\n\nDon't be a zealot. There are dangers of being too far left, or too far right. Find the middle way. All you need is another perspective. Some people may be asswipes, but goodness is omnipresent if the conditions are right.\n\nAnd that's how you plan your battles - take the time to do it right. \n\nIn perspective of my generally apolitical position on Steemit, I tend to find better ways to contribute instead of lashing out on another user. Sure, I have my dissatisfaction about some author rewards and posting models from time to time. However, I tried putting effort into building better models and figuring out ways to add substantial value into the ecosystem. Eventually, some of us gravitated towards a loose goal of rewarding diversity by combing contents on Steemit on a daily basis.\n\nThere are now epic giant hidden-gem megaposts on Steemit - like this one from [Project Curie](https://steemit.com/@curie) and [Robinhood Whale](https://steemit.com/@robinhoodwhale). Better coverage, better quality, better value - in so many ways. This is the free-market reaction to solo authored hidden-gem posts of early Steemit. No doubt that everything evolves over time. \n\nKnowing that value is subjective, I have always refrained from losing my cool. Even here on Steemit. \n\n**I'm the small fish and I have to plan my battles!**\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n# Don't freaking milk it!\n\n<center>https://s3.postimg.org/6ne6t272b/milk.jpg</center>\nThere are big reasons why most of us don't really like governments. Greed and corruption. Needless to say, the crowd easily picks up on this when insubstantial effort is rewarded handsomely. By all means, that's as subjective as can be. What's not (very) subjective, however, is if one continues to milk it, even despite public disapproval. \n\nThis happens all around the world. Don't oversell. You'll lose reputation if you are obviously **milking it**!\n\nSure, you may gain new followers.. newly inspired and freshly impressed. But old eyes grow weary. People are watching, and your social value fluctuates all the time. You can't please everyone, but you can try the **art of not milking the shit out of the system**.\n\nIt's a good business practice. It's a good personal conduct. And it works on Steemit.\n\nThat's a reason why I'm also posting lesser (other than plainly having a huge writer's block, reserving myself from random shitposting). Now I'm only writing when I really think I have something good to add as a post. As I'm partly dependent on Steemit, I've strategized a lil, refraining from appearing to be **milking it**, seeking modes of substantial contribution behind the scenes to compensate for the awesome support that has been given to me on this platform.\n\nIf you are suddenly rewarded thousands for a post - ask yourself. Is that post worth that much? Heck, I don't know if my top philosophical post is worth 4,000 bucks, but I know I've put long hours in it, enough to avoid milking and recycling the same content. Instead, I try to put more effort in other areas of the ecosystem to balance out the lopsided reward.\n\nThe blockchain is transparent. It's easy to find out if you're milking it. To avoid seeming like you're milking it - just be honest and ask yourself the right questions! Then, do the right thing!\n\n**Like life, like Steemit - try to give more than you can take. Don't. Freaking. Milk It.**\n\n----------------------------------\n\n# Take time to build, or take time to exploit?\n<center>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/T9b4dDQ.jpg</center>\n<center>By Steemit's talented artist @lgm-1</center>\n\nNaturally, I'd say take time to build. Once you're caught exploiting the system, in life or on Steemit, you're lose reputation whether or not if its digitally measurable. You can create as many accounts as you want and find a million ways to exploit everything, but ask yourself - what are you building?\n\nHere are some tips for maintaining reputation on Steemit:-\n- Steemit's a mutual aid society. While posts can be about anything, note there's a limited amount of funds going around each day. It's obvious that your reputation is at stake if you have somehow managed to acquire good support, but not giving back substantially.\n- Tags are like real estate. Choose appropriately. An example is if you're writing your opinions on something rather meta, I think it's prudent to respect the scientific community. For example in [my article about consciousness](https://steemit.com/consciousness/@kevinwong/let-s-talk-about-consciousness-wtf-is-it), I've deliberately used the ***pseudoscience*** tag, no matter how right I think I could be. I clearly think about such topics often, but I never put myself in research labs knowing about consciousness well enough to indicate that I am the master of that domain.\n- Follow up on your promises. Communicate transparently.\n- Put in more effort, visibly and even behind the scenes when you manage to acquire good payouts.\n- Try to follow others. Curate and also support other members.\n- Plan your battles and don't milk it! And also, celebrity attitudes won't last long here if you're not giving back to the community. @dollarvigilante is doing this right - he's aiding others and even curating frequently on his free time!\n- Again, in general, give more than you can take.\n\n### Reputation is everything - for survival, for change in a social landscape.\n\n*Note: There is some form of censorship of the mind when it comes to chance of interruption from higher powers. It's the same everywhere. You just have to play your cards right, opting for different methods, different approaches. It's not really a systems-problem. It's a people-problem, as always. Never leave an opening for others to destroy your reputation.*\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n<center>Stock photos courtesy of https://pixabay.com/</center>\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n<center>Follow me @kevinwong</center>\n-------------------------------------------------",

    "body": "<h1>Who Should We Find Responsible For The Subprime Mortgage Lending Crisis?</h1>\n\nI want to preface this article by saying, I\u2019m not 100% sure who we should blame for the Subprime Mortgage Lending Crisis, the lenders or the borrowers which is why I want to attempt to fairly give arguments from both sides. Even today this is a heavily debated topic and I agree with points made by both sides. So I want you to decide as the reader, who you side with, and if you want to post in the comments below. This article is meant to shed light on who we should hold responsible for the Subprime Mortgage Crisis, the lenders or the borrowers, or someone else?\n\nhttp://longislandbankruptcyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/mortgage-bubble-bursting-by-the-sub-prime-mortgage-meltdown.jpg\n\n<h1>The Lender\u2019s Side of The Argument</h1>\n\nThe lender\u2019s side of the argument almost completely revolves around the idea that people need to educate themselves before they go into a bank and take on such a series contract, like a mortgage. Even in many cases where the information was fully available to the borrower, they signed the contract even though they didn\u2019t understand it. If you agree with consumer protection, the lenders should have stopped the transaction from taking place, but many believe that we should be free to make all decisions even bad ones. The truth is that these are companies, however and their only job is to look out for themselves. This lending is an especially weird occurrence because the force which usually stops this kind of behavior from taking place is that it would not be beneficial to the company, but mortgage brokers and the companies lending were making so much money that at the time it seemed like a good idea. \n\nhttps://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/questions-lender.jpg\n\nAnother way the lenders justify their subprime lending practices was that they were getting pressure from higher up in the company to lend as much as possible because there was such a demand for the financial products on the markets. This is the old \u201cI was just following orders\u201d excuse, but there truly was heavy pressure from companies onto the brokers to loan as much as they could, or they would find someone else to do it. At the time most mortgage brokers legitimately didn\u2019t think that they were doing something bad. They didn\u2019t try to tank the system, they truly believed that the booming real estate market would be able to cover any losses if someone foreclosed on a property. We found out that this was a horribly wrong assumption eventually which lead to billions in toxic assets on the bank balance sheet worth nothing. Ultimately if you think that the consumer should have been diligent and did the required research before they took the mortgage contract, you might side with the side of the lenders\n\n<h1> The Borrower\u2019s Side of The Argument</h1>\n\nOn the flip side, the borrower\u2019s side of the argument claims that it is a company\u2019s duty to inform the customer and the government\u2019s duty to provide consumer protection so mortgages that were created with a high chance of failure wouldn\u2019t be possible. Borrowers also claim that many of the brokers specifically targeted low income and uneducated applicants so they could get a larger commission. In addition, the extreme leniency of the various types of mortgage products that were being offered at the time, for example not having to even show any income, should have been against the law. While not all brokers were predatory, there were many that were, which did target the low income and uneducated, but at the same time there were many borrowers who knew they couldn\u2019t afford the payments on the house and figured they would just resell it for profit. Consumer protection is a tricky subject , because at what point does it stop becoming protection and start becoming a barrier to entry. For example up until this year only Americans with an income of 250k + or 1,000,000 in assets (disregarding primary residence) were able to invest in private companies, many hedge funds and other investment vehicles, all because of consumer protection. \n\nhttps://activerain-store.s3.amazonaws.com/image_store/uploads/2/5/4/4/3/ar123584050234452.jpg\n\nMany people say that a fool and his money soon part ways and it\u2019s hard to wonder if people who signed into these mortgages would have lost money elsewhere on credit cards or payday loans. I think that the mortgage prices that were way to complex for anyone to even understand should have never been offered, but is it the government\u2019s place to protect a private entity from not offering them? Theoretically in a free market banks should not have offered the products because they were too risky and would have lost them money, but this force did not prevail. Whether or not you agree with the borrower heavily comes down to what degree you think consumer protection should play on your everyday life and how the government should police products. \n\n<h1>Conclusion And Some Of My Thoughts</h1>\n\nLike I said when I started the article I don\u2019t think I find either party solely responsible for the subprime mortgage crisis that occurred. I believe both parties over leveraged themselves and took risks that, in hindsight, were insane. The world market wanted more mortgage prices and people all around the world were willing to pay large amounts for them, so banks and mortgage brokers supplied the demand that was out there. Unfortunately the mortgages they supplied them with were garbage. In this regard I blame the credit rating agencies, whose actual job is to rate them properly , for not doing their job. I also believe that the specific brokers and lenders who were predatory lending were morally wrong, but I\u2019m not so sure that they constitute acting criminally. Maybe under current laws yes, but im someone who does not believe in consumer protection, mostly because I believe that people should be able to spend their money as they see fit on any product they see fit. We see 1000 scams on the internet a day, yet we don\u2019t fall for them because we know they are scams. I think trusting any entity that is making money off you is foolish. Im interested to see what other people here think and why.",

Severe depression strips you from being able to experience any joy in life, even when for all the world it appears you have everything going for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;Watered down commentaries attempt to describe the soul rotting misery of waking up in darkness every day. Who are those who can bolt out of bed ready to face the day with their happy attitudes about life? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been one. I dread waking up. One of the things really depressed people look forward to is a respite from consciousness. This is why those who suffer tend to sleep so much. It\u2019s escapism. Yet it isn\u2019t, because even in sleep you can be terrorized by your daytime demons. The quality of sleep is not restful \u2013 in fact, rather fitful. This is one reason so many people take mind-numbing tranquilizers to dull their wakeful state just to be able to drift away to somewhere, <em>anywhere </em>else than the dangerous and unchecked arena of the mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>People experience the tiers of depression's challenges in different ways. It\u2019s not being disappointed or being in a bad mood if something doesn\u2019t pan out in your favor. You chipped you manicure? Bugger. Irritating, yes, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. For a depressed person, &nbsp;something minor (for whatever reason) can hurl you head first into a bottomless void of regret and agony. You associate daily life with walking through a minefield. Danger lurks with every step. That ad for an antidepressant that shows a cartoon figure walking around under her own cloud of rain sums up the feeling quite well (of course it does \u2013 sponsored by The Pharmaceutical Cartel). You NEED this drug to function. That\u2019s another post, and I know far too well how drugs are touted as the magic solution. Not even children are safe from their campaigns.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/Brain1b12cc.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"705\"/></p>\n<p>It\u2019s the ultimate mind-fuck factory, this thought prison that leads you through Dante\u2019s circles of hell as you try to scramble your way out of the snake pit. The thoughts pull you back in by your ankles. Like a horror movie, the entity of depression knows what scares you. It knows what makes you wail in despair. It knows your saddest thoughts and flashes those across the movie screen in your head in incessant reruns. You are a spectator, but unable to avert your eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have things to do? Most can buck up and get 'er done. A very depressed person knows what must be done yet can\u2019t do it. Cannot. It\u2019s not possible. It has nothing to do with laziness and everything to do with apathy. The effort isn\u2019t worth it. You know you will feel better if such and such gets done. So the obvious solution is to do it. You have errands to run? Get in the car and go. But for a depressed person, the mundane becomes detestable to such an extent that not even the guilt for not doing the things is unable to motivate you enough to accomplish what is impossible in your mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/Blanche134386.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"698\"/></p>\n<p>Once while touring Alcatraz, I was struck by something the tour guide told us. The island is positioned in just the right way that all the prisoners could smell the Ghirardelli chocolate factory wafting its chocolate scent across the bay, no doubt driving inmates insane. This is much like depression. You are stuck in a jail cell knowing everyone else is living happily while you miss out on what you know (on some level) is a gift \u2013 life itself. You can only observe from afar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You know those days when you feel like a sloth and nothing gets done? For many depressed people that\u2019s every day. By getting nothing done I don\u2019t mean cleaning out the refrigerator or reading a book your friend needs back. I mean responsibilities you must accept as an adult, as a parent. You can\u2019t function. Your kids are hungry, but you can\u2019t do anything about it because you can\u2019t move. You have an empty stare and wonder if it\u2019s too early for a drink. It\u2019s only one in the afternoon. Can it be justified? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And you can\u2019t stop seeing those stories about the Yulin dog meat festival. This is horrible because an animal suffering is the worst thing in the world to me. Or those commercials by the SPCA. The thoughts hit hard, bating me. \u201cUh oh! She\u2019s making some progress \u2013 what is she sad about? Let\u2019s infect.\u201d Self-sabotage is the name of the game. For a depressed person, thoughts take over and pollute your whole mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You hope you will feel better tomorrow, or someday. You keep saying someday. But that wastes away today. You hide from friends and family because the idea of faking a smile is akin to torture. And you think no one cares about your problems. Or they are tired of hearing about them because they are always the same. &nbsp;&nbsp;Your brain is wired differently. Some of the most creative genius comes from a desolate mental state. It can, but only If you can get any mental energy together to be productive. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your friends email you cures for migraines. You have had to invent numerous excuses that involve having them, because that\u2019s a reasonable excuse to cancel plans. Saying you\u2019re sad or not in the mood will get \u201cI\u2019ll cheer you up\u201d from well-meaning friends and family. But you want to be alone, completely isolated, in bed, with the covers pulled up over your head. And you want to cry. And I don\u2019t mean a few tears. I mean heart-wrenching sobs that no one would want to hear. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You yell at people you love. You cry easily. They can\u2019t help you but they can sure piss you off. And we are pissed at ourselves, because children have needs that must be met -no question about it. And you know are letting them down with your suffering. Another blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;We do not feel sorry for ourselves in the traditional sense. We do feel sorry that we can\u2019t get a grip as we are often told to do. We feel guilty for letting others down who matter as they stand by helpless, completely befuddled about their roles in all of this. They feel responsible You want to convey it\u2019s not them or their fault, but they start to not believe you. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. It simply is. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some days are easier than others. I often do well when the stars align - deceptively so, or maybe not deceptive. Maybe I am getting a handle on this curse. It\u2019s a constant roller coaster of wondering when the happy cart will upturn and everything you manage to put in there (composure, self-esteem, productivity) scatters across the road. And cars are coming, but you have to try to summon up the ability to put them back in and continue on your journey. It\u2019s like you are that one slow car on a hill that everyone zips past because they don\u2019t carry the burden of your load. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Is life a beautiful thing? Yes. It is. Is it filled with sadness? Yes to that too. Can a depressed person overcome depression? I think so. But in order to answer that, you must be willing to look at your origins to discover what might be holding you back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/HeadlessHoreseman96dd9.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"822\"/></p>\n<p>Drawings and painting \u00a9 Johanna Westerman 2016 &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

My acquaintances who repeatedly travel abroad advised me to go to one of hot countries and to try diving there.\nSo, here is it, my long-awaited leave, and sky-blue waves and active vacation were already waiting for me.

In the video I focus mostly on my breath. Why is that? I have heard from many yoga teachers:\n> \"You can be practicing the poses of yoga, but if your breath is not aligned with your actions then you are not in yoga. You can also just be doing a daily task such as gardening,  and if your breath is aligned with your actions then you are in yoga.\"\n\nI love starting my morning with sun salutations, as it allows my body to wake up and my breath to fall in synch with my movements. Proper breathing while practicing sun salutations provides me with a grounding and energizing wholeness. If you can, I recommend doing sun salutations underneath the morning sun, as this allows you to feel the sun's radiating energy (and a little bit of Vitamin D never hurt anyone!). Without further ado, let's begin saluting the sun!\n\n---\n\n---\n\n<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MhksyzP_7K8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n\n---\n\n---\n\n1) Tadasana - Mountain Pose\n\n<center>![](https://s18.postimg.org/w401xk6mh/Screen_Shot_2016_09_12_at_3_53_34_PM.png)</center>\n\n**Inhale and exhale.** Stand in mountain pose, arms by your side, feet grounding into the earth. \n\n---\n\n2) Urdhva Hastasana - Upward Salute\n\n<center>![](https://s18.postimg.org/b8drmbafd/Screen_Shot_2016_09_12_at_3_53_58_PM.png)</center>\n\n**Inhale.** Reach your arms up to the sky, going into a little backbend here if it feels good. \n\n---\n\n3) Uttanasana - Standing Forward Bend\n\n<center>![](https://s18.postimg.org/6b07178g9/Screen_Shot_2016_09_12_at_3_54_19_PM.png)</center>\n\n**Exhale.** Swan dive forward, folding over your legs.\n\n---\n\n4) Ardha Uttanasana - Standing Half Forward Bend\n\n<center>![](https://s18.postimg.org/5ziqofs09/Screen_Shot_2016_09_12_at_3_54_32_PM.png)</center>\n\n**Inhale.** With a flat back, come up halfway.\n\n---\n\n5) Uttanasana - Standing Forward Bend\n\n<center>![](https://s18.postimg.org/6b07178g9/Screen_Shot_2016_09_12_at_3_54_19_PM.png)</center>\n\n**Exhale.** Bend forward, folding over your legs once again.\n\n---\n\n6) Chaturanga Dandasana - Four-Limbed Staff Pose\n\n<center>![](https://s18.postimg.org/ne2ywpp55/Screen_Shot_2016_09_12_at_3_54_49_PM.png)</center>\n\n**Retain Breath** - Step back into plank position and lower down, keeping your elbow close to your body. \n\n---\n\n7) Urdhva Mukha Svanasana - Upward Facing Dog\n\n<center>![](https://s18.postimg.org/6rq01dll5/Screen_Shot_2016_09_12_at_3_55_03_PM.png)</center>\n\n**Inhale** - Push away from the earth with your palms, arching your back up to the sky.  \n\n---\n\n8) Adho Mukha Svanasana - Downward-Facing Dog\n\n<center>![](https://s18.postimg.org/sfeybtlzd/Screen_Shot_2016_09_12_at_3_55_16_PM.png)</center>\n\n**Exhale** - Bring your hips up to the sky, your heels down to the ground, pushing through all corners of your feet and hands, letting go of your head.

If you didn't catch my last posts, I am creating a new tag #anwen-meditates to post my own health videos and tutorials. I am creating a Steemit health channel - all of my videos and tutorials are for the wonderful users of Steemit! I am planning on sharing many tutorials, including yoga, guided meditations, breathing exercises, and more. I am also uploading the videos to YouTube in the hope of attracting more users to Steemit.*\n\n*I have been practicing yoga and meditation for 8 years now, and these practices have been critical in shaping who I am today. My constant practices have brought me inner peace and stability during crazy times, have healed physical and emotional injuries, and have taught me how to be PRESENT!*\n\n*I am really excited to be able to share these practices with you all. I am first going to share tutorials and videos that you can do right now, wherever you are. These can be used as breaks from the information overload of Steemit / life in general, when you wake up, before you go to bed, or really any time at all. I hope you enjoy :-)*",

    "body": "In [yesterday's episode](https://steemit.com/story/@ericvancewalton/alarm-clock-dawn-an-original-novel-episode-28) Adam narrowly escaped retribution for the horrific role he played (or plays?) in the future as architect of *The New Prosperity movement.*\n\nMarcus could easily have ended Adam\u2019s life in the broom closet but instead saw the innocence and the sincerity in Adam\u2019s eyes. \n\nAdam vowed to do everything in his power to insure he wouldn\u2019t play a role in the global catastrophe that Marcus so convincingly described. At that moment Marcus made a split-second decision to both trust him and to spare Adam\u2019s life. The question that we\u2019ve yet to discover\u2026*was this a wise choice?* \n\nMarcus and Adam also attempted a bold escape from XenTek headquarters.  Today we will learn the outcome of their heroic efforts. \n\nWelcome to today's episode of Alarm Clock Dawn!\n\n---\n \n<center> *Did you miss Episode 28 of Alarm Clock Dawn? If so [click here](https://steemit.com/story/@ericvancewalton/alarm-clock-dawn-an-original-novel-episode-28) to catch up.* </center> \n\n<center> Are you new to Alarm Clock Dawn? If so [click here](https://steemit.com/story/@ericvancewalton/alarm-clock-dawn-an-original-novel-part-1) to start at the beginning. </center>\n\n---\n\n<center> ![](https://s16.postimg.org/hgaadldv9/image.png) </center>\n\n---\n\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Adam whispered as Marcus pushed open one side of the double door and began walking. Adam looked down at his vintage watch and began counting as the second hand  ticked around the dial too slowly.  He was afraid the fear would paralyze him right where he stood.  Adam mouthed out the final digits of his countdown\u2014*eighteen, nineteen, twenty*\u2014then took a quick and shallow breath and pushed open the door.  He walked past the guards at the front security desk as nonchalantly as possible and scanned his I.D. card. As the scanner beeped, the guard looked down at his monitor. Adam walked straight through the scanner and continued as fast as he could towards the stairwell. \n\nAdam\u2019s legs nearly collapsed as three final deafening gunshots rang out followed by a symphony of screams.\n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/13tdn6cyIq4B7W.gif) </center>\n\nJust as he made his way through the commotion and into the stairwell he caught a glimpse of Marcus laying in the skyway, motionless on the ground. A pool of Marcus' blood grew, almost completely obscuring the word \u201cSeclorum\u201d that was inlaid into the floor tile of the skyway. Marcus\u2019 body was surrounded by a gathering number of metro police and a member of the XenTek security team smiling as he talked on his satellite radio. \n\n*What a brave soul,* Adam said to himself as he raced down the stairwell to the station as fast as the adrenaline coursing through his veins could carry him. As luck would have it, a train was just pulling into the station. \n\nHe went through the turnstile designated Green, ducked in the open door of the closest train car, and quickly slid into a seat in the back. A handful of passengers boarded and the train pulled away swiftly from the station. \n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/6v0FAmeqcJsoE.gif) </center>\n\nAs the adrenaline began to subside, Adam became more intune with his surroundings. His whole body still felt numb and his psyche was in absolute shock at the horror of what he had just experienced. He closed his eyes and immediately vowed to make it his own personal mission to alter the course of the dreadful future Marcus had described to him just a few minutes ago in the lab. It was the least he could do, after all. Marcus had just made the ultimate sacrifice for him.\n\nAs the train whisked him further and further away from XenTek headquarters, Adam was deeply immersed in thought. What would his next move be? One thing was for sure: he knew he wouldn't have long to gather his things before the police put it all together and swarmed his apartment. The faster he could escape the city and get to the safety of the camps, the better. The police rarely stepped foot inside the homeless camps. To the authorities these people were less than human and deserved the day-to-day struggles they endured.\n\nAdam glanced up at the electronic news banner that ran along the top of the train car. \n\n*Yet to be identified fugitive shot dead just minutes ago at XenTek headquarters. This dangerous fugitive is suspected of kidnapping and murder. More news is sure to come in this developing story* . . . .> \n\nAll Adam could do was shake his head at the absurdity and glance out the window of the swaying train car, thinking about how truly strange the last few hours had been. As the day's events replayed in his head, he felt today was just a glimpse of a quickening that had come over his life. Adam knew the threshold he crossed today had set in motion a chain of events that he now had very little control over. \n\nJust then he witnessed a very rare occurrence. The slate gray clouds parted to reveal the most beautiful patch of bright sapphire sky. \n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/xql47YSMTze80.gif) </center>\n\nAdam took this as a good omen. Despite the horrible events that took place in the last few hours, this almost felt like an affirmation, a reminder from the universe that things were unfolding exactly as they were meant to. Just as he had this thought, Adam felt a tingling in his body and felt goosebumps raise on his arms. \n\nIn this surreal moment he thought to himself, *No matter how gray and violent the storms can be down here in the world, it is always serene, sunny, and blue above those clouds.* In a strange way, he instinctively realized he would revisit this single moment many times throughout the rest of his days, whenever he needed comfort.\n\nAdam felt a vibration in his pocket signaling he had a new message on his Holo.\n\nVerbalTag7 - *Adam. VERY urgent. Please answer.*\n\nAH_Bliss - *Yes, are you okay?*\n \nVerbalTag7 - *They've dispatched the entire police force to find you. Follow my instructions very carefully, to the letter. There isn't time to explain.*\n\nAH_Bliss - *Okay, what's wrong?*\n\nVerbalTag7 - *Ikeda's camp is just ten miles to the northwest of the city at the base of a huge red rock formation called Bell Rock. Look for the colored prayer flags strung across the trees. And Adam, waste no time getting here.*\n\nAlthough Adam was terrified at the sheer uncertainty of his situation, for a brief second this short message made him forget all horrible things that had just happened at XenTek headquarters. \n\nVerbalTag7 - *Are you there?*\n\nAH_Bliss - *Yes. I'm on the train headed back to my apartment to pick up just a few things.*\n\nVerbalTag7 - *If you do exactly as I say it will buy you an hour before they figure out where you are. If you don't, you have minutes. Erase everything on your Holo, and tuck it, along with you your C.ID badge under the seat of the train before your stop. Also, buy nothing. They can track your purchases too.*\n\nAH_Bliss - *W-wait, how do you know I'm in trouble?*\n\nVerbalTag7 - *Adam, there's no time. I'll explain later. For Godsake, please hurry. Do. Exactly. As. I. Say.* \n\n\n\n---\n\n<center> ![](https://s18.postimg.org/9phdrughl/TBC.png) </center>\n\n---\n\n*Alarm Clock Dawn is the first novel of a trilogy.

    "body": "When I was 6 or 7, there was a park off a winding road themed for Hansel and Gretel. It had a \"gingerbread\" play house and a pile of stones in the style of an oven. I loved that park. It was always deserted and I thrived alone. \n\nWe found it by accident, Mother and me, on a long drive. She had pulled off a split highway so I could squat near the tall grasses. She followed the road around a little ways, and there was the swingset with posts that were painted to looked like pretzels and seats that resembled chocolate rectangles.\n\n<center> (https://anonmgur.com/up/51fe599d56c57820cccd044a6bcbdfd8.jpg) </center>\n\nWe returned the next week with a picnic. Mother took me after school. Each visit I would unclick my seatbelt and fly from the car to the swings to \"kick the clouds.\" \n\nFrom the vantage point of now, maybe 30 years since the last visit, the park memories are surreal. They appear more like a memory mirage than reality. The feeling, though--that sense of safety and complete satisfaction with life. I can't shake it. \n\n### I want it back.\n\nI want to feel the freedom of kicking of my shoes and my toes kissing the sky.\n\n<center> (https://anonmgur.com/up/a24981aedfe263aec110c6c2caf45b9b.jpg) </center>\n\nI want to pack a lunch and sit in the sun not worrying what is next or whether I should be there.\n\nI want to feel the strength of my body--enjoy the magnificent rush of my stomach dropping away as I fall voluntarily through the air. \n\nThere was a lightness to life once. I want to relocate it. I want to slip the weight of negative memories from my shoulders and rise. \n\nLike the time I went around and around on the rusty carousel at the park. I called it the witch's carousel. It was wobbly and groaned when it got going. I spun so fast I lost my footing and flew off the edge, landing near where the sand box once lay. It hurt. I felt betrayed. I was caught in my own imagination. The slight was not true. No witch had cast a curse my way. Yet I cried furious tears until Mother packed me home.\n\n<center> https://anonmgur.com/up/f5d73bb02cadeb85209b1fb32c84dca5.jpg </center>\n\nMy mother asked about the game I was playing. In other words, she tried to ferret out the story I had created about the fall. \n\nI have been looking for the stories I created about the person who hurt me. They are the opposite of the witch. I created, with his help, a fantasy that his actions and words came from a place of love. There was no witch on the carousel. There was no love in my ex's heart. Not for me. \n\nI do not like seeing the way I slid into mistreatment, but lifting the veil offers me clarity. It is progress.\n\n### I am swinging closer to the sun every day.\n\nxoxo,\n## Dani",

    "body": "Perspective is everything\n\nThanks to @perspective and her blistering post here: https://steemit.com/life/@perspective/the-witch-s-carousel I\u2019ve just thought up some new content. It\u2019s wonderful how life falls into your lap sometimes it\u2019s just awesome.\n\nLife is awesome. See what I did there? Hah!\n\n---\nSo you know me by now as an addict, I\u2019ve yet to talk about my drug abuse, but it\u2019ll come. But I\u2019ve had some shitty times I kid you not.\n\nhttps://s17.postimg.org/9w1cqz1zj/man_69287_960_720.jpg\n\nThere was the time I stole money from my mate\n\nThat was fun\n\nOh, and the time that I stole money from my housemate,\n\nThat was fun too.\n\nAll to fund my drinking habit mind you. It was always to go out and get pissed.\n\nNever for the humanitarian efforts in Africa.\n\nGod no. Alcoholism is such a selfish addiction.\n\nOh, and then there was the time I had my Mum in tears because I was having alcohol fuelled parties over at her house\n\nThat was fun too\n\nMan, life was just one big fun party to me. It was totally awesome\n\nThen there was the time I emptied my step-mum\u2019s penny jar to get alcohol,\n\nhttps://s13.postimg.org/mjgp1mv7r/pennies_15727_960_720.jpg\n\nOh and don\u2019t forget the times I told Dad I\u2019d be back and never came, countless times, even on Christmas Day would you credit it.\n\nSee, I lived with Dad for a while too.\n\nBut that\u2019s another story.\n\nLife was there to serve me. People were there to be used, and taken for granted.\n\nI was a user.\n\nSadly I couldn\u2019t exist as a user for long. Because I would eventually use up all my options.\n\nMy friends would give up on me, I would turn to alcohol and lose my job,\n\nI would end up broke, jobless, friendless and penniless..\n\nOh, wait, that did happen to me.\n\nI couldn\u2019t see past it. Life was shit. It always had been. No-one cared, only I did. You need to look after yourself in life.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have it, you take it.\n\nhttps://s10.postimg.org/lrvrm4jqx/25177209554_5ab63b6a77_b.jpg\nImage Attribution: https://flic.kr/p/EmPMeU\n\nLife owes me everything, I\u2019d think.\n\nYOU owe me everything. Yes, YOU. Every, damn, thing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I finally sought help that I changed, and yes, some of the shit I went through was excruciatingly tough,\n\nBut I made it,\n\nUs humans are tougher than you think, you know.\n\nI learned out there, that there are people that care. My Manager, she always said to me that she wouldn\u2019t be there if she didn\u2019t get paid,\n\nBut she cared,\n\nYou could tell that she cared.\n\nAnd I spent my time in solitude (yesterday\u2019s story), (https://steemit.com/life/@lifeisawesome/we-all-need-some-love-in-our-hearts)\n\nAnd from there my attitude changed.\n\nI actually face worse in life now than I did all those years ago,\n\nIn fact, not much has changed apart from taking on a family, bills and responsibilities\n\nhttps://s21.postimg.org/s1gs4ez13/Family_Portrait.jpg\n\nI had none of that back then,\n\nBut I remain positive.\n\nCould you just imagine how my life would be if I had the attitude as I did as a youngster?\n\nYep, you guessed it, probably dead.\n\nSo the next time you say,\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never be happy\u201d\n\nThink about what you like about yourself, and work on those\n\nAnd what you hate? (don\u2019t lie!) Work on those too.\n\nApologise to those that need apologising to\n\nPick up the phone, tell someone you love them,\n\nhttps://s13.postimg.org/iwo6vkv9j/9645066390_babd98c3f1_b.jpg\nImage Attribution: https://flic.kr/p/fGiud7\n\nTake yourself out somewhere \u2013 by Christ you\u2019ve needed it!\n\nBinge watch your favourite TV show. What? You deserve it!\n\nDo more of what you love\n\nAnd work on what you hate\n\nAnd please,\n\nBe fucking AWESOME, friends.",

In real life they are definitely not the most pleasant thing to touch and being surrounded with.\n\nIt wasn't a surprise for me but jellyfish don't have brains. Instead, they have nerve nets which sense changes in the environment and coordinate the animal's responses.\n\nHowever if you eliminate all of the fluff that people are talking about them, you can come up with something interesting and even fun.\n\nThis drawing is created using my favorite style, I hope you'll love it.\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish2_zpswbrk9ied.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish3_zpsx0rcjvko.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish1_zpsge408hgu.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish4_zpsmctahaql.jpg\n\n***\n\n### <center>  Follow me for my future art work: [@tanyabtc](https://steemit.com/@tanyabtc) </center>",

    "body": "<a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/1jAgT\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/True-Unity-Based-in-Morality71c9e.jpg\" alt=\"True-Unity-Based-in-Morality71c9e.jpg\" /></a>\n\nThe degree of truth, especially **Moral Truth**, that is embodied in each of our choices, actions and behaviors will determine the degree of **True Unity, True Freedom and True Peace** we can achieve collectively. Morality is the *foundational baseline* for True Unity. All other differences are less significant. If we are more united with the moral truth of how to act and behave towards others, then we will be creating a more moral way of life. \n\nUntil we reach a certain level of comprehension of morality, unite with it in our thoughts, emotions and actions, we will not be able to truly create, lasting, effective freedom, peace and unity with each other. Morality is the key to opening a **higher, realer and truer authentic** way of life. Morality is the Way and the Path, the Light that will lead us away from darkness. We must delve deeper into moral comprehension. \n\nMorality leads to greater Wisdom of Right-Action which lift us up. Right-actions support a higher consciousness way of life. Connection to Moral Truth is real **knowledge, clarity, freedom and anarchy** to live our lives *free from master-slave dominating relationships* with others. This is being a **higher, realer and truer self.** This is living a **connected, united, integrated, and consistent way of life**.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/1jIS0\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Unity-Consciousness91bb8.jpg\" alt=\"Unity-Consciousness91bb8.jpg\" /></a>\n\nViolations of *Moral Truth/Law* do not result in the production of True Freedom, Peace or Unity. **Violations, violence and aggression** to others who are innocent beings, will only beget, generate and produce division, enslavement or war. We can't unite with others who are less moral when we are more moral. We need to educate others through our words. We need to get others to understand morality and it's importance in our quality and condition of life so that we can actually unite on the same page and level of being.\n\n**Truth and morality are inherently divided from falsity and immorality.** Trying to force a united way of living when there is no aggregate unity in moral comprehension will not work. Trying to do this, to allow the immorality to continue around us for the sake of a false \"unity\", will only eat away and erode us from the inside. We can't be united with morality in our thoughts, emotions and actions, and live a connected and integrated life, if others around us are continuing to violate moral principles.\n\nIf we are divided from truth in reality, especially Moral Truth, we are in contradiction with how to live in unity, harmony, peace and freedom with others and will be creating immorality and falsity into the world, even if we are ignorant of what we are doing. Ignorance of morality has us living a **lower, falser and inauthentic unrealer** way of life. \n\nImmorality and falsity leads to greater **Foolishness of Wrong-Action which weighs us all down**. Wrong-actions **burden** us and keep us living in *lower consciousness ways of life*. Disconnection from Moral Truth has us living in **ignorance, confusion, control and chaos** that prevents us from living up to our potential, where we instead live as *falser, unrealer and lower selves*.\n\nTrue Unity, true \"oneness\", is based in being united and at one with the Moral Truth. If we are divided from the Moral Truth, we are not at one with it, and we are not at one with other beings who have the right to be free from us *harming, violating and enslaving* them. This is living a **disconnected, disunited, disintegrated, inconsistent and contradictory way of life.**\n\nUltimately, we are also *not at one with ourselves, our potential truer, realer and higher selves, to act in accordance with a higher will-power within us*, that can lead us to *create a better world for ourselves and others*. The Path and Way of truth and light, of Moral Truth, is *not quick and easy*. It has **hardship and tribulations**. It is **strict and narrow in focus of dedication and arduous effort, not a wide array of convenience, ease, comfort, amusement, gratification, enjoyment and pleasure seeking.** It requires **Care for Moral Truth** and being devoted to upholding and bearing these *higher principles in life*, rather than seeking to live in baser carnal \"feel-good\" pleasure infatuations with ourselves.  \n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/75DZi\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/03/maat-44484741649db4c3.md.jpg\" alt=\"maat-44484741649db4c3.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></a></center>\n\nTruth and morality is not a heavy weight to bear, it is **Light** as a **feather** and lifts us up to have us soar and fly higher, just as the **Sun** rises to higher consciousness living. The sun, light and truth feeds our higher consciousness living, granting us the [symbolic \"after life\", \"eternal life\", and \"immortality\" of living in a \"heaven\" and \"paradise\"](https://steemit.com/symbolism/@krnel/magic-maat-and-morality-the-power-of-consciousness-pt-3). Truth, morality, justice, authenticity and realer living is symbolized as the [Feather of Maat](https://steemit.com/symbolism/@krnel/magic-maat-and-morality-the-power-of-consciousness-pt-3) which is used as the **[measure](https://steemit.com/symbolism/@krnel/thoth-thought-the-great-magician-the-power-of-consciousness-pt-4)** of our lives, that we **judge, insult and offend** ourselves by failing to **balance** ourselves with it.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/keytoknowledgeec5e1.png\" alt=\"keytoknowledgeec5e1.png\" border=\"0\"></center>\n\n**Moral Truth/Law is the key to the higher knowledge of higher living, the knowledge of the Wisdom of Right-Action. We can't create real, lasting good, freedom, peace, anarchy and unity, if we are not aligned on the same moral page/level and are allowing immorality to continue to be lived by ourselves or others. Moral truth shines a light on the darkness of our way of life.**\n\nWhere we put our **time, energy and attention** into, is what we will get more of. **Time is limited in life. Truth takes time. What way of life are we creating?** Do we want more base carnal pleasure and self-gratification to \"feel-good\" about ourselves? Or do we want to put lower consciousness focuses aside and instead seek to elevate ourselves and all of humanity to a higher way of life based in understanding and living Moral Truth? The choice is ours.\n\n----\n#### Thank you for reading! I appreciate the knowledge reaching more people. Take care.

Don't forget to follow :)\n\nThe Earth is unique amongst the terrestrial planets in having a large satellite, the Moon, which, relative to the Earth, has the largest mass of any satellite-parent system. Numerous lines of evidence indicate that the Moon was derived from the Earth as the result of a singular impact event soon after the initial formation of the Earth. As a result, the subsequent evolution of the Earth and the emergence and development of life has been strongly influenced by the presence of the Moon.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/w2VnAiE.png\n\n#pointilism\n#art\n#design\n#holiday",

    "body": "<html>\n<center>http://picload.org/image/rdgciapg/comparecover0.jpg</center><br>\n<p>Everybody does it. Some people less, some people more.</p>\n<h3>We compare ourselves to others.</h3>\n<p>And although we've heard countless times not to do that, and that we should \"just be ourselves\" - we still do it sometimes. And it can be quite a burden. The envy destroys our own self-esteem!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>These are all thoughts that creep inside our head:</p>\n<p><em>\"How do I get this person to like me, and be friends with me?\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"How would people react if I acted a little less serious?\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Can I really wear this tonight, or what will the others think?\"</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We think so much about how other people see us or if they like us, because <strong>it's an instinct of humans to want the respect and recognition from others.</strong><br>\nBut now, in the modern age, the pressure is even higher than ever before - nowadays it seems like everybody is competing with someone because of their job, status, money, house, car etc.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/12FcOl0iLH7c2Y/giphy.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"/></center></p>\n<p><strong>This means that there is always someone better than you.</strong><br>\nThere is always someone with a nice car,<br>\nsomeone with a nicer house,<br>\nsomeone with a better job and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We constantly compare ourselves, and as soon as we feel like we have less than someone else, our self-esteem lowers. And at the same time, this makes us appreciate the things we <em>do</em> have less and less.</p>\n<h2>Less and less people are feeling truly happy, while more and more people think they need to buy luxurious, material goods to achieve happiness.&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><center>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/31/6a/e9/316ae949a2c2196c0552e00f94fbebe8.jpg</center></p>\n<p>We think to ourselves that we have to buy or achieve \"something particular\" and only then we allow ourselves o be happy.</p>\n<p>And the problem is that once we have finally bought something better than our 'competitor', someone else pops up and owns something <em>even</em> better.<br>\nSo we chase after happiness as if we were on a treadmill, but never actually achieve happiness. (This is also called the Hedonic Treadmill!)</p>\n<h3>And when we are chasing after that new car or fancy watch, we are actually really chasing the feeling of being liked and respected.</h3>\n<p>If we really want to grow our self-esteem, we can only<strong> reduce our expectations at ourselves,</strong> instead of chasing after success and money even more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/dd/9d/29/dd9d29e8be39e69fd6bc1533103041e0.jpg</center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>So what can we do to actually get those feelings of respect and recognition from others?<br>\nWe should work on ourself and chase after improving our own character.<br>\nWe should work on being more kind, confident, satisfied, grateful and mindful.</p>\n<h3>And we should respect ourselves for that.</h3>\n<p>Yes, the respect from others will follow then.</p>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h2>Here are some tips that help you to stop comparing yourself to others:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Stop begrudging someone their success.<br>\n</strong>This may be difficult to execute at first, but just try reminding yourself that that person deserves it as well, and that you're happy for them. It has nothing to do with you.</li>\n  <li><strong>Accept that you are not perfect.</strong><br>\nAnd you will never be. You are still a work in progress and as long as you keep wanting to improve yourself, there is nothing to feel bad about.</li>\n  <li><strong>Analyze yourself.</strong><br>\nFor a few days, be mindful of your own behaviour and detect whenever you are comparing yourselves to others. Then, ask yourself what triggered this behaviour, and what would have been a better way to react.</li>\n  <li><strong>Appreciate what you have.</strong><br>\nGratitude is one of the most important, yet one of the most forgotten values nowadays. Especially now that everyone is in a contest with someone else, you need to be grateful for what you already have, and don't overlook it while constantly chasing after <em>more</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><center>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/6e/25/27/6e25272b3dadecf6521b94b379beccb5.jpg</center></p>\n<h3>Instead of thinking of other people, focus on what's really important in your life. Your goals, your passion.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>What do you want to do? How would you like to become? <strong>Focus on it!</strong><br>\nAnd if you decide to give this your all, you will be so busy you don't even have time to compare yourself to others!</p>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2>Think about it this way:</h2>\n<p><strong>Picture a meadow with hundreds of different flowers.</strong><br>\nSome are bright and colorful, others small and delicate.<br>\nSome grew in the bright sunlight, others in the shadow of the trees, and other between the rocks.</p>\n<h3>All these flowers are different. And how could you ever compare them?</h3>\n<p>They have grown in all different conditions, and some would never grow larger or more colorful than others.</p>\n<h2><center>... And that's okay.</center></h2>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/TlDdgIsop5FNm/giphy.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><hr><br>\n- <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sirtonywinchester/\">Instagram -</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/397766613731804/\">- Steemit FB Group -&nbsp;</a></p>\n<a href=\"https://steemit.com/@sirwinchester\"><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://picload.org/image/rrpgppid/followbtn.gif\"/></a>\n<p><em><strong>\u00a9 Sirwinchester</strong></em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

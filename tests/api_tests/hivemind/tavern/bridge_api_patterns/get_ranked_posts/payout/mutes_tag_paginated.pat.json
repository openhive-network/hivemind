    "body": "<center>![](http://svmassagetherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slumpshoulder.jpg)</center>\nHappy Friday Steemit, this is a continuation of my story in which I talk about what I did to correct my posture.  The last post I did covered Deadlifts and the benefits I gained from it, if you missed that one you can read it [here](https://steemit.com/life/@ayim/fixing-posture-part-1-deadlifts).  In this post I will write about static holds to improve the lower portion of the body. \n***\n<center> <h2> Isometric holds </h2> </center>\n<center>![](https://www.t-nation.com/img/photos/2012/12-716-04/jason-statham.jpg)</center>\n\nIsometric holds are great for stability and for building strength. These exercises are super friendly for people who just started working out and it can modified to be challenging for advanced athletes. I believe everyone should be doing some sort of isometric holds incorporated with their exercise routine. Its low impact, highly challenging, and it can be done anywhere.\n\n### Isometric Training\n\nIt can be applied anywhere, with weights or not, the main idea of isometric training is to slow it down. I see a lot of personal trainers not really showing their clients these exercises which I think its odd because their clients are normally beginners and not fully aware of their own motor skills. Doing isometric exercises will help people understand the muscles being used in each movement. Lets test it out, try doing a slow squat for 5-10 seconds each way, lower yourself until your hips are slightly below your knee and come back to standing position. You should probably feel which part of your leg is activated throughout the motion.\n\n### Routine \n* Squats (3-5 reps of 5-10 seconds )\n* Lunges (3- 5 reps of 5-10 seconds)\n* V-sits (3-5 reps of 10-60 seconds)\n* Planks (3-5 reps of 10-60 seconds)\n* Bridge (3-5 reps of 10-60 seconds)\n<sup><strong>Rest only enough where you think you can complete the next rep in proper form.</strong> </sup>\n<strong>*Remember to breathe*</strong>\n\n---\nThis routine is to help stabilize the pelvis, where people normally have issues due to sitting too long in the chair.  Take proper rest, this routine might not make you sore or tired, but your CNS (central nervous system) fatigue is easily hidden. Treat it like weight training, take at least a day  or two off in between. \n<center><h3>V-sit</h3>\n![v-sit](http://burnit.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/V-sit-ups.jpg)</center>\n<center><h3>Plank Variations</h3>\n![plank](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/44/b1/7c/44b17ce0ae2425dfa3273b9d12981830.jpg)</center>\n\n<center><h3>Bridge Variations</h3>\n![v-sit](http://ignorelimits.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Bridge-Exercise-Progression.png)</center>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Yesterday I had a job interview in the city of <strong>Lincoln, UK</strong>. A veterinarian practice was looking for a Vet to introduce in a poultry specialist group. Those who are following my blog should know that I am not working since 1 month because I need to finish my post degree and I need to be focused on my study.</p>\n<p><strong>I have never worked as a vet in poultry farms;</strong> I did some <em>Salmonella </em>inspections but be a specialised poultry veterinarian is something that I have never considered.</p>\n<p>Anyway few days ago I received this call where a woman was asking me if I was available for an interview and I said yes of course.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two days ago I was reading a booklet I had from the previous job (just to refresh my knowledge before the interview).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_094909d4f68.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><strong>This is me and the booklet, ready for the interview :)</strong></p>\n<p>Lucky me, my girlfriend had a day off so we went together and my idea was... <em>\"let's do the interview.. and if I will not have luck, doesn't matter, I can see one of the nicest city in England\".</em></p>\n<p>I drove 120 miles and in 2.15 hours to be there!</p>\n<p>During the interview I wasn't stressed at all, I was laughing and making stupid jokes. One of the vets was coming from <strong>Cornwall</strong> and as you know I have been <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@webdeals/taking-steemit-to-the-end-of-the-land-land-s-end-cornwall-england-part-1\">there</a> 2 weeks ago, so I have something to talk about it :).</p>\n<p>The interview went very well ( I suppose ) and they told me that they will let me know by the end of the next week because they have other interviews and I said of course with a <strong>big smile</strong> on my face.</p>\n<p>At that point I didn't care about it... I had my chat/interview and now we were starving so, we drove directly to the city centre and we stopped in a restaurant called Zizzi, a chain restaurant where are serving Italian's food.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We had fritto misto ( mixed fried ) as starter, I had a massive pizza pepperoni and Kamila had pasta with I don't know what. We were starving so the only photo I have is about the starters LOL.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_142933c396c.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>We stand up after the meal like we were pregnant! </strong>So full that you cannot understand. We started looking around this city because in case I will get the job I should move there! Lincoln is a very nice city, medieval architecture, built on a hill with Cathedral and Castle on the top and all the buildings were going down till the marina that actually is an enlarged part of a river where you can find few boats.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_164620ea5e5.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_164615f653e.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1521455a385.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1523034e72d.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1530325adda.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1545139d2ca.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We went in the main street that was plenty of shops, we started watching the first, the second etc etc... till finally we arrived in front of a street where the slope was at least 45%. Was the only way to get to the castle so I we went there and once arrived my heart was tachycardic. In that moment there was a graduation day, all the students from Lincoln's University were coming out from the Cathedral that was closed to the visitors and were going into the Castle. Well we were well dressed because the interview so we followed these students and relatives so we went in the castle and <strong>we didn't pay</strong> any ticket LOL.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1600271b2ee.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_160052e1431.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_160542cf3b0.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>After that and after the long day we agreed to come back home completely tired looking forward to rest a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: once I was typing this post I have received a voice mail from the vet that would like to discuss about my &nbsp;interview but I tried to call him back and he is busy. Keep tuned and I will let you know ;).</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> THEY JUST CALLED ME TELLING THAT ARE GLAD TO OFFER ME THE POSITION AND THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ASAP IF I WILL BE PART OF THEIR TEAM</p>\n<h2>If you enjoyed my post feel free to follow me and to write me a comment. :)</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

My 2016 has been a series of intense and emotionally painful scenarios. Maybe I'll explain this further in a future article, but for right now, the gist of the story is that I fell into a massive depression between the months of March and August. It was Rock Bottom for me, and there were points during these months where I truly felt I was not going to make it out alive.  I began to close down emotionally, and completely isolated myself. Even my *best friend* did not hear from me for over five months. \n\nThe good news is that I don't feel like that anymore. As much as I truly wanted to lay down and give up, I somehow pushed through. I eventually realized that I was not living up to my full potential, and the situation I was in was <b>NEVER</b> going to let me live up to that potential. So I made drastic changes. I found some strength I unknowingly had, and <b>purged</b> the things in my life that didn't serve my greatest good. I basically chose to burn everything I knew down to the ground (metaphorically speaking) so I could build it up again; only better. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p206x206/14199692_10154425280802180_5749426944932582371_n.jpg?oh=9562a7c5a6d1c91aa15b215bb06b89ac&oe=583A9C22\"></center>\n\nCurrently everything is still in shambles, though, at least the fire is out. And once you realize you've burned everything down, you quickly become motivated to fix that. Rock bottom is a good place to be at times. I believe everyone will go through some sort of Rock Bottom at some point of their life as a test of strength and character. \n\n<center><h5>Just *how* strong are you? Are you going to wallow, or are you going to push through it? It's completely up to you. Personally, I chose to wallow for about two weeks, and then I got sick and tired of that, graciously picked myself up, and moved forward.</h5></center>\n\nWhy did I metaphorically burn everything to the ground? Why did I give up the life I was living? \n\nBecause the metaphoric foundation of this metaphoric house was built on metaphoric sand. It really offered nothing for me except the promise of working hard for someone else's dream (a great dream, but not my dream), and living in someone else's shadow for the rest of my life. And I was ok with that at first, because I didn't really see myself as worthy or deserving of anything more. \n\n<center><h3>And then I experienced Ayahuasca.</h3></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14141936_10154397735912180_6968112830431779711_n.jpg?oh=69513099f9a5b8c992037d17ba3b5a4b&oe=587FCB23\"></center> \n\nI am so grateful that I got to meet this mind-blowing medicine. I sat wrapped in a blanket overlooking the Ocean in Acapulco, Mexico fascinated with the fact that I had a body! I truly feel like I touched the core of my soul in a time span of seven hours. And once you touch the core of your soul, you recognize *just how beautiful and loving* (and <b>powerful</b> because of that) you truly are. I realized the light inside of me that burned so passionately was not supposed to be wasted.\n\nI understood this medicine more than I understood myself, and in that moment I realized just how important it was to share Ayahuasca with as many people as I could. I realized that I had a powerful voice, and if I talked loud enough, people would hear me. I <b>knew</b> in that ceremony that I was put on this earth to help assist in the healing of others' mental and emotional states. Am I the healer? No. The real healer is the sacred plant. I'd just help administer her. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p206x206/14233192_10154425322662180_7883334594280044695_n.jpg?oh=db3576234335e20913df775a5aadb296&oe=5845C4A4\"></center>\n\n<center><h3>*So the reason why I burned everything I knew, the reason why my life is literally unrecognizable, is to help in the process of healing our world; one individual at a time.*</h3></center> \n\nI truly believe that the Universe is evolving. We cannot push it faster than it is already moving. Obviously, the *Number 1* goal for anarchists is to end government. But I truly believe that will only happen when nearly everyone on earth has found inner peace. Without inner peace, there will be more tyranny, more war, more suffering. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p206x206/14291778_10154425312337180_5341636245782905790_n.jpg?oh=e6cc3c75705b19747f4e793aefc7f001&oe=587E3796\"></center>\n\nThat's why I believe psychedelics are keys to our mind's eternal library. All psychedelics can open various doors into your subconscious, but I feel Ayahuasca is the <b>*Master Key*</b>. She can open the deepest hidden doors to your psyche in a very gentle way. \n\n<center><h4>I want to see a world full of love, personal freedom, and potential. I burned everything down so I could devote my entire life to helping others find their true potential through the therapy of Ayahuasca. She shows you how beautiful it is to be human, and that this experience should not be wasted. If my life has to be in shambles for a temporary period so more people find their true potential and inner peace, *I'm totally okay with that*.</center></h4>\n<br>",

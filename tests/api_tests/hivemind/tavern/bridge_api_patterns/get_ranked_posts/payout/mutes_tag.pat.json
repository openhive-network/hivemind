    "body": "You are what your friends are.\n\nhttps://cdn.pbrd.co/images/19tOaDNQT.jpg\n\nLet\u2019s be honest here. I firmly believe that the energy you give out, yet get back in life. It\u2019s karma in a sense, but I don\u2019t believe in this invisible force.\n\nOnly that if you give out trust, openness, honesty and much happiness to others, then likeminded people will gravitate towards you.\n\nYour life force is like an energy. If you surround yourself in that energy people that enjoy basking in that type of energy will gravitate towards it.\n\nThat\u2019s why I meet a ton of supremely open and trustworthy people.\n\nI absolutely repel narcissists. I used to be a magnet for them, but I know their deadly secret. I know what they don\u2019t want anyone else to know.\n\nDepth.\n\nhttps://cdn.pbrd.co/images/19v3xPBBM.jpg\n\nA narcissist will never be able to apologise, or accept their mistakes. Anything less and they see it as a competition for top dog. But a narcissist will be able to point out the mistakes of everyone they meet.\n\nI don\u2019t like people that don\u2019t let me venture into their depths.\n\nAnd they hate me.\n\nSo everything\u2019s good.\n\nSo the same can be said if you\u2019re negative. I know I keep saying it, but if you\u2019re a negative person you\u2019ll meet other people that will want to bask in that energy too.\n\nI used to be an overtly negative person.\n\nMy friends would laugh at my achievements, make me feel as if I wasn\u2019t worth much, or put me down in front of other people. They were no friends at all.\n\nhttps://cdn.pbrd.co/images/19ytSjj2e.jpg\n\nThey were nice to me in private though. Because there\u2019s no competition\n\nThey may appear to be a friend, but that\u2019s just for show. Truth be told they like looking better than you.\n\nBut the hard truth is:\n\nYou are beautiful.\n\nThere is amazing in there, somewhere.\n\nI know because I see it in my comments, some quite defiantly say,\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no beautiful in me I think I never had it\u201d or something similar,\n\nYet perhaps you haven\u2019t met the right people yet to yank that the fuck out there for the world to see. Absolutely everyone has some sparkly awesome in them.\n\nI swear I haven\u2019t met a single person yet with no awesome that could be taken and sharpened to a fine point.\n\nhttps://cdn.pbrd.co/images/19zQKLn1k.jpg\n\nWhen my awesome started to surface every now and again I began to enjoy it. And it came to a point that I was mentally requesting my awesome daily to come out and play.\n\nUntil one day, it moved in with me.\n\nAnd this can be you too.\n\nIt all starts with you my friend.\n\nStart by leaving a nice message somewhere.\n\nYou guys are beautiful,\n\nThank you",

    "body": "<h1>The Evolution Of Virtual Economies And Their Future Global Impact On The World</h1>\n\nhttps://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/2/005/087/3c0/3e54334.jpg\n\nAnyone alive in the last twenty years has no doubt experienced the growth of the internet from a basic useful tool into a mammoth sized economic power that has thousands of use cases in our everyday life. However, had you been asked in the 90s if you thought the internet would evolve so rapidly and become such an integral part of our society\u2019s life, most would have scoffed. Many, even today, believe that the internet has stopped growing and most of the essential tools built for it have been created, but to me and others, who are taking notice of the innovation still happening in this space, it is clear this is just the beginning. I see the internet as a base layer of proof that virtual economies can exist and can work to provide livelihood to many around the world, but I see them evolving into something of a science fiction dream. I truly believe that within the next 100 years, we will have fully immersive, borderless and virtual economies that will dwarf the internet of today.\n\n<h1> Immersive Virtual Interconnectivity Between Humans And The Internet</h1>\n\nVirtual reality in the past few years has actually started to become a tangible reality that currently has some use cases, but the evolution of such systems will be the catalyst for a new paradigm in how we interact with the world and each other. The ultimate goal for virtual reality systems would be a system that provided the user immersive access to the internet directly to a point where their consciousness and the internet merge as one. Think of a matrix type of system that can be freely accessed from the comfort of your home, anywhere in the world. This complete immersion would quite literally create a second reality that one could live and interact with. Entire virtual worlds with access to all of our senses and feeling would be created to supply users with a boundless place to build only limited by creativity. With the creation and use of a device like this or something similar the following use cases would completely change the world into something unrecognizable to the people of today. Take in mind less extreme versions of this technology, without the merging of consciousnesses could also do the job, but im going to just assume the best case scenario for what could potentially be created.   \n\nhttps://a2ua.com/ai/ai-001.jpg\n\n<h1>Massive Borderless Labor Markets</h1>\n\nThe first and largest change that would take place would simply be having access to a global labor marketplace with jobs and opportunities presented to people, regardless of where or what country they reside. If decentralized and free of regulation, these markets would have free market pay and ideology prevail. However there is another option which would be to treat various virtual worlds like different countries with options to create governments and provide regulation in those worlds. As an employer or employee you would be able to pick and choose where you wanted to run your business or work depending on which virtual world suited your needs. No longer would you be burdened by which country or area you choose to live in the real world, when a massive job market is accessible virtually in your house.\n\nThe way companies would change in response to this new technology would be immense. The most competitive companies would now have access to the entire labor market which would include the most efficient and smartest workers from all over the world, which they would pay accordingly. Business overhead would potentially be less expensive as well because companies wouldn\u2019t need to house workers during the day in physical buildings, but rather digital ones that could be purchased for cheap. Lower business costs would mean higher profitability which would better economic wellbeing for the employees and in return the global economy as a whole.\n\nhttp://www.hypergridbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Matterport-VR.jpg\n\n<h1> Creation Of An Almost Completely Virtual Retail Economy</h1>\n\nIf we think about how much ecommerce has grown, and is still growing, since the inception of the internet, it is mind blowing. For many years ecommerce was a joke to people and most \u201ccritically acclaimed\u201d investors said it would never take off. Well, it did take off and now accounts for a giant portion of all international GDP. However, there is still something left to be desired with the online shopping experience that is available at in person retail stores. We as human beings still have a desire to touch, feel and most importantly try out products before we purchase them. With businesses that deal in products like clothing, perfume ect. we as consumers want to try the product before we buy it. With a completely virtual retail economy this could be achieved with virtual store fronts and the ability to try on a product before you buy it. Again, because of the lack of overhead for a small business running in one of the virtual worlds, the products would be less expensive and you know how they would fit when they were delivered to you in the real world. However, rather than just delivering you the product in the real world, you could be able to receive a copy in the virtual world as well. We already have a precedence set for virtual cosmetic items in MMORPGs and other multiplayer games. People will flock to the virtual retail economy because it provides them with a use case that is better than what we currently have.\n\n<h1>Virtual Real Estate Markets</h1>\n\nVirtual real estate markets also have a huge potential within the new virtual economies and worlds that will be created. Even though real estate would be able to be created relatively cheaply, storefronts, buildings and other locations that are considered prime real estate will be heavily demanded. There is a precedent set for this idea as well in an MMORPG called \u201cEntropia Universe\u201d , where one of the wealthier players purchased a space station and was able to make an income from it when other players would travel to new planets. Although completely virtual the property has had offers in the hundreds of thousands of dollars range. I foresee the same thing happening with real estate in the virtual worlds created, especially popular ones with millions of people accessing them. The idea of a virtual landlord would actually be feasible if someone was to purchase a lot of land and then rent it out. It would be like if each bitcoin created represented a plot of land and we were able to create buildings on that plot and rent it out. The possibilities with real estate are quite literally endless. Together with the creation of virtual worlds, the virtual real estate market would be massive.\n\nhttp://rebellion.nerdfitness.com/uploads/monthly_2016_04/57026c98a0b2e_Matrixchair.jpg.6fe1d4a62228cc05d0d4cf3348aaf616.jpg\n\nIn conclusion, many of the points I made here for a possible virtual economy might be seen as science fiction, which many of it is. However as we have seen with many technology before, technology inventions seem to stem from science fiction quite frequently. Who knows how different the world will be in 100 years. To put it in perspective, 100 years ago barely anyone was even using a radio, just think about what people 100 years in the future will be thinking about us. If my expectation for reality in the future does come true, I believe we will see what I have written about in the article take place.\n\n-Calaber24p",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>The purpose of life - an ancient question that humans have been discussing and wondering about for thousands of years.<br>\n<strong>Maybe it's even the most discussed question in history!</strong></p>\n<p>Well, essentially everybody has to determine their purpose in life for themselves.</p>\n<p>Maybe you feel unhappy with your current life situation, you don't have specific goals to chase or you don't know what to do with your life at all.<br>\nYou have to find your mission, your passion,<strong> your WHY!</strong> <em>The reason </em><em><strong>WHY</strong></em><em> you are doing what you're doing!</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://picload.org/image/rdggirri/whycover0.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Let's start with some Tips about Self-Discovery:</h2>\n<p><strong>1) Start off with a clear mind. </strong><br>\nGetting to know yourself and finding your passion isn't a short or easy task, and you won't be able to accomplish it if you're constantly worrying or being distracted by other things in your life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2) Get to know yourself. </strong><br>\nYou're probably thinking you already know that, but I'm talking about actually analyzing your thought patterns and behaviour. You can do that by asking yourself the RIGHT questions, for example: What are my values? What do I want to achieve in life? What stops me from doing that? What's my motivation?</p>\n<p><strong>3) Don't be distracted or discouraged by others. </strong><br>\nFinding your passion is something that's only YOUR business. Don't compare yourself to others, or be discouraged by their opinion. You are doing this for yourself and no one else.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Follow your heart. </strong><br>\nAs cheesy as it sounds - this is true. Listen to yourself, and what you enjoy doing. What's your passion? Is it an activity, an artform, or maybe something entirely different like helping people or creating something with your hands or exploring - whatever it is, follow your heart rather than your brain in this case. Don't think too much about it, just do what feels \"right\" to you.<br>\nAnd what if you have no idea what that is? Your passion is not always something you've been doing for years or something you're great at. But everybody has something they enjoy doing. Whatever it is, start from there and follow the path!</p>\n<p><strong>5) Don't put pressure on yourself. </strong><br>\nWhen you tell yourself \"I have to figure out what to do with my life\" and feel like you have to choose ONE thing only, you are only making the process harder for yourself. Finding your true passion is a process that can take several years, and it doesn't always have to be ONE specific thing only!</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/CjzOyCimZNpra/giphy.gif\" width=\"429\" height=\"322\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Okay, now you have found your passion, how do you get started and pursue it?</h2>\n<p>Take a piece of paper, and write down <strong>the goals you want to achieve with your passion in 6 months and in 1 year. </strong>Depending on your goal, these could be things like \"practice singing everyday and then participate in this competition\" or \"start my online business by designing a website\" or \"read a book every week and teach others about it\".&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>And then, write another list of things you can do RIGHT NOW to get started.</h3>\n<p>For our examples above, this could be \"Practice to sing Song XY\" or \"research marketing strategies for my online business\" or \"call someone today and help them with their problem\".</p>\n<h2><center><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l5qQbR8HFCIZa/giphy.gif\" width=\"718\" height=\"404\"/></center></h2>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2>You have found something and tried it out - how do you know if what you're doing is ACTUALLY your passion?</h2>\n<h3>Are you in <em>\"The Zone\"</em> when pursuing it?</h3>\n<p>Being in the Zone means that your work doesn't feel like work at all. You are so busy in the process, that time flies and you forget everything around you - your worries, the time, and sometimes I even forget to eat because being in the Zone means being so extremely focused. <strong>You are excited, productive and work quickly.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>This feeling has many different names and has been scientifically proven in different studies, it's also often called <strong>\"FLOW\"</strong> as described in the book by Mih\u00e1ly Csikszentmihalyi.</p>\n<h3>When you feel like this while working on your new passion/goal, you know that you have found something you truly enjoy - and only then you have the possibility to actually stick with it!</h3>\n<p>You will also know that you have found your true passion when you naturally feel like <strong>you want to do it.</strong> You wake up and are excited to start working on your new project, no one has to force you or give you an additional motivation to start.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEdv1vkhqxcynkB5C/giphy.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>What if you are afraid to fail?</h2>\n<p>First of all, failure is part of life. And as long as you learn from your mistakes, you never really \"fail\" anyway. <strong>You either win, or you lose, learn from it, try again, and THEN win.</strong></p>\n<p>Our society has taught us that mistakes are bad, and that failing is unacceptable.<br>\nBut you have to view mistakes from a different perspective!</p>\n<h3>Mistakes are simply signals from your environment, telling you: This is not the right way, you might want to try another one!</h3>\n<h2>Learn to view it as \"Feedback\" rather than \"Failure\"!</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://picload.org/image/rdggirra/b06abbc3bf68a6ad88dd82895c7d40.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3><center>Many people live life without ever finding their WHY, they just work and get older. They don't achieve their dreams because they don't have their WHY defined - their reason and motivation to do it!</center></h3>\n<h2><center>Find a WHY that's strong enough to keep you going, even when times get rough, and that still makes you enjoy the ride!</center></h2>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://picload.org/image/rdggirrl/endbild0.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\n- <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sirtonywinchester/\">Instagram -</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/397766613731804/\">- Steemit FB Group -&nbsp;</a></p>\n<a href=\"https://steemit.com/@sirwinchester\"><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://picload.org/image/rrpgppid/followbtn.gif\"/></a>\n<p><em><strong>\u00a9 Sirwinchester</strong></em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>I wrote a few days ago about always trying to fit in. Always choosing the things that fits what society tells me I should do rather than what I want to do. Oh, he\u2019s an attractive chap that likes sports. He needs to fit in with the \u2018in\u2019 crowd. So that was my slot. I\u2019d slot in where society told me like a little robot that I was.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/W3h5E4mI.jpg\" width=\"3888\" height=\"2027\"/></p>\n<p>Truth be told I\u2019d have rather hung out with the uber geeks. Where they\u2019d be talking about their newest adventure on their latest RPG. Or the newest thing to hit telly. Back in my day it was either Star Trek or Stargate SG-1. I just really wanted to sit at their table and talk geek.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But society told me that I shouldn\u2019t be sitting at their table, and that I should be sitting with the people that talk sports and chat to girls and care who said what to who about whom. It was all rather tiring. I didn\u2019t have enough time in the day about all that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And it followed me when I left High School, truth be told I thought it would end, but in true group fashion I somehow always ended up with the popular people. I never really wanted to but I had a face that fitted and a slender body to match. It\u2019s funny actually. How physical appearance weights a great deal on how you\u2019re perceived in this world. Some might deny it, but it\u2019s true. My greatest gift, yet equally my biggest flaw&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I thank society inwardly now. For making Facebook cool, for bringing all social media to the forefront and making it a regular day to day thing. I no longer have to hide my sordid little secret. And if I spent excessive amount of time on here then no-one bats an eyelid. It\u2019s awesome.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/W4VPkaQG.jpg\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\"/></p>\n<p>I can play games now, with my friends. And none of them will look at me as if I\u2019ve just wet farted in St Pauls when I ask them if they\u2019d like a multiplayer on Call of Duty, or Fifa, or something equally as heart stopping.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And no-one will look at me strange ever again when I talk to them about the good old days when I\u2019d use Match.com to try and find a potential lady friend. Everyone does that now, it\u2019s not seen as bat shit crazy like it used to be.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So I guess I finally slot in now. Not completely. I mean I\u2019ve came out the closet with my geekery, and my friends, they\u2019re just happy they have someone to fix their tech stuff when they need it, but I still get topics that go way over others head. At least they accept it now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally</p>\n<p>Have you ever had any experiences like such?</p>\n</html>",

I am an electronics engineer. So do you think that functioning of computers, computer programs and other office equipment is a secret for me?! Naturally NO!

    "body": "Here is a project I have been working on. The name of the organization is Project MIA which stands for my independent address. The project is about living off the grid with a focus on green energy. I designed the logo, a brochure and a promotional item. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/pjyIi8E.jpg\n\nThe logo consists of the elements that make up living off of the grid. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/CY6ivZC.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ykCNU8d.jpg\n\nThe brochure tells all of the benefits of green energy and also the negatives. I like to show both point of views when looking at something. My goal is not to sell you on green energy, it is to inform you about it and then you can make your own decision as whether to use it or not.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9VZyR54.jpg\n\nMy promotional item is a set of coasters. The idea is to give your drink its \"own grid.\" I plan to make a promotional item and brochure for each aspect of the initial logo. This is the first element, green energy.  Thanks for viewing! Don't forget to follow.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1PJY77K.jpg\n\nRenewable Energy creates three-times more jobs than fossil fuels.\nFossil fuels get 4 times the subsidy of renewables.\nRenewable energy is expected to jump to 25 percent of global gross power generation in 2018, a rise on 20 percent in 2011 and 19 percent in 2006.\nOne wind turbine is able to generate enough electricity to power up to 1,400 households.\nWithin a 5-year period, Portugal\u2019s electric grid jumped from 15 percent to 45 percent renewables.\nIf taken advantage of to its fullest extent, sunlight that beams on the earth for one hour could meet world energy demands for an entire year.\nEurope and North Africa could run on 100% renewable energy by 2050.\nIn 2014, China built two wind turbines per day.\nSolar power may account for the world's main energy source of power by 2050.\n20% of the UK's population live in areas suitable for Geothermal District Heating using heat pumps.\n\nSource: https://www.ovoenergy.com/blog/green/10-fun-facts-about-renewable-energy.html\n\n#design\n#art\n#green\n#news",

It\u2019s been a very rewarding experience for me to see how much interest there is in this project. Others outside of our Steemit community have been introduced to this community through this series as well, and some are expressing interest in getting involved with the project.</p>\n<p>We end this series with an idea on how to pursue the regeneration of La Gon\u00e2ve. While I can make the time, it\u2019s difficult for me to make the trips to Haiti that I would like. And I am simply unable to wear all the hats that need to be involved to pull this off. Perhaps you have been reading, seeing need and thinking, \u201cOh, I can do that!\u201d</p>\n<center>http://notanotheraveragejoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/100_6332.jpg&nbsp;</center>\n<h1>Two First Steps</h1>\n<p>My goal at this time is to try to plan two trips \u2013 one fact finding and strategy, the other initiation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since there is no land to purchase, implementation should not be particularly expensive. Perhaps the greatest expense will be red tape and bureaucracy. But there are expenses, and the amount of revenue available will directly affect how aggressively the project can be pursued. It\u2019s expected that these will include legal fees, transportation, acquisition of seeds and plants, tools and whatever other needs arise.</p>\n<p>To raise the funds, awareness must be raised first. To this end, perhaps a crowdfunding project would be in order.</p>\n<p>Initiating a crowdfunding campaign for this project at this time would be premature, in my opinion. More information needs to be gathered. A cost basis needs to be established. Agreements need to at least tentatively be reached. Legal and bureaucratic concerns need to be investigated.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>The Second Trip</h1>\n<p>I bring this up first, because it really can\u2019t be detailed well here. In order to assemble details, I need to be able to get to the island for another investigative trip first.</p>\n<p>The second trip would be to solidify the business arrangements, form the company/ies, dial in contracts, get firm commitments from landowners, etc. It would also include a more precise survey of the properties involved and some preliminary design to help the property owners to get started. If enough funds were available, it would be helpful to bring another regenerative/Regrarians\u00ae consultant along. It would also be helpful to have an export/import expert and someone savvy in international business involved by this time.</p>\n<center>http://notanotheraveragejoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/100_6300.jpg</center>\n<h1>First Trip</h1>\n<p>In order to get all these ducks in a row, I would like to take a trip in the near future. In fact, I\u2019ve been invited to a biodigester training course/workshop next month near Port au Prince that offers an opportunity to get more resources to La Gon\u00e2ve. This training will be offered by <a href=\"http://www.solarcities.eu/\">Solar Cities</a> as a guest of <a href=\"http://heartinhaiti.org/\">Haiti Education and Resource Team</a> (HEART). You can see one of their designs here. Someone mentioned that they may be using a new design at this workshop.</p>\n<center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEEpPpKQZ5U</center>\n<p>Jean Rony is already planning on being there for the training. Over the past week we\u2019ve discussed me joining him at the training and then traveling to La Gon\u00e2ve together.</p>\n<p>During my stay I will talk with lawyers, landowners and anyone else necessary in order to discern what would be involved in moving forward. Ideally, I\u2019d have a videographer with me who could record the trip and edit video and pictures into media for promoting the next phase.</p>\n<p>I suspect it would be best to meet lawyers on the mainland, but will defer to Jean Rony on that for now. Perhaps he knows a good one on La Gon\u00e2ve.</p>\n<p>We invite landowners from all along the peaks and ridges of the island to meet with us at Happy Dog. Any landowner would be invited to become part of the discussion, but the initial project would really need to be contiguous in order to promote the greatest degree of success in regenerating the land.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve shared earlier in the series why the focus is along the peaks and ridges. If you haven\u2019t followed along, suffice it to say that beginning at the top is the most productive means of regeneration and healing of any watershed. Links to previous articles can be found below my signature.</p>\n<h1>Raising Funds</h1>\n<p>In some ways, this is the most challenging part of the entire series. In fact, when I started it I actually hadn't intended on trying to take this trip yet. But opportunities have presented themselves, so it seems prudent to give it a shot. And the first steps have to take place in order to start getting into the regeneration.</p>\n<p>For me to make this first trip, I am seeking some donations and collaborative partners in this effort. Please let me know if you\u2019re interested.</p>\n<center>http://notanotheraveragejoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/100_6417.jpg<br>\nThis may have been the nicest house I saw on La Gon\u00e2ve. There was an area in Anse a Galets that I could see from the distance that might have included some nice homes as well. I was told there's a wealthy man's (American I think) home in the hills too, but never saw it.</center>\n<p>Note to those interested in being involved: ASHOG is involved in this and is a Christian organization. While the effort is not overtly Christian, many of those involved will be and the \u201catmosphere\u201d will be heavily influenced by Christians. Anyone involved would need to be comfortable with that.</p>\n<p>If I had the dough to just do this, I would. But, while I have a vision, knowledge, relationships and can make the time, I cannot manage expenses at home and for the trip as well.</p>\n<p>For this trip, I need about $2,500. In pursuit of that, all SBD raised from this post will go toward getting me to Haiti. If it falls short and I have enough to make up the difference, I'll use the Steem currently in my wallet. It represents all the SBD I\u2019ve earned since article one of this series.</p>\n<p>In order to reach this goal, this post would need to bring in at least $4,000, total. At current exchange rates and because of the depreciated SBD, that actually wouldn\u2019t reach the total, but I think I could manage it anyway.</p>\n<p>Expenses include, $800+ for flights, $800 for accommodations (last time I got a killer deal, but can't count on it), $300 for transportation and the rest for food and incidentals. At the end of the trip I will leave whatever is left, minus about $20 for food on the return flight, for needs on La Gon\u00e2ve. I tend to be very frugal, so would anticipate that some will remain.</p>\n<p>I realize it\u2019s a longshot, but figured I\u2019d lay it out there. Perhaps those interested in helping would spread the word, post links to this series or otherwise promote it to try to help generate interest.</p>\n<center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5cWxEl5uXI<br>\n<em>This video reflects the condition of the island and how it is often forgotten.</em></center>\n<p>If a videographer would like to make the trip with me, please let me know. Unless this post rockets astronomically, I won\u2019t be in a position to cover your costs. But you could be included as a long-term team member, if that interests you.</p>\n<p>If I do not reach this goal, I will either set the SBD aside for when I can raise enough funds or send them to the children\u2019s school, depending on feedback I receive at that time. This will include any Steem or SBD transferred to my account as a donation, unless otherwise designated.</p>\n<p>If you would like to make a donation specifically to the school or children\u2019s home, you can designate it as such in the notes, or go to the <a href=\"https://www.crowdrise.com/ashogeducationforgon/fundraiser/joejohnson6\">Children\u2019s School donation pages on Crowdrise</a>. If you desire to get involved in any capacity, feel free to reach out to @joe in steemit.chat.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m happy to submit my accounting to an independent auditor, if so desired. Mainly, I just want to help the people of La Gon\u00e2ve to regenerate their land and lives and appreciate any help getting over this hump.</p>\n<center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i14dZNGnlPs</center>\n<p>Thanks again! Your encouragement has meant a great deal to me, Jean Rony and the people of La Gon\u00e2ve who have been able to follow along as well.</p>\n<p>Steemin' on,<br>\nAnother Joe<br>\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://notanotheraveragejoe.com/wp-content/themes/busybee/images/logo-trans.png<br>\n<a href=\"\u201dhttp://notanotheraveragejoe.com/subscribe/\u201d\">Email notifications</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NotAnotherAverageJoe/\">Facebook</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Another_Joe\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p>If you would like to read through this entire series on regenerating the island of La Gon\u00e2ve, they\u2019re linked here in order.

    "body": "Why are we hating so much right now? I see certain forces are striking a line straight down the middle of our society. Several, actually. We are at war with other countries and we are at war with each other. Our neighbours, our differences, it\u2019s sad to see.\n\nhttps://cdn.pbrd.co/images/VNV7ZKDW.jpg\n\nI\u2019ve always been a person to celebrate the differences of each other. I mean if the world and everyone in it was the same life would be a completely boring place to live and work. Yet people seem to be getting caught up in the irrelevant, the non-important, things that don\u2019t even matter.\n\nIt all starts when a Politician has an idea. He tells us that we\u2019ll be better off with his new theory that he\u2019s just about to implement. That we\u2019ll get the very best of [x] service and we\u2019ll benefit for years to come. We all cheer and celebrate for this new service like it\u2019ll be the best thing since sliced bread. Great idea we say, I can\u2019t wait to see it implemented.\n\nThen when it fails to serve us and works as a funnel to the top of the class pyramid. Workers on $10 an hour, and the fat shit at the top is on a yearly wage of 4 Million + bonuses people get annoyed. They get annoyed that their wages are stagnating. They get angry that whilst their income hasn\u2019t improved in 5 years, food prices are doubled.\n\nAnd the Politicians get up on the podium and they say, hey, hey, hey. It wasn\u2019t us. It\u2019s was them over there. The illegals, the black men, the Mexicans. They\u2019re stealing your money. They\u2019re a drain on society. We fund everything and they come over here and suck everything out.\n\nhttps://cdn.pbrd.co/images/VPjbNX9X.jpg\n\nTHAT\u2019s why your wages haven\u2019t increased and food prices have doubled. Fat shit illegals and their me, me, me attitude.\n\nAnd like an oblivious heard of sheep we believe them. We don\u2019t fact check or research we just believe the crap that\u2019s spouted at us. Every single bit. And that\u2019s how Donald Trump gains momentum. Does anyone who likes this man actually fact check stuff? I\u2019d love to hear what you say. Please prove me wrong.\n\nSo we\u2019re being misdirected whilst those that wanted it are sucking all the money straight to the top. And we aren\u2019t doing a god damned thing about it. We aren\u2019t standing up and saying,\n\n\u201cHey, fuck this. You promised me more. I want more\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re just sitting there and letting it happen. We\u2019re accepting the choices we are being given rather than doing a bit of dictating like we should realise we have the power to do. And that\u2019s why they keep us arguing amongst ourselves. Race, privilege, place of birth, nationality, ethnicity, gender, it\u2019s all irrelevant at the end of the day. Labels to separate and misdirect us. We don\u2019t realise how strong we\u2019d be if we were all in it together.\n\nhttps://cdn.pbrd.co/images/VQF398UC.jpg\n\nI see in America with the choice between Clinton and Trump isn\u2019t a very good one. That to me seems like a choice between the devil and hades. Not a good one in my opinion, but hey. We aren\u2019t doing anything about it anyway.\n\nSo why care?",

At some point they became about money.  You can't have partial trust over so serious a medical intervention as injecting mixtures of pathogens, adjuvants, preservatives, stabilisers, material from other species and contaminants, multiple times, into babies and children who have **no choice**.  There is ample evidence available to bring trust in vaccines into question and without trust, the whole vaccine system is completely defunct.  \n\n**Every reasonable person would be behind a product which was PROVEN to be absolutely safe and prevented serious disease from occurring**\n\nUnfortunately, because of the corrosive influences of money and power, the very idea of 'vaccine' is contaminated.  With mounting evidence against the safety of vaccines, an abundance of information about the relative risks of disease, what parent would inject their baby?  Only someone that still blindly trusted big pharma, the politicians and the doctors who've swallowed their propaganda or get paid.  But how is this level of trust still possible when not a day goes by that new revelations of the abuse of trust, perpetrated by governments and companies, is not revealed?\n\nThe idea that vaccines are safe is ludicrous by most people's definition of the word.  \"Safe\" in this context is an example of Orwellian double speak.  \"Safe\" actually means....we know they're definitely risky for some, in fact they're catastrophically bad (which is why we pay out millions of dollars in compensation for those that are damaged or killed)  and there are the unquantifiable risks of contamination or interactions we haven't studied, the risks of the schedule as a whole, which again, we haven't studied, increased risk when the patient is already sick....which we don't routinely test for and a pile of other stuff which makes vaccines \"safe.\" \n\nHow many of us like to play russian-roulette?\n\nhttps://steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/imagea239c.jpg\n\n*\"Sixty percent of the time, it works every time.\" Brian Fantana*\n\nThe idea that vaccines work as they should is ludicrous given the list of ingredients, the mixtures, the number of times you need the same vaccine, the number of side-effects, the number of adverse reactions, the severity of the reactions.  This stuff has not been optimized for safety, for the public good.  Choices of expediency and the manipulation of the scientific process have created the concoctions now called vaccines.\n\n**What about hidden damage?**  Where is the proof that having a vaccine does not undermine a child's developing immune system by say 20%, leading them to be more susceptible to disease or allergies later in life?  What about damage that is misdiagnosed or ignored? \n\nWhere are the studies on complex interactions between mixtures of vaccines and the vaccine schedule?  Given the above statement, simply attributing the apparent survival of children that complete the schedule is not scientific evidence or proof they cause no harm.\n\nDr Anthony Samsel has recently announced a [study](http://www.thedailysheeple.com/vaccine-bombshell-most-vaccines-confirmed-to-be-tainted-with-glyphosate-monsantos-roundup_092016) that has discovered GLYPHOSATE, an ingredient of the roundup herbicide, has contaminated a significant proportion of the **global vaccine supply.**  A powerful chemical toxin, in the majority of vaccines, being routinely injected into babies.  **WHAT THE FUCK!**   Any science around the effects of that?  How long has that total travesty been going on?  Right there, that single **fact** on it's own, is a reason for all vaccines to be shunned until the entire body of science around vaccines can be transparently redone, the perpetrators of this monstrous fraud held to account, reparations made to those who have been damaged and a critical look at the philosophy of social and private influences in medicine.\n\n**What would you expect to happen if BABY FOOD contained fragments of glass and traces of arsnic?**\n\nJust imagine for one second, the number of babies and families that have potentially been harmed and altered by these shoddy vaccines and the number that could have been helped had the technology focused on integrity and safety?  We might not have wasted billions and we might have genuinely safe vaccines by now instead of a total breakdown of trust between the medical establishment and people all over the world.\n\nThis is the perfect example of what happens when you allow money and power to mix with medicine and the health of people.\n\nIt is an outrage.  It is obscene.\n\nAny mandated vaccination schemes, at this point, are an act of chemical warfare against innocent people.  When undermining people\u2019s health is profitable, this is what you get.  When every victim potentially generates a lifetime of profit, this is what you get.",

    "body": "<center>![](http://svmassagetherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slumpshoulder.jpg)</center>\nHappy Friday Steemit, this is a continuation of my story in which I talk about what I did to correct my posture.  The last post I did covered Deadlifts and the benefits I gained from it, if you missed that one you can read it [here](https://steemit.com/life/@ayim/fixing-posture-part-1-deadlifts).  In this post I will write about static holds to improve the lower portion of the body. \n***\n<center> <h2> Isometric holds </h2> </center>\n<center>![](https://www.t-nation.com/img/photos/2012/12-716-04/jason-statham.jpg)</center>\n\nIsometric holds are great for stability and for building strength. These exercises are super friendly for people who just started working out and it can modified to be challenging for advanced athletes. I believe everyone should be doing some sort of isometric holds incorporated with their exercise routine. Its low impact, highly challenging, and it can be done anywhere.\n\n### Isometric Training\n\nIt can be applied anywhere, with weights or not, the main idea of isometric training is to slow it down. I see a lot of personal trainers not really showing their clients these exercises which I think its odd because their clients are normally beginners and not fully aware of their own motor skills. Doing isometric exercises will help people understand the muscles being used in each movement. Lets test it out, try doing a slow squat for 5-10 seconds each way, lower yourself until your hips are slightly below your knee and come back to standing position. You should probably feel which part of your leg is activated throughout the motion.\n\n### Routine \n* Squats (3-5 reps of 5-10 seconds )\n* Lunges (3- 5 reps of 5-10 seconds)\n* V-sits (3-5 reps of 10-60 seconds)\n* Planks (3-5 reps of 10-60 seconds)\n* Bridge (3-5 reps of 10-60 seconds)\n<sup><strong>Rest only enough where you think you can complete the next rep in proper form.</strong> </sup>\n<strong>*Remember to breathe*</strong>\n\n---\nThis routine is to help stabilize the pelvis, where people normally have issues due to sitting too long in the chair.  Take proper rest, this routine might not make you sore or tired, but your CNS (central nervous system) fatigue is easily hidden. Treat it like weight training, take at least a day  or two off in between. \n<center><h3>V-sit</h3>\n![v-sit](http://burnit.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/V-sit-ups.jpg)</center>\n<center><h3>Plank Variations</h3>\n![plank](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/44/b1/7c/44b17ce0ae2425dfa3273b9d12981830.jpg)</center>\n\n<center><h3>Bridge Variations</h3>\n![v-sit](http://ignorelimits.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Bridge-Exercise-Progression.png)</center>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Yesterday I had a job interview in the city of <strong>Lincoln, UK</strong>. A veterinarian practice was looking for a Vet to introduce in a poultry specialist group. Those who are following my blog should know that I am not working since 1 month because I need to finish my post degree and I need to be focused on my study.</p>\n<p><strong>I have never worked as a vet in poultry farms;</strong> I did some <em>Salmonella </em>inspections but be a specialised poultry veterinarian is something that I have never considered.</p>\n<p>Anyway few days ago I received this call where a woman was asking me if I was available for an interview and I said yes of course.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two days ago I was reading a booklet I had from the previous job (just to refresh my knowledge before the interview).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_094909d4f68.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><strong>This is me and the booklet, ready for the interview :)</strong></p>\n<p>Lucky me, my girlfriend had a day off so we went together and my idea was... <em>\"let's do the interview.. and if I will not have luck, doesn't matter, I can see one of the nicest city in England\".</em></p>\n<p>I drove 120 miles and in 2.15 hours to be there!</p>\n<p>During the interview I wasn't stressed at all, I was laughing and making stupid jokes. One of the vets was coming from <strong>Cornwall</strong> and as you know I have been <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@webdeals/taking-steemit-to-the-end-of-the-land-land-s-end-cornwall-england-part-1\">there</a> 2 weeks ago, so I have something to talk about it :).</p>\n<p>The interview went very well ( I suppose ) and they told me that they will let me know by the end of the next week because they have other interviews and I said of course with a <strong>big smile</strong> on my face.</p>\n<p>At that point I didn't care about it... I had my chat/interview and now we were starving so, we drove directly to the city centre and we stopped in a restaurant called Zizzi, a chain restaurant where are serving Italian's food.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We had fritto misto ( mixed fried ) as starter, I had a massive pizza pepperoni and Kamila had pasta with I don't know what. We were starving so the only photo I have is about the starters LOL.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_142933c396c.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>We stand up after the meal like we were pregnant! </strong>So full that you cannot understand. We started looking around this city because in case I will get the job I should move there! Lincoln is a very nice city, medieval architecture, built on a hill with Cathedral and Castle on the top and all the buildings were going down till the marina that actually is an enlarged part of a river where you can find few boats.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_164620ea5e5.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_164615f653e.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1521455a385.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1523034e72d.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1530325adda.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1545139d2ca.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We went in the main street that was plenty of shops, we started watching the first, the second etc etc... till finally we arrived in front of a street where the slope was at least 45%. Was the only way to get to the castle so I we went there and once arrived my heart was tachycardic. In that moment there was a graduation day, all the students from Lincoln's University were coming out from the Cathedral that was closed to the visitors and were going into the Castle. Well we were well dressed because the interview so we followed these students and relatives so we went in the castle and <strong>we didn't pay</strong> any ticket LOL.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1600271b2ee.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_160052e1431.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_160542cf3b0.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>After that and after the long day we agreed to come back home completely tired looking forward to rest a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: once I was typing this post I have received a voice mail from the vet that would like to discuss about my &nbsp;interview but I tried to call him back and he is busy. Keep tuned and I will let you know ;).</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> THEY JUST CALLED ME TELLING THAT ARE GLAD TO OFFER ME THE POSITION AND THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ASAP IF I WILL BE PART OF THEIR TEAM</p>\n<h2>If you enjoyed my post feel free to follow me and to write me a comment. :)</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

My 2016 has been a series of intense and emotionally painful scenarios. Maybe I'll explain this further in a future article, but for right now, the gist of the story is that I fell into a massive depression between the months of March and August. It was Rock Bottom for me, and there were points during these months where I truly felt I was not going to make it out alive.  I began to close down emotionally, and completely isolated myself. Even my *best friend* did not hear from me for over five months. \n\nThe good news is that I don't feel like that anymore. As much as I truly wanted to lay down and give up, I somehow pushed through. I eventually realized that I was not living up to my full potential, and the situation I was in was <b>NEVER</b> going to let me live up to that potential. So I made drastic changes. I found some strength I unknowingly had, and <b>purged</b> the things in my life that didn't serve my greatest good. I basically chose to burn everything I knew down to the ground (metaphorically speaking) so I could build it up again; only better. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p206x206/14199692_10154425280802180_5749426944932582371_n.jpg?oh=9562a7c5a6d1c91aa15b215bb06b89ac&oe=583A9C22\"></center>\n\nCurrently everything is still in shambles, though, at least the fire is out. And once you realize you've burned everything down, you quickly become motivated to fix that. Rock bottom is a good place to be at times. I believe everyone will go through some sort of Rock Bottom at some point of their life as a test of strength and character. \n\n<center><h5>Just *how* strong are you? Are you going to wallow, or are you going to push through it? It's completely up to you. Personally, I chose to wallow for about two weeks, and then I got sick and tired of that, graciously picked myself up, and moved forward.</h5></center>\n\nWhy did I metaphorically burn everything to the ground? Why did I give up the life I was living? \n\nBecause the metaphoric foundation of this metaphoric house was built on metaphoric sand. It really offered nothing for me except the promise of working hard for someone else's dream (a great dream, but not my dream), and living in someone else's shadow for the rest of my life. And I was ok with that at first, because I didn't really see myself as worthy or deserving of anything more. \n\n<center><h3>And then I experienced Ayahuasca.</h3></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14141936_10154397735912180_6968112830431779711_n.jpg?oh=69513099f9a5b8c992037d17ba3b5a4b&oe=587FCB23\"></center> \n\nI am so grateful that I got to meet this mind-blowing medicine. I sat wrapped in a blanket overlooking the Ocean in Acapulco, Mexico fascinated with the fact that I had a body! I truly feel like I touched the core of my soul in a time span of seven hours. And once you touch the core of your soul, you recognize *just how beautiful and loving* (and <b>powerful</b> because of that) you truly are. I realized the light inside of me that burned so passionately was not supposed to be wasted.\n\nI understood this medicine more than I understood myself, and in that moment I realized just how important it was to share Ayahuasca with as many people as I could. I realized that I had a powerful voice, and if I talked loud enough, people would hear me. I <b>knew</b> in that ceremony that I was put on this earth to help assist in the healing of others' mental and emotional states. Am I the healer? No. The real healer is the sacred plant. I'd just help administer her. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p206x206/14233192_10154425322662180_7883334594280044695_n.jpg?oh=db3576234335e20913df775a5aadb296&oe=5845C4A4\"></center>\n\n<center><h3>*So the reason why I burned everything I knew, the reason why my life is literally unrecognizable, is to help in the process of healing our world; one individual at a time.*</h3></center> \n\nI truly believe that the Universe is evolving. We cannot push it faster than it is already moving. Obviously, the *Number 1* goal for anarchists is to end government. But I truly believe that will only happen when nearly everyone on earth has found inner peace. Without inner peace, there will be more tyranny, more war, more suffering. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p206x206/14291778_10154425312337180_5341636245782905790_n.jpg?oh=e6cc3c75705b19747f4e793aefc7f001&oe=587E3796\"></center>\n\nThat's why I believe psychedelics are keys to our mind's eternal library. All psychedelics can open various doors into your subconscious, but I feel Ayahuasca is the <b>*Master Key*</b>. She can open the deepest hidden doors to your psyche in a very gentle way. \n\n<center><h4>I want to see a world full of love, personal freedom, and potential. I burned everything down so I could devote my entire life to helping others find their true potential through the therapy of Ayahuasca. She shows you how beautiful it is to be human, and that this experience should not be wasted. If my life has to be in shambles for a temporary period so more people find their true potential and inner peace, *I'm totally okay with that*.</center></h4>\n<br>",

    "body": "### First, I just want to thank my parents for all of the incredible sacrifices they made for me.\n\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/XtRGWcj.jpg</center>\n\nI've always tried to do things my way, despite the fact I'm smart enough to know that learning from _other people's mistakes_ is the most preferred method of figuring out how to make your way through life.  If you make your own mistakes every single time, you're going to be dragging behind everyone else for your whole life.  This was a lesson my parents, especially my Dad, tried to impart on me time and again when I was growing up.  Of course, being the genius-level smartass I was, I thought I knew better.\n\nI treated my parents with disdain for a few years when I was a teenager, and I would give **anything** to take that back.  These are people that worked four jobs between the two of them and drove a beat-up '86 Honda Civic hatchback for five years just so I could go to kindergarten and have new clothes.  They broke themselves in half more than once to make sure I could go to a private school from third to sixth grade.  They were unceasingly patient with me even though they didn't need to be, especially once I graduated high school and really started screwing the pooch in college.  Throughout all of my nonsense, they never stopped loving me and supporting me, and they've given me every chance in the world.  I don't think I'll ever thank them enough for that.\n\n### Recently, my grandfather had a bad fall back home in Romania, and my grandmother had a stroke.\n<div class=\"pull-left\">http://i.imgur.com/PzfbIrYm.jpg\n<center><h4>My Grandfather</h4> </center>\n</div>  \nMy father has flown back and forth to Romania three times now in order to see to his mother and father, moving them into a decent assisted living home.  While my father isn't a very emotional person (compared to me, he is downright <b>stoic</b>), I know this is taking a toll on him.  Since we live on opposite ends of the United States from each other, I don't have much day-to-day interaction with him, and so I'm left in the dark with being able to gauge how he's doing.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">http://i.imgur.com/VAKqKLRm.jpg\n<center><h4>My Grandmother</h4></center></div>\n<br>\nBut more than that, it got me thinking about what life would be like once my own parents got to that point.  They're in their early 50's, so there's still years to go before that happens, but I suppose any time we're faced with the possibility of someone close to us face his or her end, it comes to mind.  I also accept that this is going to happen.  Despite what the transhumanists might like to say, death is a part of life.  Everyone that lives will eventually pass away, living on in the memories of those they leave behind.\n\n\n### What would I do without them in my life?\n\nDespite the enormous distance that separates us, I still talk to them constantly.  We tell each other about how our lives are going, we offer each other support, and we bring each other up if any of us is having a hard time.  I can't imagine what it would be like to no longer have that connection.  It feels like a big, empty hole inside of me whenever I try to picture it, and I immediately stop trying to.\n\nWhen my mother's father passed, I wasn't particularly upset by it.  I hadn't developed a very close connection with him, but with my parents?  They raised me.  I lived with them every day well into my twenties.  Aside from the thoughts of figuring out their estate and taking care of any affairs I'd need to handle when they pass, there's still the utter _lack_ of them in my life afterward.  I honestly don't know what I'd do without them.\n\nI guess I'll figure it out when that time comes.  Hopefully it won't come soon, and I hope they get to enjoy being grandparents to my daughter for many years to come.  With any luck, they can enjoy being greatgrandparents as well, and we can all sit back and chuckle about how strange kids are these days, and how things were so much different for us.  **Really and truly, I just hope I get enough chances to tell them I love them, and how much they have meant and still mean to me every day**.\n\n<center> <img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn59/Glorybound87/20160807_224529_zps75uqrq4v.jpg\"></center>\n_Andrei Chira is a vaper, voluntaryist, and all-around cool dude.

This is something that I stumbled upon while perusing the many tunnels of Pinterest, and I really liked it so I'm passing it along to you guys!\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/6m31z0l\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6m31z0lh.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\n**Aloe and Green Tea Face Scrub:**\n- 1/3 cup Coconut Oil ( I melted my coconut oil to measure it, but the consistency was too liquidy with the other ingredients, so I cooled it and it turned out much better)\n- 1/4 cup Sugar\n- 1 Tbs. Aloe Vera Gelly\n- 2 Green Tea Bags\n- 3-4 drops Vitamin E Oil \n- 5-6 drops Tea Tree Oil\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/6oh3x8K\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6oh3x8Kh.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nCoconut oil is naturally anti-bacterial and anti-fungal, and also a great moisturizer. Aloe Vera is an anti-inflammatory ingredient and also promotes new cell growth. Sugar is for the exfoliation. Green tea has anti-aging properties to reduce wrinkles and sun damage (I love this part because I am in the sun ALL THE TIME!). Vitamin E oils work to block free radicals in your body that cause aging. Tea Tree oil is used to fight acne (I do develop the occasional breakout every now and then, so having the extra fighting power is great!). \n\nYou don't have to scrub hard because the sugar will do the work for you!\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/Bu1wrem\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Bu1wremh.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/xlcBRWU\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xlcBRWUh.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nLeft my skin feeling extra smooth and smelling like cookies!\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/jVezSCh\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jVezSChh.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nTry it! Really easy and you can save the leftovers for later!\n\nUse this scrub once a week to exfoliate. If you want just a simple day to day cleanser without the sugar to exfoliate, use only coconut oil and honey!\n\nJill",

But, for @mrs.steemit, age is only a number. And as soon as she laid eyes on Steemit, she knew she was ready to commit.\n\nBut how does this talented young woman make time for her busy lifestyle? Is she single (other than the whole being married to Steemit thing)? And what is @mrs.steemit's favorite and least favorite things about her metaphorical husband (Steemit)?\n\nI vow that this is an interview well worth the read. In sickness and in health... (you know the rest)\n\n---\n\n# 20 questions with @mrs.steemit\n\nhttps://s9.postimg.org/cvayysktr/Screen_Shot_2016_09_09_at_7_27_44_AM.png\n\n### 1 - How would you describe yourself in one sentence?\n\n@mrs.steemit - I don't think that a sentence-long description would be an accurate representation of me, but if you're interested in a pretty neat description of me, check my celtic tree astrology sign (07-28), which I by now should have written a post about on Steemit.\n\n### 2 - The username @mrs.steemit is a big statement. What do you think makes you the official \"mrs.steemit?\"\n\n@mrs.steemit - I didn't think about it as giving myself a big title, but rather showing my commitment to Steemit in a way like saying I\u2019m \u201cmarried to Steemit.\" That's why it's not Miss, but Mrs. \n\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/3sdcc02jl/Screen_Shot_2016_09_09_at_7_27_33_AM.png\n\n### 3 - For a 19-year-old, you sure have a lot on your plate! How do you manage to be COO of a digital agency, a social media guru, a motivational speaker and still have time for dancing and staying fit?\n\n@mrs.steemit - The secret I believe sounds simple, but is very true... For me it comes down to two things: \n\n1) The trigger, which is DETERMINATION! When you stop wishing and start wanting, you develop a drive that makes the impossible possible. The second part I needed to teach myself because my goals are spread across different categories and areas in life, so for that I needed... \n\n2) TIME MANAGEMENT. The real secret here lies in priority setting, making sacrifices and knowing how and why you spend your time the way you do in a daily basis. If I don't understand my daily routine it means I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going, so know what you want and then develop habits that make you achieve progress. I\u2019m far from perfect and get frustrated at times, but when I do I remind myself that this is the journey I chose. I made the choice to create a life I love to live and that's what keeps me going and motivates me to get my time management on point. Also I'm trying to really do as much as possible right now and in the next few years, because I'm 19, at a young age with no serious responsibilities yet. I sometimes wish I would have started even earlier, so you have more time to learn from mistakes and set a solid foundation to build on. Today and where technology is at right now, age is not an excuse. If your goal is to become a self-made millionaire by the age of 15, it is possible. Some kids already proved that by creating killer apps, learned to code for fun and  turned their hobby into huge businesses. I write a lot about that topic on my blog.\n\n### 4 - Your first post earned more than $2,000 - were you surprised by this?\n\n@mrs.steemit - Yes that was totally unexpected. I didn't believe it at first, definitely had to double check a couple of times. I remember I was by myself at home, refreshed the page and when I saw that I literally was talking to myself and kept saying, \"No f** way,\" then immediately sent a screenshot to my friend who told me about Steemit.\n\nhttps://s21.postimg.org/63s2ydgxz/Screen_Shot_2016_09_09_at_7_27_25_AM.png\n\n### 5 - Some of your more recent posts have earned considerably less, even though they are filled with great content. Has this been frustrating? Or are you thankful for anything you receive on Steemit?\n\n@mrs.steemit - Interesting question and I'm going to stay brutally honest with my answer. I'm always thankful when I get upvotes and happy when I see people commenting that they enjoy and appreciate my content. The community is really what keeps me going, but it's true that when you try your best to give to the community, and create value, you hope for a \"fair reward\" and that your posts earn on a consistent basis without having to hope that you\u2019re posting at a certain right time so that it gets noticed. But I don't compare my content to others and really focus on the value I want to give and people I can inspire, because if you're here for the long run, that's the only way to go I believe. I do think most of us spend quite some time on every post and because time is the most valuable asset we have, I would love to see that the return-on-investment will come to a balance, like we already see with some top content creators. \n\n### 6 - What is your favorite thing about Steemit?\n\n@mrs.steemit - Definitely the realness about it and power of the people. It feels like such a relief to finally have a platform that isn\u2019t based on superficial stuff and really the kind of people it attracts by that. We just held our first Steemit Meetup last weekend where I met some awesome Steemers in real life and the energy was incredibly amazing. There were like-minded people that connected and exchanged ideas and thoughts; that's what I love it and why I'm so passionate about the community. I got to meet some amazing minds and I don\u2019t know exactly where all of this is going and the impact it will make in the future, but I know that it\u2019s positive and has the biggest potential I\u2019ve ever witnessed to revolutionize the world.\n\nhttps://s9.postimg.org/7hfwps6tb/Screen_Shot_2016_09_09_at_7_28_00_AM.png\n\n### 7 - What is your least favorite thing about Steemit?\n\n@mrs.steemit - I know, I know: Steemit is still in Beta version, but to answer your question, for me it's the formatting and design when it comes to constructing a post. I know social media has spoiled my eyes, but I just love beautiful designs, color, perfectly sized pictures and format, which Steemit doesn't offer at this point in time. But I might also miss it when it's gone, because well the \"raw stage\" is something special most people don't experience and hop on the bandwagon along with millions when it's all perfect (they will never know the struggle of inserting a picture, copying and pasting links with your phone).\n\n### 8 - What is your favorite song? (Both right now, and all-time)\n\n@mrs.steemit - That\u2019s a tough one... I have too many for different moods (just wrote a post about being indecisive)\u2026 I\u2019ll give you my 4 most recently played on Spotify: Ain\u2019t No Time - Future, Feel No Ways - Drake, Let Me Love You - Ariana Grande, Progress - Mavado.\n\nAll-time fave: Ready or Not - Fugees and Say My Name - Destiny\u2019s Child \n\nhttps://s18.postimg.org/wd6mmlsnd/Screen_Shot_2016_09_09_at_7_27_48_AM.png\n\n### 9 - Describe your perfect weekend.\n\n@mrs.steemit - My perfect weekend preferably follows after a huge business breakthrough and includes: waking up with a beautiful view, amazing group of inspiring minds, friends, sunshine, ocean, dance, music, food and drinks, adventures driving around discovering places during the day, private party at night, fun and laughter, deep talks, action and relaxation.\n\n### 10 - What is your favorite style of dance?\n\n@mrs.steemit - Being a Hip-Hop New Style dancer, that style appeals to me the most and I love to watch dancers from the L.A Millennium Dance Complex. But I\u2019m seriously impressed by every dance and dancer, every true artist who is able to express emotion and convey music by the movement of their body. Complete control of your body movement, no matter what style is extremely impressive to me.\n\n### 11 - Whose Steemit blog(s) do you enjoy following the most?\n\n@mrs.steemit - Right off the bat, I would say my good friend @sirwinchester then @andrarchy @anwenbaumeister @knozaki2015 @chrisroy\n\n### 12 - Describe the worst date you've ever been on.\n\n@mrs.steemit - Oh lord, to be honest the worst date wasn\u2019t an actual date, but a long story and rather a confession\u2026 \n\nI had been texting back and forth with a guy and knew he was a friend of my friend. Shortly before our first date I found out that he had a girlfriend for 3 years they were living together and I ended up calling her to find out if it was true. She was shocked and didn\u2019t believe me at first, but then I told her I have a date with him tomorrow and we planned to set him up\u2026 \n\nLong story short, I had to go on a date with him for about 30 minutes until she joined us confronting him, yelling in public what the F** he\u2019s doing. To all of our surprise, he kept up the lie denying her, but then just walked away embarrassed. She asked me if I could come with her to their apartment to move out her things\u2026 \n\nCrazy story, he sent me an apology text afterwards that it was not right to lie about having a girlfriend. Sadly about 3 months later I saw them at an event back together... I will never understand those girls...\n\nhttps://s11.postimg.org/g6kqn2b5v/Screen_Shot_2016_09_09_at_7_27_57_AM.png\n\n### 13 - Who inspires you?\n\n@mrs.steemit - I have different people who inspire me, men and women in different areas of life. To make it short and different here are 7 women who inspire me: Christina Saliba, Arianna Huffington, Ellen Degeneres, Sophia Amoruso, Beyonce, Oprah, Audrey Hepburn.\n\n### 14 - You get to have dinner with three people, living or dead. Who are you eating with?\n\n@mrs.steemit - Drake, Oprah, Albert Einstein\n\n### 15 - Tell us about your most embarrassing moment.\n\n@mrs.steemit - Lol, too many! \n\nOne of them to keep it short: I had to announce the next band on stage at a school event in front of the entire class, parents and teachers. In the middle of the announcement, I paused trying to remember their name, improvising, \"Please welcome.... Some great musicians\" (in German). I don't know what I was thinking, everyone was so confused, There was awkward silence and some claps and laughter from my friends.\n\n### 16 - Where is one place you've not let traveled that's at the top of your list to visit?\n\n@mrs.steemit - California\n\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/pcpm22t7l/Screen_Shot_2016_09_09_at_7_27_38_AM.png\n\n### 17 - Are you single?\n\n@mrs.steemit - Yes (besides being married to Steemit)\n\n### 18 - What is your favorite food?\n\n@mrs.steemit - I love Italian, yummy pasta with shrimp... favorite fruit is mango and favorite dessert is oreo ice cream.\n\n### 19 - What are you most likely to order at a bar?\n\n@mrs.steemit - Can never go wrong with a caipirinha or gin and tonic.\n\n### 20 - What is one thing very few people know about you?\n\n@mrs.steemit - I get paranoid at night in the dark outside. I always think something's about to happen, but then I try to think the opposite way so that it doesn't actually happen, if that's somehow logical.\n\n---\n\nThanks so much to @mrs.steemit for taking the time to respond with fantastic answers, and for providing great photos as well.\n\nAlso, a huge thank-you to all of you for taking the time to read.\n\n**Who would you like to see me throw 20 questions at? Drop me a comment below and I'll work on setting up the interview.**\n\n### If you like what you read, be sure to follow my [blog](https://steemit.com/@wadepaterson)!\n\nhttps://s18.postimg.org/7ftaa4b09/Screen_Shot_2016_09_09_at_7_24_02_AM.png\n\n# Previous \"20 questions\" interviews:\n\n[20 questions](https://steemit.com/travel/@wadepaterson/20-questions-with-heiditravels-exclusive) with @heiditravels\n[20 questions](https://steemit.com/travel/@wadepaterson/20-questions-with-katecloud-exclusive-interview) with @katecloud\n[20 questions](https://steemit.com/photography/@wadepaterson/20-questions-with-manthostsakirid-exclusive-interview-with-that-guy-who-did-the-kick-ass-steemit-photoshoot) with @manthostsakirid\n[20 questions](https://steemit.com/blockchain/@wadepaterson/20-questions-with-blockchaingirl-exclusive) with @blockchaingirl\n[20 questions](https://steemit.com/steemit/@wadepaterson/20-questions-with-piedpiper-exclusive) with @piedpiper\n[20 questions](https://steemit.com/secret-writer/@wadepaterson/20-questions-with-stellabelle-aka-the-secret-writer) with @stellabelle\n[20 questions](https://steemit.com/travel/@wadepaterson/20-questions-with-budgetbucketlist) with @budgetbucketlist\n[20 questions](https://steemit.com/life/@wadepaterson/20-questions-with-roger-ver-exclusive-interview) with @rogerkver\n[20 questions](https://steemit.com/food/@wadepaterson/20-questions-with-allasyummyfood) with @allasyummyfood\n[20 questions](https://steemit.com/life/@wadepaterson/20-questions-with-the-alien) with @the-alien\n[20 questions](https://steemit.com/life/@wadepaterson/20-questions-with-janina-storace-2015-16-member-of-the-la-kings-ice-crew) with [Janina Storace](https://twitter.com/thisgirljanina)",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>https://i.imgsafe.org/2fcd074bd9.jpg</p>\n<p>What I want to say is that results surprise me, I have mixed feelings from the first days. Joy, shock, surprise and disappointment, everything got mixed up. The most surprising thing for me was that my articles in Russian get more than the ones in English. I haven't realized yet myself who votes for them and why. So, let's find it out together.</p>\n<p>My English is not good, I write an article in Russian, and after that I send it to a translator. After I have posted my first article, in one of the chats I've been asked to give more details, how much I paid the translators, editors, what other costs I had. People also asked me about other difficulties I faced during the experiment. I will tell you about it in this post.</p>\n<p>Let me start explaining things one after another. I have articles in both languages, so, of course, I decided to post both variants. I saw other people posting bilingual articles, but I find this option more suitable for articles with little text and many pages. As for my articles, they have a lot of text and I think it's more comfortable to read them when they are written separately in each language. It's very interesting to know what you think about it. Let discuss it in the comments.</p>\n<p>I never wrote in such a high pace - one article per day. And, honestly, I don't know, if I cope with it. To put myself in conditions, where I have to work in a high pace, was one of the reasons to start this experiment. Yesterday I almost failed my schedule. I finished the article only by the evening, and it also needed to be translated. But I was lucky, @xanoxt came to rescue me. Due to our time difference, he finished translating at 5 am only, and I am very thankful for that.</p>\n<h2>3 days - 3 articles, the results are the following:</h2>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Article</td>\n    <td>Payout</td>\n    <td>SD</td>\n    <td>SP</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Is it possible to make money on Steemit? 30 Days Steemit Experiment [EN]</td>\n    <td>$57.92</td>\n    <td>26.699</td>\n    <td>33.097</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Is it possible to make money on Steemit? 30 Days Steemit Experiment [RU]</td>\n    <td>$41.23</td>\n    <td>18.162</td>\n    <td>22.637</td>\n </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>I am an idiot!

It's cool and shitty at the same time. It's cool, because it gives visibility to my posts, and other people can notice me, also I can earn a bit and, at least, pay off my costs on a translator.</p>\n<p>Of course, I appreciate what these users did for me. I really want to know who these people are. Do they speak Russian? Do they read my articles or just use some kind of a smart algorithm, part of which I became, in voting?</p>\n<p>Dear whales, if you are real and you are reading my articles at the moment, I would like to get to know you. If it's possible, please let me now in the comments, who you are and why you support my posts. Or you can privately text me on steemit.chat.</p>\n<p>This uncertainty freaks me out. If the main income from my posts is made by my regular readers who really care what I write about, it gives me confidence and stability. If it's all about the algorithms, well\u2026 the algorithms may change at any moment.</p>\n<h2>Comments</h2>\n<p>My posts in Russian are also commented more often. It seems to me that even my posts in English have more comments from the Russian guys))) I think it's because I am quite active in Russian chats and I mostly leave comments on the Russian-speaking segment of Steemit. I am much obliged to everyone for the support and feedback.</p>\n<h2>Expenses</h2>\n<p>Once again I'd like to quote the questions from @primus, \"How much did you pay the translators and editors? What other costs did you have?\" People also asked me about other difficulties I faced during the experiment.</p>\n<p>I have the two types of expenses - time and payments to translators. I am not a professional writer, I write the articles on my own and don't have any editors. I have two friends, they also write on Steemit, we exchange the articles with each other before translating and posting. It helps to get the first feedback and correct some details. I have already told you that I spend a lot of time on an article, so don't get surprised by the numbers.</p>\n<p><table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Article</td>\n    <td>Time<br>to write</td>\n    <td>Translation<br>costs</td>\n </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Is it possible to make money on Steemit? 30 Days Steemit Experiment</td>\n    <td>2 days</td>\n    <td>$13,50</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>I am an idiot! Cashing on Steemit. Is it the most Important? </td>\n    <td>5 hours</td>\n    <td>$11,70</td>\n </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>How to Foster a Vegetable, an Instruction </td>\n    <td>5 hours</td>\n    <td>payment on the fact</td>\n </tr>\n</table></p>\n<p>To promote my first two articles I spent 20 dollars on each one. It didn't bring any results in my case. I guess it's too early to calculate the profit right now, I will give you more details after 7 days of posting.</p>\n<p>As for difficulties, the first one I had was finding a translator who would do his job well and quickly. Good professionals are often busy for days ahead, so you need to have several people to work with. For all the time I have worked with 6 people, I order regularly from two of them.</p>\n<p>I suppose, the main difficulty, not only for me, but for the most of Steemit users, is to make your article noticeable.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>In general, I am happy about the results of the first 3 days. I get upvoted regularly by the small whales, but I do realize that everything may change, maybe after posting this article and such statistics.</p>\n</html>",

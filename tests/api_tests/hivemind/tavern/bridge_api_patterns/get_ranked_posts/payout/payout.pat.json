A number of posts by a co-founder and @steemitblog has spurred widespread discussions on **Curation efforts and Voting patterns**.  Also, the issue of **\u201cID theft, harassment and plagiarism\u201d** was widely discussed. \nSteemMag in its usual manner reached out to a number of key Steemians who have in-depth knowledge of the issues and had chats with them\u2026. Really interesting chats\u2026. I had a great time getting everything ready.. I\u2019m sure you will enjoy it too.\nGet a cup of coffee and let\u2019s kick off the fun ride :)\n\n---\n**In page 1:**\nSteemMag had a chat with @riverhead \u2013 A whale who is also a witness and also the back-end moderator of Steemit.chat. A very nice guy I must say. We had a chat with him on topics ranging from how he joined Steemit, community participation and curation.  I\u2019m sure you would enjoy hearing from him. \n I also had a chat with @firepower- who is the front-end Lead Moderator of Steemit.chat\n\n**In Page 2:**\nSteemMag had a chat with @anyx , The Lead of the Steemcleaners project\nWe also reached out to a number of steemians for our weekly Steemians Speak  on an exciting topic that can bring some nostalgia. ;)\nAnd lots more\n---\n**SteemMag in Russian**\nIn addition to the ongoing translation of previous issues of SteemMag to chinese, @zaebars had the idea of translating previous issues of SteemMag and Official Steemit announcements to the Russian language. I believe this ongoing translation projects will help provide more language diversity on Steemit.... If you're interested in translating SteemMag to your native language. Please hit me on steemit.chat  @infovore for further discussions.\n\nP.S [Here is the link to the Russian translation of steemMag](https://steemit.com/ru/@rusteemitblog/steemmag-ezhenedelnyi-stimit-daidzhest-8-perevod-stati-infovore)  and [this](https://steemit.com/ru/@rusteemitblog/steemmag-ezhenedelnyi-stimit-daidzhest-8-2-perevod-stati-infovore)\n\n---\n\n<h2>A Chat With @riverhead</h2>\nhttps://s14.postimg.org/t0eh0af69/An_Exclusive_Interview_with__smooth.png\n\nSteemMag:\n**How did you get to know about steemit? And how has the journey been so far?**\n\n@riverhead:\n\nA friend of mine, who was involved early on, called me to tell me about really cool new crypto project. This was back in early April and I really liked the idea. A decentralized Buzzreditbook \u2013 how cool is that? Finally a blockchain project that wasn't trying to reinvent the financial world!\n\nSo far I've been having a blast with Steem and also the Steemit UI. Like any other large project there are good days and bad but the good days far outnumber the bad! I'm constantly amazed at the great people involved with the project. A quick look at steemtools.com is all it takes to see the deep pool of talent in and around the project.\n\n\nSM:\n**You are also a back-end moderator of steemit.chat. What are those things you've noticed so far?**\n\n@riverhead:\n\nThe biggest takeaway for me as moderator is just how little it takes for one person to get a channel completely fired up and turned into a troll-box. Thankfully we have a great team of levelheaded moderators that are helping to keep the peace!\n\nI have also been blown away by the people, such as Firepower, that have recognized the value of steemit.chat and have stepped up to do what they can to see it grow. Firepower has some great ideas and brings a lot of energy and optimism to the steemit.chat platform. Exciting times ahead!\n\n\n<br>\n\nSM:\n**A number of Steemians complain of the platform not running as smooth as that of slack. What more functionality should Steemians look out for?**\n\nI completely agree with those that have noticed the relative sluggishness of Rocket Chat versus Slack. We have been scaling up server side hardware and software to try to address these issues. Slack and Rocket Chat provide similar services but are intended for different audiences. A few key differences to note:\n\n\u2013\tOn Slack we had around 1000 users compared to a little over 3000 on Rocket Chat.\n\n\u2013\tThe free Slack service has a global message history limit of 10000. With the volume of traffic we have now on Rocket Chat a message would only last a few seconds and Direct Messages just wouldn't be functional at all. To remove that limitation Slack charges $7 USD/account. Yes, $21,000 USD/month for a chat server at our current occupancy!\n\n\u2013\tSlack is designed for teams with external management structures and therefore does not have the depth of moderator tools we enjoy with Rocket Chat. There are almost no moderator controls at all in Slack. For Slack's intended audience this is fine but for a public community of this size it would be chaos. The most obvious omissions are channel specific moderators and the ability to assign commands based on account role (moderators can mute users for example).\n\n\u2013\tRocket Chat allows the community to own its own data and log files. The paid version of Slack has some of this functionality but a community is still more or less at the mercy of Slack's EULA.\n\n\u2013\tA specific example of a difference between a community owned service and a paid service: when a few Slack accounts were compromised and email/passwords changed there was a lengthy back and forth with Slack support which didn't really get anywhere. On Rocket Chat we could return the compromised accounts to their respective owners in a few minutes.\n\n\n\nSM:\n**As a whale, what do you look for in posts before voting?**\n\n@riverhead:\n**I've answered this question and gone back and deleted it about five times now. So let's try it again, this time with feeling.** The two biggest goals for my voting are to grow the platform and reward quality content creators. One thing to keep in mind is that as a large Steem Power holder my incentives lean much more toward long term success of the platform than rewards from curating.\n\nWhen I'm reviewing a post I try to determine first and foremost if it is original, or properly cited, content. Community projects like Curie, Steemcleaners, #steemitabuse-classic, etc. are great in assisting with this highest level filter. Next I try to determine if a post will be of interest to others \u2013 is this a link I'd send to friends even if it was on another platform?\n\nAlso important to me is if an author is putting out great content and no one has noticed. Inline with platform growth I have a strong incentive to get eyes on that person's work!\n\n<br>\n\nSM:\n**There has been a recent rise in your curation efforts. How do you manage your daily activities and curation?**\n\n@riverhead:\nAren't open platforms great? There is no hiding on Steem! As mentioned above my primary goal is to grow value in the platform. Since I have no talent as writer, artist, or journalist this means curating content. A lot of content. Sadly there just aren't enough hours in the day to go through even half the content that's being generated! However I feel it needs to be done. To that end I have enlisted a good friend of mine, who also shares a lot of my values, to curate using my posting key. We are in constant communication and he's always trying to curate in a manner that fits the ethos I discussed above. He is his own person though so I suspect many will look with a raised eyebrow why one post got a vote and another did not. That's fine and all part of this great game!\n\n\nSM:\n**In which way do you think we can we a. Better distribute Steem power b. Improve the prices of Steem and SBD?**\n\n@riverhead:\n\nThis is an issue that will solve itself in time. A lot of the larger stakeholders seem to be idle from a curating perspective and also divesting their Steem Power and selling it. The net results in the short term is a lot of downward pressure on the price. Long term it means Steem will transition from a few early miners to users of the platform. \n\nThere are some that view whales powering down in a bad light. Naturally I am not in that camp but I can hardly claim an unbiased view. That said I do feel it is the best thing they can do to address the distribution issue. We cannot simultaneously want a flatter distribution of Steem and pressure people to not sell their stake. Personally I do not see the difference between one whale powering down a large stake or hundreds of people powering down a smaller stake. In my opinion the mechanic of the 104 week power down schedule levels the playing field from a dumping perspective.\n\nThe organic growth of Steemit, and by extension Steem, is exponential and effectively without bound. The downward pressure caused by my powering down is linear and has a very clear end point. The problem will solve itself so long as Steem is, and continues to be, a success.\n\nAs for the price of SBD I am quite happy with it priced around $1 USD/SBD. Like any stable coin it needs volume for the peg mechanisms to work. To generate volume a token needs some sort of utility. The interest rate on SBD is, again in my opinion, greatly overlooked by many. Also as the Steem platform grows in popularity so will the adoption of SBD by more services; much like the utility Bitcoin enjoys today as a payment token at many vendors.\n\n<br>\n\n\nSM:\n**There have been a number of proposed features on the blockchain? What's your view on the recent 5 votes a day proposal? And powering down whales losing their voting powers?**\n\n\n@riverhead:\n\nFirst let\u2019s just clear up one big misconception: **The goal is not five votes per day nor is that what is being implemented.** It is akin to implying a $5 daily spending budget will only allow someone to buy 5 things. That \nwould only be true if everything cost $1. Want to buy five hundred items? Great \u2013 buy items that are worth $0.01. \n\nWant to vote more than five times per day? Great \u2013 don't vote 100% weight with every mouse click. This change creates incentives for users to better understand voting weights but more importantly makes it much easier to compete with the voting bots. Humans versus bots is the real battleground not whales versus dolphins versus minnows. There have been many great posts on steemit.com that do a much better job of explaining this than I can so I urge people to seek out those posts and educate yourselves.\n\nRemoving voting power from those powering down seems like a knee jerk reaction to a problem that will solve itself in time. I would rather see more focus on increasing demand for the Steem token than creating more barriers to exit. The 104 week power down schedule is sufficient in my opinion.\n\n\nSM:\n**Your personal message to Steemians and projects they should look out for?**\n\n@riverhead:\nWe are still in the twilight dawn of the Steem era and need to take a long view of things to come. There is great danger in band-aid quick fixes to seemingly unfair but temporary issues. Keep producing and curating quality content, spreading the word of Steem, and developing really cool tools and projects that enrich the ecosystem. The world will continue to come to us.\n\nIf I can leave you all with one parting message it is simply to be kind and respectful to one another. Steem is attracting people from all walks of life, religions, opinions, personal experiences, politics, and ambitions. It is simply not possible for everyone to agree with everyone else nor is it possible to beat people into our one world view. Accept gracefully that we will have and need diversity if we want this platform to reach its potential.\n\n---\n\nThanks @riverhead for the really insightful replies.. It\u2019s refreshing to read another perspective on the important issues affecting Steemians.\n\n---\nhttps://s12.postimg.org/4ijigtqcd/An_Exclusive_Interview.png\n\n<h2>A Chat with @firepower</h2>\n\nSteemMag:\n**What are some surprising activities you've noticed so far in the chat channels and what changes would you like to see?**\n\n@firepower:\nInitiatives that I'm part of such as RobinHoodWhale, SteemCleaners have all emerged from the discussions (public and private) on the platform. It was a surprise to see engagement at this level and the motivation amongst users of the platform to collaborate with a single mindset to bring positive changes we wanted to see on the site. I'd like to more users helping each other with the queries as the user participation grows here and lesser trolls and scammers.\n\nI'm currently putting together **\"Steemit Social\" \u2014 a community management team that in its initial stages will handle moderation of certain to-be-designated official channels for steemit related discussions here.** \n\nThat will help consolidate some of our efforts in increasing engagement and retention of good users on Steemit. Hopefully it will lead to more innovative initiatives on Steemit.com as people see the benefits of collaboration and JV on this Steemit.Chat platform and use it to further networking and great content creation. \nAlthough a fair bit of this has been achieved with a number of initiatives that we've seen on the site already but team building for Steemit Social is currently underway.\n\nSteemMag:\n**How are moderators for channels chosen?**\n\n@firepower:\nThere are several channels on Steemit Chat many of which are user created for personal reasons. I personally over see over 50 channels on a regular basis. \n\nFrom this vast number a dozen or so channels have been selected for moderation under Steemit Social initiative. The moderators for these channels are selected on the basis of their current participation on the channels. Those proven to be proactive, helpful, collaborative are considered (if they are willing to step up to the task of moderation) \n\nAlso in addition to this I will be selecting on basis of the time they can devote to moderation and a few other criteria. But they can and will be a mix of old timers and new users.\n\n---\n\nThanks @firepower for having a chat with SteemMag. We wish you all the best :)\n\n---\n\n**Check out page 2 for more awesome features you wouldn't want to miss :)**\n -->[Page 2](https://steemit.com/steemmag/@infovore/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-steemcleaner-steemians-speak-fondest-moment-on-steemit-this-week-on-steemit-steemmag-steemit-s-weekend)",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Hello Steemians!</p>\n<p>This is the 2nd part of my story and trip to the north. My first stop was Iceland (<a href=\"https://steemit.com/travel/@lobotony/a-trip-to-the-north-part-1-of-2-iceland\">Part 1</a>). Further north I arrived in Greenland in the city <em>Tassilaq</em>, July 2009.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/greeland.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"610\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Some facts: <strong>Greenland is the biggest island in the world!</strong></p>\n<p>It is a politically autonomous part of Denmark and has the lowest population density in the world apart from the antarctic.</p>\n<p><em>Tassilaq</em> is the greenlandic name for the city, Ammassalik the danish and it is located in the south-east of Greenland. <em>Tassilaq</em> means 'like a calm lake' &nbsp;because it is located in a pretty quiet fjord.</p>\n<p><em>Tassilaq</em> was like my headquarter or base. I made a couple of excursions as well as you can imagine :)</p>\n<p>Some impressions of <em>Tassilaq</em> and some images of my excursions. Hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The idyll is simply fabulous!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/Tassilaq_main.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The even had a soccer field and I enjoyed watching them pretty much every day :) You can see it in the lower pat of the image.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/Tassilaq_2.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Tassilaq</em> at twilight.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/tassilaq_twilight.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>These little friends had not much to do. Huskys are adorable and beautiful animals, I love them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/husky.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But if you are in Greenland you have to do it: A dog-sled ride. It was awesome :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/husky_ride.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A different view on <em>Tassilaq</em>, from the distance. I was standing in a real flower carpet :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/flowers.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The harbor and a supply ship.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/Tassilaq_harbour.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The typical jerky, can be found next to the houses very often.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/jerky.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And of course I went on a trip to see icebergs. A must :) We went in those little boats, you can see them in the lower part of the image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/boats.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>On our way to the icebergs...</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/ice_landscape.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The colors, the landscape, the weather: A beautiful and breath taking mix.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/ice_landscape.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In the upper part, right side, you can see again the ice sheet, this part is always covered with ice!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/landscape.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We are used to cars driving by our house. They have floes instead :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/landscape_2.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>... and finally some icbergs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/icberg.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/icberg_huge.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/ice.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This is probably my favourite image :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/ice_water.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Stonehenge on ice ::))</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9200425/steemit/Greenland/ice.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this little insight into Greenland.

    "body": "You are what your friends are.\n\nhttps://cdn.pbrd.co/images/19tOaDNQT.jpg\n\nLet\u2019s be honest here. I firmly believe that the energy you give out, yet get back in life. It\u2019s karma in a sense, but I don\u2019t believe in this invisible force.\n\nOnly that if you give out trust, openness, honesty and much happiness to others, then likeminded people will gravitate towards you.\n\nYour life force is like an energy. If you surround yourself in that energy people that enjoy basking in that type of energy will gravitate towards it.\n\nThat\u2019s why I meet a ton of supremely open and trustworthy people.\n\nI absolutely repel narcissists. I used to be a magnet for them, but I know their deadly secret. I know what they don\u2019t want anyone else to know.\n\nDepth.\n\nhttps://cdn.pbrd.co/images/19v3xPBBM.jpg\n\nA narcissist will never be able to apologise, or accept their mistakes. Anything less and they see it as a competition for top dog. But a narcissist will be able to point out the mistakes of everyone they meet.\n\nI don\u2019t like people that don\u2019t let me venture into their depths.\n\nAnd they hate me.\n\nSo everything\u2019s good.\n\nSo the same can be said if you\u2019re negative. I know I keep saying it, but if you\u2019re a negative person you\u2019ll meet other people that will want to bask in that energy too.\n\nI used to be an overtly negative person.\n\nMy friends would laugh at my achievements, make me feel as if I wasn\u2019t worth much, or put me down in front of other people. They were no friends at all.\n\nhttps://cdn.pbrd.co/images/19ytSjj2e.jpg\n\nThey were nice to me in private though. Because there\u2019s no competition\n\nThey may appear to be a friend, but that\u2019s just for show. Truth be told they like looking better than you.\n\nBut the hard truth is:\n\nYou are beautiful.\n\nThere is amazing in there, somewhere.\n\nI know because I see it in my comments, some quite defiantly say,\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no beautiful in me I think I never had it\u201d or something similar,\n\nYet perhaps you haven\u2019t met the right people yet to yank that the fuck out there for the world to see. Absolutely everyone has some sparkly awesome in them.\n\nI swear I haven\u2019t met a single person yet with no awesome that could be taken and sharpened to a fine point.\n\nhttps://cdn.pbrd.co/images/19zQKLn1k.jpg\n\nWhen my awesome started to surface every now and again I began to enjoy it. And it came to a point that I was mentally requesting my awesome daily to come out and play.\n\nUntil one day, it moved in with me.\n\nAnd this can be you too.\n\nIt all starts with you my friend.\n\nStart by leaving a nice message somewhere.\n\nYou guys are beautiful,\n\nThank you",

    "body": "<h1>The Evolution Of Virtual Economies And Their Future Global Impact On The World</h1>\n\nhttps://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/2/005/087/3c0/3e54334.jpg\n\nAnyone alive in the last twenty years has no doubt experienced the growth of the internet from a basic useful tool into a mammoth sized economic power that has thousands of use cases in our everyday life. However, had you been asked in the 90s if you thought the internet would evolve so rapidly and become such an integral part of our society\u2019s life, most would have scoffed. Many, even today, believe that the internet has stopped growing and most of the essential tools built for it have been created, but to me and others, who are taking notice of the innovation still happening in this space, it is clear this is just the beginning. I see the internet as a base layer of proof that virtual economies can exist and can work to provide livelihood to many around the world, but I see them evolving into something of a science fiction dream. I truly believe that within the next 100 years, we will have fully immersive, borderless and virtual economies that will dwarf the internet of today.\n\n<h1> Immersive Virtual Interconnectivity Between Humans And The Internet</h1>\n\nVirtual reality in the past few years has actually started to become a tangible reality that currently has some use cases, but the evolution of such systems will be the catalyst for a new paradigm in how we interact with the world and each other. The ultimate goal for virtual reality systems would be a system that provided the user immersive access to the internet directly to a point where their consciousness and the internet merge as one. Think of a matrix type of system that can be freely accessed from the comfort of your home, anywhere in the world. This complete immersion would quite literally create a second reality that one could live and interact with. Entire virtual worlds with access to all of our senses and feeling would be created to supply users with a boundless place to build only limited by creativity. With the creation and use of a device like this or something similar the following use cases would completely change the world into something unrecognizable to the people of today. Take in mind less extreme versions of this technology, without the merging of consciousnesses could also do the job, but im going to just assume the best case scenario for what could potentially be created.   \n\nhttps://a2ua.com/ai/ai-001.jpg\n\n<h1>Massive Borderless Labor Markets</h1>\n\nThe first and largest change that would take place would simply be having access to a global labor marketplace with jobs and opportunities presented to people, regardless of where or what country they reside. If decentralized and free of regulation, these markets would have free market pay and ideology prevail. However there is another option which would be to treat various virtual worlds like different countries with options to create governments and provide regulation in those worlds. As an employer or employee you would be able to pick and choose where you wanted to run your business or work depending on which virtual world suited your needs. No longer would you be burdened by which country or area you choose to live in the real world, when a massive job market is accessible virtually in your house.\n\nThe way companies would change in response to this new technology would be immense. The most competitive companies would now have access to the entire labor market which would include the most efficient and smartest workers from all over the world, which they would pay accordingly. Business overhead would potentially be less expensive as well because companies wouldn\u2019t need to house workers during the day in physical buildings, but rather digital ones that could be purchased for cheap. Lower business costs would mean higher profitability which would better economic wellbeing for the employees and in return the global economy as a whole.\n\nhttp://www.hypergridbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Matterport-VR.jpg\n\n<h1> Creation Of An Almost Completely Virtual Retail Economy</h1>\n\nIf we think about how much ecommerce has grown, and is still growing, since the inception of the internet, it is mind blowing. For many years ecommerce was a joke to people and most \u201ccritically acclaimed\u201d investors said it would never take off. Well, it did take off and now accounts for a giant portion of all international GDP. However, there is still something left to be desired with the online shopping experience that is available at in person retail stores. We as human beings still have a desire to touch, feel and most importantly try out products before we purchase them. With businesses that deal in products like clothing, perfume ect. we as consumers want to try the product before we buy it. With a completely virtual retail economy this could be achieved with virtual store fronts and the ability to try on a product before you buy it. Again, because of the lack of overhead for a small business running in one of the virtual worlds, the products would be less expensive and you know how they would fit when they were delivered to you in the real world. However, rather than just delivering you the product in the real world, you could be able to receive a copy in the virtual world as well. We already have a precedence set for virtual cosmetic items in MMORPGs and other multiplayer games. People will flock to the virtual retail economy because it provides them with a use case that is better than what we currently have.\n\n<h1>Virtual Real Estate Markets</h1>\n\nVirtual real estate markets also have a huge potential within the new virtual economies and worlds that will be created. Even though real estate would be able to be created relatively cheaply, storefronts, buildings and other locations that are considered prime real estate will be heavily demanded. There is a precedent set for this idea as well in an MMORPG called \u201cEntropia Universe\u201d , where one of the wealthier players purchased a space station and was able to make an income from it when other players would travel to new planets. Although completely virtual the property has had offers in the hundreds of thousands of dollars range. I foresee the same thing happening with real estate in the virtual worlds created, especially popular ones with millions of people accessing them. The idea of a virtual landlord would actually be feasible if someone was to purchase a lot of land and then rent it out. It would be like if each bitcoin created represented a plot of land and we were able to create buildings on that plot and rent it out. The possibilities with real estate are quite literally endless. Together with the creation of virtual worlds, the virtual real estate market would be massive.\n\nhttp://rebellion.nerdfitness.com/uploads/monthly_2016_04/57026c98a0b2e_Matrixchair.jpg.6fe1d4a62228cc05d0d4cf3348aaf616.jpg\n\nIn conclusion, many of the points I made here for a possible virtual economy might be seen as science fiction, which many of it is. However as we have seen with many technology before, technology inventions seem to stem from science fiction quite frequently. Who knows how different the world will be in 100 years. To put it in perspective, 100 years ago barely anyone was even using a radio, just think about what people 100 years in the future will be thinking about us. If my expectation for reality in the future does come true, I believe we will see what I have written about in the article take place.\n\n-Calaber24p",

We see, feel, taste, <strong>hear </strong>and smell unknowingly how it works. As we were children we called anything into question and now accept reality as it is. We lost the magic in all these wonderful things. This series addresses the wonder of natures and will bring its magic back to light. The second part of the <strong>Life Explorers - The Human Senses</strong> deals with the sense of hearing. We hear and feel sounds, when getting older we steadily lose the ability to hear things like music, that makes us happy. Hearing is important in our daily life, we need it for communication and it can even affect how we feel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To be able to understand why we hear we will investigate the nature and behavior of sounds, the human ear and the physical process behind hearing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just like the eye needs visible light to see, the ear needs sound to hear. Both sound and light are waves by their nature. The main difference is that light is an electromagnetic wave whereby sound a longitudinal, mechanical wave. To further understand the mechanics of hearing we need to have a look into the physics behind it. What is a mechanical wave and what does longitudinal mean? <br>Sound is created by a source that induces vibrations in a medium (<strong>air</strong>, water etc.). These sources are elastic materials, mostly solids, but also can be gases or liquids. By transferring the energy into the air particles the elastic material causes the molecules in the medium to get in motion. By moving the molecule forth it pushes a second molecule that gets in motion too. A chain reaction follows where the force is forwarded from the source through the molecules. You can imagine it this way:</p>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.giphy.com/6rDARxVjfF1F6.gif\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig.1 Illustration of a transversal sound wave. Credits: </em><a href=\"http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/StandingWaves/StandingWaves.html\"><em>Dan Russell</em></a></center>\n<p>This is illustrating a longitudinal wave. Simply put, longitudinal means the particles are moving parallel to the wave. The opposite is a transverse wave, where the molecules move with a right angle to the wave.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The first molecule, however, moves back and repeats until moving back into his equilibrium state. This state is a condition where no forces influence the particle and it remains motionless. The molecules that are pushed back and forth, create a wave of areas of high and low pressure called compressions and rarefactions. The air density is higher at the compression area, because more molecule are located their, while the rarefaction area has a lack of molecules and therefore has a lower air density. The figure below illustrates the areas of high and low pressure of a typical sound wave.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/ltjwgbjux/aipressure.jpg\" width=\"1020\" height=\"468\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig.2 Areas of air compression. Credits: </em><a href=\"http://physics.info/sound/\"><em>Physics.info</em></a></center>\n<p>The absence of a medium renders it impossible to create a moving sound wave since there are no particles to pass the vibrations. R. BOYLES (1627- 1691) showed that this is the reason why we can\u2019t hear in outer space.</p>\n<h2><strong>Let\u2019s have a closer look at the sound waves</strong><br>\n</h2>\n<p>Sound waves contain much information that is essential for distinguishing audible information. We will have a closer look at the basics of waves and how we can determine volume and pitch of a sound. Because waves occur periodically we will use the sine function to describe the sound waves. Sine functions are used whenever we want to describe something repeatable. The basic sine function is y(x) = sin (x)&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/87ig7c2wx/sine.jpg\" width=\"604\" height=\"192\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig.3 Typical sine function.</em></center>\n<p>So far so good, the above function describes the basic sine function, but as I said above sound contains many information. We need to adjust our sine function in order to better describe a sound wave. Sound can be loud or quite for instance or have a high or low pitch. To mathematically describe the volume of a sound we introduce the amplitude A. The amplitude is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values of the function and is vertically stretching the graph. The higher the amplitude the louder the actual sound we hear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>y = A * sin (x)&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/uhtpwhq2r/amplitude.jpg\" width=\"547\" height=\"546\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig.3.1 Sine functions with different amplitudes.</em></center>\n<p>Another way to adjust the graph is by adding more or fewer cycles it completes in a certain time, the period B. The Period is stretching the graph horizontally and is responsible for the pitch. The less cycles the graph has the lower the pitch, therefore the pitch is higher with more cycles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;y = A sin (B*x)</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/9gku8wz5f/pitch.jpg\" width=\"542\" height=\"540\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig.3.2 Sine functions with different periods.</em>&nbsp;</center>\n<p>In the last Life Explorers article we learned that lights travels with around 3.000.000 m/s, this is both right and wrong. The speed depends on the medium it\u2019s traveling through. The following figure shows the speed of sound through different mediums in m/s</p>\n   <table>\n\n      <tr>\n        <td>Aluminum</td>\n        <td>Water</td>\n        <td>Air</td>\n        <td>Helium</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>5110</td>\n        <td>1483</td>\n        <td>344</td>\n       <td>971</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>Why is the speed of sound in aluminum higher than in air?</strong></h2>\n<p>As mentioned sound is created by a source of vibration. These vibrations, however, put molecules in motion by transferring energy from one molecule to another, a chain reaction happens. In solids, molecules have a rigid, fixed position and are packed very tightly. The air molecules are not rigid and have no fixed position. Transferring the energy from one molecule to another is easier in a solid than in a gas, since the next molecule is closer. This is the reason why sound waves move faster in solids. The greater the distance between sound source and hearer, the weaker is the sound wave, because of friction between the molecules the total energy is reducing.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/nvt29gedd/62049a0bf48e2cb0b024d238707590e3.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"610\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig.5 Conditions of aggregations.

We saw that a small period causes a higher pitch and a high period a deeper pitch. The frequency tells us how many periods are made in a certain time. The higher the frequency the more periods are done. The following figure illustrates how the frequency and amplitude are affecting the sounds we hear.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_GD7kgG_0bkc/S71CdOJxevI/AAAAAAAAAVs/eb8P-RSCXl8/s1600/general+graph.png\" width=\"515\" height=\"321\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig.6 Relation between sound and wave.

Frequencies below 20 Hz are called infrasonic and above 20.000 Hz ultrasonic. Besides the having the right frequency we need to have the right loudness. The loudness depends on the amplitude and is measured in decibel. The lowest intensity the human ear can perceive is called threshold of hearing and is defined as 0 decibel. The intensity of sounds depends on:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The source of vibrations &nbsp;</li>\n  <li>The amplitude &nbsp;</li>\n  <li>The medium though which the sound travels &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>The distance between the source and observer</li>\n  <li>Objects between the source and observer</li>\n  <li>Interference &nbsp;<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Interference happens when two sound waves combine. We have two possible ways to combine waves: constructive and destructive interference. Constructive interference increases the amplitude, whereas destructive interference compensate the waves.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/fz3chonlz/inteference.png\" width=\"466\" height=\"286\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig.6 Constructive and destructive interference.

The ear has three parts: The outer, middle and the inner ear. Each with it\u2019s specific function.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/i050b1oj7/b928.jpg\" width=\"1081\" height=\"659\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig.7 Structure of the human ear.

It reaches till the Tympanum (Eardrum). The function of the pinna is similar to a funnel, it directs sound waves into the inner parts of the ear. Another main role is in adjusting the pressure. Within the inner ear the air is compressed and has a higher pressure than outside. The pinna is lowering this pressure difference and makes sure that sound is passed correctly and with less waste of energy. By collecting the sound vibration and directing them into the ear it helps us to decide where a sound comes from. It also functions as a protection to the sensitive inner parts of the ear. It produces earwax, also known as cerumen, which protects again insects, water and bacteria. This way it is assisting in keeping the ear canal clean.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>The middle ear</strong></p>\n<p>The middle ear begins with the Tympanum (Eardrum) and reaches to the cochlea (Inner ear). After the sounds waves are led by the pinna to the middle ear they hit the Tympanum which is a very thin diameter and make it vibrate. These vibrations are amplified in the middle ear and transferred to the ossicles, also known as the three middle ear bones: Malleus (Hammer), Incus (Anvil) and Stapes (Stiddrup). The last bones, the Stirrup is connected to membrane on the inner ear, called the oval windows.<br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>The inner ear</strong></p>\n<p>This is the place where the actual hearing happens. It consists of the Cochlea, the organs of balance and nerves linked to the central auditory system and brain. The oval window is covering the Cochlea, which is filled with two fluids ( endolymph and perilymph). After the sound finds it's way into the inner ear it reaches the cochlea. Within the Cochlea is the organ of corti, which has tiny hairs. When the sound wave hits the eardrum it vibrates and these vibrations go to the middle ear bones. The Stirrup, the last bones, transfers these vibrations through the oval window and to the cochlea. The energy from these vibrations forces the fluid in the cochlea to move, in turn moving the hair in the organ of corti. The movement of these hair causes nerve impulses which are sent to the brain and finally are converted to what we hear.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/hoq7vhfb7/m_1407861046.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"480\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig.8 Section through the Organ of Corti.

Following are some practical use of sound waves:</p>\n<p><strong>Doppler Effect</strong>:</p>\n<p>The Doppler effect is named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler and describes a moving source of sound waves towards an observer. The observer perceives higher frequencies when the source if moving towards, and lower frequencies when moving away from the observer. A common example is the siren of police and ambulances. When approaching towards us we hear a higher \u201csound\u201d and when passing by it decreases in its frequency. <br>\nThe reason behind this effect is in the development of sound waves. When the wave is originated it still has to travel to the observer. The nearer the source means a shorter period for a wave to hit our ears, and the higher the frequency. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/fo1lqpw33/waves_doppler_effect.gif\" width=\"550\" height=\"277\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig.9 Doppler Effect. Credits: </em><a href=\"http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/waves_doppler_effect.htm#.V9MdL4R96Uk\"><em>school-for-champions</em></a></center>\n<p><strong>Cymatics</strong>: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cymatics are pretty cool! The Swiss Hans Jenny took a plate and put a thin layer of particles on it. The same works with a liquid or similar. Then he set the plates into oscillation and tried different frequencies. While it's best to just watch the video and be amazed, the basic idea is that different frequencies organize into different shapes. (Note: This video is not from Hans Jenny):</p>\n<p>&lt;iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q3oItpVa9fs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>Sonography:</strong></p>\n<p>Simply put Sonography uses ultrasound to display the internal body. Frequencies over 20.000 Hz are used in this method. Our tissues reflect these ultrasonic waves differently, depending on the density. Bones reflect the waves differently than muscles do. The echo of the tissue is recorded and processed to an image.&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/20000/velka/ultrasound-93851293381682TzS.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\"/></center>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Author's Note: <br>\nThe Life Explorer Series is a community magazine that brings together writers to post about a variety of topics.

From the influence of Rapunzel to my endless fascination with Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House series, I drew and drew. But I could not figure out how to draw believable braids. You can fake it for only so long.</p>\n<p>When I was about 11, I had an epiphany. Whilst sprawled on top of my grandparents' bed in their magnificent house in Minnesota, it came to me. I don't know how, but I was drawing and decided to put a few interlocking lines together. I wasn't trying to draw braids per se - I had given that up. But braids I drew. And they <em>looked</em> like braids. Once I saw what I had done, I panicked. Would I remember how to do it again? I drew the same sequence of shapes again. Braids! It was like I had spent all my unconscious hours in my brain trying to figure out this braid pattern. Never having had long hair myself or any sisters, I had no one to practice on. My brain must have been putting it together piece by piece over the years, because this winter day was pivotal. If I could draw braids, what else could I do?</p>\n<p>And with that, please enjoy the first time I have done a braid drawing demo.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/Braid1a6054.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"479\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/Braid2b3ba6.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"415\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/Braid31a6d6.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"435\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/Braid42a7db.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"511\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/Braid5aab90.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"514\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/Braid678de7.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"601\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/Braid7dc59b.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"653\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/braid8bd705.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"784\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/braid9e31d3.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"980\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/braid115a68a.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"1268\"/></p>\n<p>And that is how I did it then. I wonder if I have that first successful attempt locked away somewhere with childhood memories in boxes? Maybe one day I'll find it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The funniest thing is that I remember exactly where I was when I figured out a drawing problem that evaded me for years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was the first time I began to really understand how practice pays off.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/braid1279f21.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"935\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Drawings \u00a9 Johanna Westerman 2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/braid136d761.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"553\"/></p>\n<p>I so much wanted long hair when I was little - we twisted yarn into \"braids\" and those were my flowing locks. And I sit here with my hero grandpa.</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "The 0.3.5 update is primarily focused on a new post inspector, some minor tweaks and a few bug fixes. \n\nIf you're unfamiliar with [steemstats.com](https://steemstats.com), I'd recommend you check out the [rest of my blog posts](https://steemit.com/@jesta) to read through the evolution of this tool.\n\n## Improved Post Inspector\n\n![New Post Inspector](http://i.imgur.com/i14vq0K.png)\n\nThe new post inspector is designed in preparation for the upcoming vote changes (in steem 0.14.0) and helping understand the impact votes have on posts. The header is now the post's title (which if clicked, goes to the post), the author, the time posted, as well as a link to the post on steemd.com or steemdb.com.\n\nFor each vote, from left to right, you have the following information:\n\n- The calculated weight of the vote (the bold number), and below it, the vote weight percentage specified by the voter, and the total percentage of weight contributed to the post (in parentheses) .\n- The account who cast the vote and how long ago it was cast\n- The total reward shares contributed to the post by the voter\n- The current/estimated contribution to the author's post reward.\n- The current/estimated curation reward the voter will receive.\n\nThe current/estimated rewards currently only works for posts in the first payout period, but the post inspector now works from both the Recent Activity screen and the Posts screen.\n\n### Bug Fixes & Improvements\n\n- Fixed a bug on the curation stats reward that was displaying SBD.\n- Fixed an issue with comment payout calculations sometimes displaying incorrectly.\n- Removing a watched account now also resets the account followers/following tabs.\n- Fixed a few memory leaks (still more work needs to be done here)\n- Attempt at fixing the timezone problem. For those of you that experienced the time calculations being incorrect, please let me know if the post inspector's dates are now correct.\n- Added link on each post that leads to steemdb.com.\n- Added link on each user that leads to steemdb.com.\n- Added new operation types for 0.14.0 support next week.\n\n### Future of steemstats\n\nI've mentioned this before in a few of my other posts, but never in an update for steemstats itself. Currently I am evaluating the potential of merging steemstats.com and steemdb.com into a single website, focusing both on the realtime and historical aspects in the same tool. \n\nThis somewhat long process has caused me to halt the addition of new features on steemstats, until I fully evaluate if and how this would work. Over the past few weeks I've been actively learning and exploring react, evaluating it as a replacement for angular, which currently powers steemstats. I have also been expanding the APIs on steemdb for an integration regardless of the chosen direction.\n\nWe are currently in the 0.3.x series of steemstats, and 0.4.0 is going to be one of two things:\n\n- A feature rich version of steemstats that integrates the steemdb api endpoints currently being created\n- A brand new, open source version of steemstats and steemdb into a single application (steemdb will become an API)\n\nUnfortunately, 0.4.0 won't likely be ready until October at the very earliest, possibly even later in the year. I have a number of other things to do over the next 30-60 days that will shape the next 6-12 months of my life, much of it involving development on projects directly related to steem. This also means that news on the steemstats front will be going a bit quiet, except for critical fixes and maintenance. \n\nBut - if you have feature requests or bug reports, feel free to submit them. I keep track of it all. I love chatting about this stuff and it's a pleasure to work on a project that serves over a thousand steemians use each day ;)",

And they are winning. History is unfolding according to the aims of these freethinkers and contrarians. People are waking\u00a0up and questioning\u00a0government. They are becoming disobedient and beginning\u00a0to oppose their masters.\n\nThere is proof of this\u00a0paradigm shift.\n\n<strong>The\u00a0Anarchapulco conference in Acapulco, Mexico is rising. It represents the culmination of all the\u00a0rabble rousing and truth-speaking currently under way. It is a result of this\u00a0choir of anarchists singing hymnals of truth and beckoning people into the light of freedom.\u00a0</strong>\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13506\" src=\"https://psychologicanarchist.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/nathan-thumb.jpg\" alt=\"nathan-thumb\" width=\"676\" height=\"380\" />\n<h1>Anarchapulco Highlights, Speakers, and Prices</h1>\n\nWhat is Anarchapulco?\n\nIt is an anarcho-capitalist\u00a0conference held in the last week in February, the 25th through 28th. \u00a0Jeff Berwick, the Dollarvigilante, masterminded and created the event to highlight anarchist ingenuity, compassion, and creativity.\n\nThe conference focuses on\u00a0how anarchists\u00a0are accomplishing their goals, what they are doing to unchain society, live\u00a0more freely, and abolish all government. It features some of the most prominent\u00a0and eloquent orators the anarchist movement has seen. It is world-changing.\n\n<b><a href=\"https://anarchapulco.com/speakers/\" target=\"_blank\">Speakers include</a>, Barry Cooper, Adam Kokesh, Derrick Broze, Roger Ver, Amanda Rachwitz, Larken Rose, Dayna Martin, Jeffery Tucker, Jeff Berwick, Max Igan, Josie Wales, Anarchy Girl, Mark Victor, Dan Dicks, Stephanie Murphy, and many more. I will be speaking as well, and it will be my first public appearance aside from my YouTube videos and writings.</b>\n\nThere\u00a0are also \u00a0workshops and an Ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Barry Cooper called Ayahuascapulco. It should occur on the final evening of the conference. Jeff Berwick will be holding the Dollar Vigilante summit meeting as well. And when night falls, there will be a bacchanalia and other parties to celebrate life, liberty, and love. As an added bonus,\u00a0many of the vendors at the conference will be accepting bitcoin and possibly other cryptocurrencies.\n\nGrab your tickets\u00a0today at the <a href=\"https://anarchapulco.com/buy-your-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">Anarchapulco </a>homepage. They\u00a0are 245 dollars, but students get a special discounted rate. Tickets are also available for the workshops and are on the same link posted above.\n\nI can't wait to meet\u00a0you.\n\n<em>Brave the future! \u00a0Evacuate the State! \u00a0And watch this Anarchapulco informational video below:</em>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-9p8atSEaBQ\n<blockquote>\"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\"</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\nMy name is Sterlin.

I also run\u00a0the<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/psychologicanarchist/\" target=\"_blank\"> Psychologic-Anarchist Facebook\u00a0page</a>\u00a0and produce many\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/psychologicanarchist\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube videos</a>.

    "body": "<center>https://dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Jubilee-Jolt-Dow-Down-400-Stocks-Smashed-In-Biggest-Drop-Since-Brexit.jpg</center>\n\nIt was just two days ago that we wrote, \u201c<a href=\"https://dollarvigilante.com/blog/2016/09/07/gold-biggest-one-day-rally-since-brexit-elites-rush-gold.html\">Gold Has Biggest One Day Rally Since Brexit as Elites Rush Into Gold</a>\u201d.\n\nNow, to end the week, US stocks had their biggest drop since Brexit on Friday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 394.46 points, or 2.1%, to 18085.45, and the S&amp;P 500 declined 2.45%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.5%.\n\nMost pegged the blame on concern over a 0.25% rate hike by the Federal Reserve at their upcoming September 20th-21st meeting.\n\nFederal funds futures, which are used by traders to place bets on central bank policy, on Friday showed a 24% chance of a US interest-rate rise in September, compared with an 18% chance as of Thursday.\n\nEric Rosengren, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston said Friday that \u201ca reasonable case can be made\u201d for raising interest rates to avoid overheating the economy.\n\nOf course, no one asks, \u201chow does an economy overheat\u201d? An economy isn\u2019t a cake. If an economy is \u201coverheating\u201d it would mean that trade is going well, profits are being made and capital accumulated. Why would one want to avoid \u201coverheating\u201d the economy?\n\nWell, the US and all other Western monetary systems are run by a communist-style central planning agency who deem it their task to manipulate interest rates and counterfeit money in response to the perceived \u201coverheating\u201d or \u201ccooling\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s nonsense, of course, and the only shocking thing is that no one has taken the central bankers out into the town square and hung them yet.\n\nBut, in this communist-style system, ALL eyes and ears are focused on the politburo to see what the wise leaders have deemed is best for the rest of us plebs. And this is the case, yet again, as the market has jitters that a rate hike of 0.25% could destroy the entire worldwide economy, monetary and financial system\u2026 a state of affairs that could never have happened without central planning.\n\nEven more hilarious, is the fact that anyone could deem a system with nearly 50 million people on food stamps and nearly \u2153 of the entire public jobless as \u201coverheating\u201d.\n\n<strong>ARE WE IN FOR A MASSIVE CRASH THIS JUBILEE YEAR?</strong>\n\nThe Jubilee Year ends on October 2nd. And, based on our analysis we said that 2016 would be highly volatile, there\u2019d be massive change and all the building blocks towards global government would be put into place.\n\nWe were right, straight off the bat when January was the worst opening month to a year for worldwide stock markets in history. Then, in June, with Brexit, we saw the continued fracturing of the EU (which we were the first to boldly predict on the end day of the Shemitah last year (\u201c<a href=\"https://dollarvigilante.com/blog/2015/09/13/eurozone-collapses-borders-erected-across-europe-on-shemitah-end-day.html\">Eurozone Collapses, Borders Erected on Shemitah End Day</a>\u201d).\n\nAnd the day after Brexit saw the worst one-day worldwide stock market drop in history. Exactly 7 years, 7 months, 7 weeks and 7 days since the Shemitah end-day crash in 2008.\n\nWe\u2019ve profited massively from our analysis, with the TDV newsletter\u2019s Premium portfolio up 200% from a year ago.\n\nOur positions in gold &amp; silver have done very well since the very first day of 2016.\n\n<center>https://dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Gold-One-Year-Chart.jpg</center>\nSince the beginning of the year, gold has risen\u00a024.9% and silver has skyrocketed 37.1%.\n\nAnd bitcoin has also risen nearly 9% since the start of September.\n\n<center>https://dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bitcoin-1-month-chart-The-Dollar-Vigilante.jpg</center>\n\nBut the question is, will we see another massive crash by October 2nd, or soon after?\n\nThere is no way to know for sure, of course.\n\nBut I\u2019ve said for months now that I expect September/October to be a very volatile and dangerous time in the markets.\n\nOnly time will tell if that is the case or not. \u00a0We'll find out early next week if this drop on Friday carries through.\n\nBut, as we warned, be prepared for massive volatility and, potentially, a massive crash during this time period.\n\nMany of our subscribers have been enjoying all this volatility, while most others are living in fear on days like today. \u00a0Here is just one subscriber's comments from our private subscriber's only Facebook group with his gains from just today alone.\n\n<center>https://dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Testimonials-18-The-Dollar-Vigilante.jpg</center>\n\nTo join our group of worldwide vigilantes, many of whom are happy to help you with any questions you may have, <a href=\"http://dollarvigilante.com/subscribe\">click here</a>.\n\nMost people are worried sick this weekend after Friday's market action. \u00a0But here at TDV we are all looking forward to Monday to see if the markets continue to drop in free fall.\n\nBut, even if it doesn't, we are positioned to profit from the volatility which we expect to continue throughout this fall. \u00a0This is not going to be a boring few months ahead!\n\nFollow along with us here at Steemit ( @dollarvigilante ) where Dollar Vigilante articles are posted first before anywhere else.\n\n<center>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jeff-Berwick-The-Dollar-Vigilante-Steemit-Bio-1024x221.jpg</center>",

We've had the opportunity to schedule more than three dozen meetings with developers, community managers and academic institutions. We've also managed to have several long discussions with several of the community groups supporting ETC to get a better sense of commitments, goals and philosophy. \n\nOverall, it's been a really fun experience getting to know a completely decentralized philosophical movement. It's also been illuminating to parse the challenges ahead for the fragile movement as it charts its own path forward. I'll break the report down into what we learned and what we are going to do. \n\n**What We Learned**\n\nCarlo Vicari and I have been trying to map out the total ETC community and also get some metadata about who they are (vocation, age, geography, interests...) so we can better understand the core constituencies. We will publish some preliminary stats sometime next week, but as a rough summary there are currently several meetup groups, a telegram group, a reddit, several Chinese specific hubs, a slack with over 1,000 members and a few other lingering groups. \n\nDaily activity is growing and there is interest in more formal structure. With respect to developers, there are about a dozen people with development skills and knowledge of the EVM and solidity in the developer channel. They have been holding pretty deep discussions about potential directions and roadmaps. The biggest topics are currently pivoting consensus to PoW without the difficult bomb, new monetary policy and also safer smart contracts. \n\nThere is also interest in forming a pool of capital to pay for development efforts ranging from core infrastructure to DApps on top of the system. I haven't taken a position on this effort because we still need to address some governance and legal questions. Regardless of whether this pool materializes, IOHK's commitment of three full time developers will be funded solely by IOHK. \n\n![Democles](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Damocles-WestallPC20080120-8842A.jpg/470px-Damocles-WestallPC20080120-8842A.jpg)\n\nIt seems that the price and trading volume of ETC has held relatively stable despite the virtual sword of damocles that is the DAO hacker and RHG funds. It seems that there is enough community interest in ETC to keep liquidity. I do think there will be tremendous volatility ahead and it's going to be impossible to predict when black swans are going to land in our laps, but I suppose that's what makes it fun?\n\n**IOHK's Commitment**\n\nAfter the initial conversations and analysis, we have determined the following serious deficits with ETC:\n\n1. There isn't an official or reliable channel of information about the events of the ecosystem or commitments of various actors. This reality has lead to FUD, impersonations and attempts at market manipulation in the absence of clarity. \n\n2. The roadmap of ETC needs to include at a minimum an emphasis on safety, sustainability and stability. There is a strong desire amongst the ETC community members we had discussions with to focus on reliable, high assurance applications that run on a network with proven fundamentals. Effectively, this needs to be the antithesis of move fast and break things. \n\n3. There is a desire amongst several well capitalized actors to donate capital to a pool to fund the growth of ETC. This desire has been complicated by the lack of a clear governance structure that will avoid fraud or misuse of funds. Furthermore an open pool would allow funds to potentially become tainted by RHG or Dao hacker donating funds to it. While code is law covers the protocol level use of funds, it does not shield actors from the legal realities of their actions. It is unclear how these funds should be treated or if accepting them would constitute a crime. \n\n4. The media is uncertain how to report on ETC outside of a referential curiosity to ethereum itself . There needs to be a re-branding and media strategy to ensure new users enter the ecosystem with a clear understanding of what ETC is about and how it differs from ETH. \n\n5. Concepts like the replay attack and also new potential technology that could be adopted are not fully understood by ETC community members or general developers. There needs to be actors dedicated to education and explanation.\n\n6. The Ethereum Foundation owns the Ethereum trademark. Further use of this branding could provoke a trademark infringement lawsuit to companies using the Ethereum brand and name. This complicates the formation of a centralized governance entity or steering committee if it chooses to use ethereum classic as its name. It also complicates business commitments to building on the ETC chain. \n\nThere are likely more problems, but these seem to be the most pressing for the time being. They are also compounded by the decentralized nature of the movement, which seems to be a boon for resilience, but a curse for agility. Given this fact, IOHK obviously cannot move unilaterally to address all of these problems; however, we can chart a course and invite the community to follow where they deem reasonable. \n\nThus IOHK is in the process of doing the following:\n\n1.  We have interviewed several community manager candidates and will make our final selection sometime next week. He or she will be responsible for assisting meetup group founders, managing social media channels, broadcasting accurate information, combating FUD, collecting feedback from the ETC community and dealing with media entities. My hope is this position will be defined by its interactions with the ETC community and give us a starting point for timely and credible information at the very least.\n\n2. IOHK is going to subsidize an educator to produce content on ETC ranging from the replay attack to new proposals suggested in various roadmaps. We have one candidate in mind and are finalizing the contract and duration of the relationship. All content will be released under a creative commons license and our hope is to again let this role be community driven. \n\n3. IOHK has had numerous discussions with academic partners about the consensus algorithm of ETC and also the smart contract model. We would like to see if the EVM can be improved to be more secure and that Typescript and Purescript could be used as ETC's smart contract languages representing both a functional and imperative approach to development that maps nicely onto the skillsets of existing developers. We are seeing what types of partnerships are possible in the next few months and will provide an update. \n\n4. We've also spent quite a bit of time looking at Smart contract languages on the horizon. There are some excellent ideas coming from [Synereo](https://www.synereo.com/whitepapers/synereo.pdf) and [Juno's Hopper](https://github.com/hopper-lang/hopper). IOHK has entered into a partnership with Kent University to begin an analysis of Transaction Languages used in cryptocurrencies. We will have a survey report available sometime in Q4 of 2016. This report will form the basis of our organization's understanding of the interplay of smart contracts in cryptocurrencies.  Once available we will release it to the general public as a whitepaper. \n\n5. We have decided that [Scorex 2](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/Scorex/tree/664d035d3a0f1b9580480cd29b15863e9b5cb654) will make a good base to build our ETC Main Client ([Read Alex's First Blog on It](http://chepurnoy.org/blog/2016/09/scorex-2-dot-0-a-full-node-view/)). The core is going through a massive refactoring that will be finished sometime this month. From this point, we will retain a scala specific team (our three developer commitment) to fork Scorex 2 and build a full ETC Node including a wallet with GUI. The architecture of Scorex should allow for much faster iterative improvements and also a great opportunity to test our new blockchain specific database [IODB](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iodb/blob/master/doc/authenticated_structures_and_database_layer.md) .\n\n6. With respect to the developer hires in particular, we have taken quite a few resumes already, but also want to make the process open to the general public. Our new community manager will post the job ad on the ETC reddit once he's been hired. I expect the first developer to be announced sometime in September. Quality scala developers with the requisite skills to make meaningful contributions to Ethereum are rare and require careful vetting. \n\n7. With respect to a technological steering committee to guide the roadmap process, we are proposing the formation of a federated group tentatively called the smart contract engineering taskforce (after the IETF). Ideally we could develop an RFC process to propose improvement proposals from the community without the need for a formal, centralized entity. We'd love to see this form as a DAO. There could be two tracks covering changes requiring forks and changes that are iterative in nature. We will start the discussion about this group sometime in early October. \n\n8. IOHK cannot resolve the trademark issue, but will make a commitment to not use the Ethereum brand or name in its repos or company assets. This said, we would like to see some form of bilateral resolution to this situation. It seems pyrrhic to seek trademark enforcement on a decentralized movement. We also understand the confusion this issue is causing the general public and developers. \n\nOverall, it's been a great two months and I look forward to the next few to see ETC continue to grow and become a strong, stable cryptocurrency. I'd like to thank the awesome community and all their help. I'd also like to thank the people who had enough patience to talk with Carlo and me despite the long meetings.\n\n======\nEdit: Special Shout out to the Ethereum Classic Russian Community: [https://ethclassic.ru/](https://ethclassic.ru/)",

I noticed that almost everyone who visited Barcelona wants to go back to this city. I'm not an exception. Barcelona means incredible Gaudi\u0092s architecture, green parks on the Montjuic where you can find parrots instead of pigeons, it means beaches with endless sea and just a fantastic atmosphere, without which your inner peace seems impossible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/2248a52.jpg\" width=\"801\" height=\"375\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Today I want to tell you about the places you must visit in Barcelona.</p>\n<p><del>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</del></p>\n<h3><strong>Park Guell</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Everyone knows that one of the main attractions of Barcelona is the architecture of Antonio Gaudi, the brilliant and unusual artist who is completely different from his colleagues. His creations decorate Barcelona. There\u0092s even a separate park - &nbsp;the Park Guell, which impresses with its scale and imagination.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/rH5cwzae5cw10bb8.jpg\" width=\"795\" height=\"391\"/></p>\n<p><em>This park was initially conceived by the industrialist Guell as a good &nbsp;business project. He was planning to sell houses in the park. But the local inhabitants decided that the portions of the land were too far from the center and no one wanted to buy the buildings. As a result, it was sold nothing but two houses which were bought by Guell and Gaudi. But, if they lived today, they would be amazed to the success of their own &nbsp;project. Now there\u0092re long lines in the&nbsp;Park Guell and sometimes you have to buy tickets previously.</em></p>\n<p><del>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</del></p>\n<h3><strong>Sagrada Familia (Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Familia)</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Construction of the park started in 1882 and at present time the process of building hasn\u0092t stopped yet.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/FYysH3DFd4Q31ea9.jpg\" width=\"794\" height=\"452\"/></p>\n<p><em>The Spanish Government estimates that it will have been completed only by 2026! This slowness is due to the fact that construction is carried out exclusively on the donations of parishioners. And the number of &nbsp;parishioners is unbelievable. We lined up to the box office and stood there an hour and a half. &nbsp;In the ticket booth we were &nbsp;told that there were tickets only for day after tomorrow! But even if you do not get inside, you should just come to the famous temple and enjoy its grandeur. Having seen &nbsp;it up close, I involuntarily opened my mouth and pulled out the sounds of delight! That was probably the most impressive sight in a long time.</em></p>\n<p><del>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</del></p>\n<h3><strong>Restaurant \u00ab7 Doors\u00bb (7 Portes)</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Here is everything that you need to try if you are in Barcelona: paella of seafood and excellent sangria.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/2W8SW9UnCsU6f61d.jpg\" width=\"799\" height=\"516\"/></p>\n<p><em>This restaurant has been working since 1836 and its visitors deserve a separate discussion.

It has existed since 1217. And you will find it anyway, even if you\u0092re not planning to visit it. It is located next to the main pedestrian Rambla. This market is quite expensive, but here you can find everything you can dream of: the famous ham, fresh oysters and mussels .. mmm ... For 1 euro you can buy fresh juice from papaya and coconut. And at the market entrance there\u0092s a window full of &nbsp;cut fruit (they are sold with a fork)! In this market I spent more than one hour \u0085</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/AXmDsWzFjUE50fbb.jpg\" width=\"801\" height=\"300\"/></p>\n<p><del>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</del></p>\n<h3><strong>Montjuic</strong></h3>\n<p><em>It\u0092s one of my favorite places I\u0092ve ever &nbsp;visited. And I wouldn't mind &nbsp;moving there. Montjuic - a mountain in Barcelona. There you can see the most famous fountain with color backlight, which attracts more and more tourists every evening. Just above the fountain - The National Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC), and even higher - Montjuic treasure,its parks and the museum of the famous Catalan artist Joan Miro. This is the best museum I have ever visited in my life.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/YfRIvOvv-AY86b35.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p><em>And it is not because of the paintings, the reason is the building itself with its terrace, overlooking Barcelona.

    "body": "<center>https://i.imgsafe.org/2fdd34ad55.png</center>\n\n**Beyond Bitcoin hangouts enable everyone's voice to be heard--Steemit lets the community vote on our Top Guests!**\n---\nI have decided to extend this trial run for announcing hangouts in a way that gives everyone an incentive to promote our events and themselves, their projects and alliances that germinate in this very hangout community. So until further notice if you want to be covered in beyond bitcoin hangouts in any serious way, we will be asking for you to upvote this post, RSVP and give upvotes to other projects/topics you find valuable.\n\n**How to get Coverage of your Project:  Leverage Your Community!**\n---\nPost to this and future Hangout Announcements telling us if you are going to be there and what project/topic you would like to cover with the Beyond Bitcoin Community. The highest voted project/topics at the start of the hangout every Friday @ 10am EST will be covered first, followed 2nd highest, 3rd highest...etc in sequence from highest to lowest.\n\n**How much time will we have?**\n---\nHangouts will be at least 45 minutes long, but depending on attendance and projects/topics to be covered may last up to 2 hours. Given this, we will try to be as flexible with guest speakers as possible, but will be forced to limit the number covered in any hangout to 5. This should enable us to at least let people speak/take questions for 25-30 minutes each.\n\n**Is *coverage* all I get?**\n---\nNo. You also get the opportunity to post links relevant to your projects, steemit posts/updates about your project and have those links posted to soundcloud and the steemit thread where the hangout is posted.\nWe might even be willing to promote good projects we cover on twitter and steemit!\n\n**Is any topic off Limits?**\n---\nYes. We reserve the right to learn from the newest trickster trolling steemit consistently searching for way to insert chaos into the equation and devise future strategies for negating these. Naturally if these efforts become ham-fisted attempts at shutting down free speech in honest conversations, the audience will hold us accountable.\nBut with that said....pretty much anything can be covered--even up to and including current events. However, I personally will only be voting up stories that touch the blockchain in some way shape or form and will be asking the community to downvote absolute Rubbish! ;)\n\n**How to Join**\n===\n## **Step 1:**  [Download Mumble Here](http://www.mumble.com/mumble-download.php)\n## **Step 2:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQSilwOySU8\n## **Step 3:** \nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7354/27300935122_5cd4c54644.jpg\n## **Step 4:**\n## **RSVP Below with the following details:**\n----\n### 1. Project/Topic Name/News Piece\n### 2. Relevant Steemit Tag?\n### 3. Appropriate links to share?\n### 4. Steemit and/or Mumble account name of Representative/Speaker\n### 5. How should we Introduce you/your project/your news coverage?\n### 6. Were you referred by someone to our hangouts?  Do they have a steem account? If so post it here to give them part of the SBD earned from this thread!\n\n\n\n## Listen to last week's hangout:\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/281275039&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "body": "<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\nhttp://www.thedigeratilife.com/images/market-emotions-2.jpg\n</div>\nSome people have suggested that we reduce the power down period to improve market liquidity.  I have been thinking about the economics of this and wanted to share my thoughts.  \n\n## Power Down Delay Slows Price Discovery \n\nPrice is the balance point between supply and demand at any given point in time.  The Power Down restrictions have the impact of holding *Supply* off the market.  Much of this *supply* wants to sell at today's price, but cannot.  The reason it *wants to sell* is because those doing the selling have earned a *massive* profit in a short period of time.  Their costs are next to nothing.  They will continue to sell until the price falls low enough that it isn't worth selling.  \n\nIf Steem Power were liquid, then the price would fall toward this equilibrium faster in a *race to the exits*.   The people that dump first win (in the short term) and the rest lose (in the short term).   There will always be a market value and the price will never go to 0 so long as there is at least one person who believes in the *potential value* of the platform.  My experience with BitShares and dozens of other cryptocurrency projects is that nothing with any community behind it will fall to 0.   Even simple Bitcoin clones that have been around for years and offer relatively little innovation with non-existent development teams (Doge, Peercoin, Namecoin) continue to be traded with $100K+ in daily volume with marketcap in the millions.     \n\n## Power Down makes Cashout more Fair \n\nWith a power down system, everyone is forced to \"dollar-cost-average\" their selling over 2 years.  This means that whales that might have cashed out $1M dollars at the height of the bubble were only able to cash out $50,000 at the high prices while they have watched their remaining Steem Power fall in value to $200,000.  Their average \"cashout\" price will not be the height of the market, but the market average over 2 years.  \n\nThis has pros and cons.  In some sense it limits the ability of speculators to buy and sell over periods of a couple of months.  Anyone speculating over more than a couple of days is paying a very large inflation tax.  The loss of this speculative capital impacts the liquidity and potentially the price.  We live in a world where traders want the ability to move to the next big thing and having capital tied up in the *last big thing* is a much riskier proposition. \n\n## Author Rewards\n\nAuthor Rewards are also designed to delay cashout by paying in Steem Dollars.  You could sell immediately at a loss, or you could \"trust and wait\" and make more.   As the price falls, the market value of the immediate author rewards also falls, but this is *OK*.   Authors looking for a quick buck need to go elsewhere.  Meanwhile, those who stay and work to grow the long-term value of the platform will gain in Steem Power.  When the value of the platform finally grows as a result of years of effort they will be the new whales.  \n\nYou may only get $10 worth of Steem Power for a post today.  It might not even seem to be worth your time, but if you and others stick around and grow the value of the platform then one day your $10 will be worth $400 if we grow the platform to Bitcoin scale.  If we grow to Facebook scale it will be worth $4000.   \n\n## Starting a Company\nThose who start a company are paid in shares that are worthless.  They cannot be sold on the market until one day in the distant future the company is successful and has an IPO.  The present value of the shares isn't what the entrepreneurial employees care about, it is the future value.  \n\nLikewise, a farmer who spends millions of dollars on land, equipment, and seeds works day in and day out in the hope that his farm will eventually produce a crop worth enough to justify his time and effort.  The farmer is in the red clear up until the day he brings his harvest to market.   \n\nDon't join Steemit for the quick buck.  Be glad there is someone willing to pay such high prices for a stake in Steem today.  Don't fear the fall in market value, look at the incredible amounts people are still earning.  Don't look at what you have today, look at what you could have in the future.  \n\nSteem is in the early adopter phase, those who work hard and help pull this platform forward will reap what they sow.  \n\n\n## Changing the Power Down Period\n\nIf we were to reduce the Power Down period from 2 years to 1 year or even 6 months, this would dramatically increase the net present value of Steem Power while simultaneously increase the amount of liquid Steem on the market in the short term.   The end result would be faster price discovery, but no one can say whether the new price will be higher or lower than the old price.  \n\nSome people speculate that value that is 2+ years in the future is discounted to near 0 value today (especially in the world of cryptocurrency).   This means that longer time horizons have diminishing marginal utility when it comes to encouraging voters to behave in the long-term best interest of the platform.\n\n## Emotional Response \n\nDespite all the logic in the world, humans have irrational feelings with respect to profit and loss.  Slow steady growth *feels* much better than *rapid rise* followed by *slow steady decline* even if both curves end up at the same final value (long term growth).  I for one prefer a slow steady rise, but that isn't possible until after the *rapid rise* has fully corrected and realigned.  This will take time and won't happen until after fear, desperation, panic, and despondency set in.\n\nThose who know about this emotional roller coaster can ride the waves and maximize their profit, but most people give in to their irrational emotional side and buy high and sell low.  My preference is to sell high and buy low.    \n\nDon't let the market price set your opinion on the value of a platform, instead make rational buy / sell decisions that factor in both short-term trends and long-term value.  This applies to any investment you might consider.",

Internet access in my country is expensive so if you offer people free internet access or wifi pretty much everyone will take you up on the offer so this company struck up a deal with the electoral commission to offer free wifi at all election voting stations\u2026 so that those who were waiting in line would be able to surf the web while waiting\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s really big of them\u2026.\n\n \u2026what\u2019s the catch?\n-\nWell you have to watch a two minute video from their sponsors\u2026\n\nThat sounds reasonable right? You stuck in a queue anyway right?\n\nSo they ask you to register\u2026 this is where it starts get a bit grey for me\u2026 after all you have just had to sit through a message from their sponsors and they made a cool $2 million profit for the day just from their sponsors by the way.\n\nSo the registration is to get your full names, email address etc. is taking it a bit far\u2026\n\nBut wait there is more\u2026\n-\nAs part of the registration you have to accept the terms and conditions\u2026.which we know nobody reads.\n\nIf anyone had read the T&C\u2019s they would have seen the clause wherein you accept and agree to allowing them to install a tracking pixel on your phone, which just by the way can\u2019t even be removed if you format the device.\n\nAt the same time that you agree to have the tracking pixel installed you also waive all your rights to protection of personal information and consent to alleviate yourself of all of the privacy rights the legislators have tried so hard to guarantee\u2026\n\nEssentially you give the company a signed blank check to anything and everything they deems fit to do with your data\u2026\n-\nSimply marvelous\u2026\n\nA sample of the data that is being collected came buy my desk\u2026 \n\nIt contains:\n>All your private details from the registration\nAll your device details\nGeolocation information\nYour web browsing activities\nSites visited \u2013 time on site etc.\nApp activity etc.\n\nThe company now wants to apply data science to categorize and classify you so that they can package you up as a product and sell you to their customers.\n-\n\nSo with you free wifi lunch at the voting booth you end up getting a little more than you bargained for. And the best\u2026 or worst\u2026 part about it all is everybody \u201clegally\u201d consented to it.\n1.2 Million devices were registered in one day\u2026. I prefer to use the terms \u201ccompromised\u201d or \u201cinfected\u201d\n\nI guess the question we need to start asking ourselves next time someone asks us to a free lunch is\u2026\n\nWould Edward Snowden be there? and what would he think?\n-",

    "body": "http://magmauk.com/images/steemit/compass/compassLogo2.png\n\nHi guys,\nsorry for the long break in updates but real life took over for a while and i have been swamped with work. Maybe one day I can sit back, relax and enjoy being a race team rider and manager haha. Maybe... but for now the day job keeps me afloat!\n\nOk so back to the real reason for this post. \n\n**The Compass cup 2016!**\n\nhttp://magmauk.com/images/steemit/compass/winnersCup.jpg\n\nThe compass cup is a once yearly event where all the local clubs from the ACU meet up and compete.\n\nAs all of our clubs are primarily schoolboy clubs the majority of the competitors range from 6-17 years old. \n\nEach year we beg and borrow for sponsorship so as the season is almost over for this year I thought I would give steemit the chance to step in and help the kids out. The club is completely non profit based and as such relys heavily on the good will of the parents and local companys. \n\nhttp://magmauk.com/images/steemit/compass/compass1.jpg\n\nI will still be running the Factory Steemit team for next season and I\u2019m making great progress, but as this is still in the planning stages I wanted to get something going right now! I have put aside my teams work for the next few weeks to help out on this. The race is October 21st so there is a lot to do in a short space of time!\n\nAll the people involved in this are doing this for free, they volunteer their time and energy for the club and for the kids. I think it would be great to give them something back for this effort. Oh and by the way... I'm not riding for the team and I\u2019m not involved in the day on race day! I'm doing this simply to help them out and to promote Steemit. Every single Steem $ from this post will be used and donated to the team.\n\nSo I would like to raise enough sponsorship to pay for the teams shirts and kit. Plus, I thought it would be great to get a big steemit banner made as well to really push the message across. There will be six clubs at race day from across the south east of England. The event will be covered online and also in local publications and newspapers, it's a great chance to promote steemit! :)\n\n\n\nFor anyone who didn\u2019t know my local club is Mid Sussex Motocross Club\nhttp://www.msmxc.co.uk\n\nhttp://magmauk.com/images/steemit/compass/compass2.jpg\n\nFor Mid Sussex Motocross Club there will be 35 team members and a manager representing us for the cup.\n\nThere are 5 riders in each class:\n\nClass | Age group\n------------ | -------------\nAutos | 6 \u2013 8 years\nJuniors | 7 \u2013 10 years\nSmall Wheel | 9 \u2013 12 years\nBig Wheel | 11 \u2013 15 years\nYouth Open | 14 \u2013 17 years\nAdult B | 35+\nAdult A | 17-34\n\n\nOnce/ if we get enough funding I will work on some designs for the kit and post them here to show you guys. All Steem $ earned in these posts will be passed on to the team. I will be doing all the design, ordering and running about for free. As with everyone who helps out at the club it is all voluntary.\n\nhttp://magmauk.com/images/steemit/compass/compass6.jpg\n\nFor these kids it\u2019s an amazing chance to get to ride and compete against the best the south of England has to offer. Their first chance to take on the best! Let\u2019s give them something to remember :)\n\nhttp://magmauk.com/images/steemit/compass/compass5.jpg\n\nAs Always a massive thank you to every single person who comments, follows and votes for my projects. You guys rock and i couldn't do it without you!\n\nhttp://magmauk.com/images/steemit/compass/compass3.jpg\n\nSo please steemit it would be a great start to the Factory Steemit project to be able to sponsor the team event! \nLet\u2019s do this :)\n\nhttp://magmauk.com/images/steemit/compass/compass4.jpg\n\nP.S. \nThe competition shirts.\nhttps://steemit.com/motocross/@b0y2k/steemit-factory-racing-custom-shirt-giveaway-the-redraw-results\nThe shirts from the previous competition are in the printing process now. I will be doing a seperate update about them shortly which will include all the details of the company I am using if anyone wished to check up on myself or my transparency.\n\n**Have a great weekend guys!**",

    "body": "People often notice the many similarities between me and Jesus.  Today, I will attempt to explain the voting power changes coming on the 13th in a parable, just like Jesus would.  \n\nGoing into this, I\u200b want to correct an error in my earlier post on the subject.  In my earlier post, I misunderstood some graphs on the white paper and assumed that the vote target was a \"sweet spot\" and that going above or below it would result in a penalty to voting power.  This, in fact, is not true.  You are only penalized for casting too few votes, not for casting too many.  If you cast more than the target number of votes, your decreased voting power will be entirely offset by your increased number of actual votes.  \n\nYou can read some of the discussion that led to this post [here](https://steemit.com/steem-help/@biophil/announcement-all-votes-will-be-up-to-8-times-more-powerful-in-new-hard-fork) and [here](https://steemit.com/steem/@sigmajin/what-every-user-should-know-about-the-upcoming-change-in-voting)\n\n## <center> **The 5 Curating Brothers** </center>\nImagine for a moment that there are 5 brothers.  These five brothers do all of the curating on steemit.  They all have the same amount of steem power.  In this theoretical steemit system, the total daily reward pool  is $8,500.\n<center>http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--830x553/public/articles/155658114.jpg </center>\n* **Andy** devotes the most time to his curating duties.   He casts the target 40 votes per day.\n\n* **Ben** is not as good as Andy at managing his time and his votes, but he still tries.  He casts 30 votes a day.\n\n* **Carl** doesn't have very much time to delegate to curating.  He casts 20 votes a day\n\n* **David** Has even less time.  He casts 10 votes a day.\n\n* **Frank** barely has any time to devote to curation, he casts 5 votes a day.\n\nIn total, 85 votes are cast every day to award $8500.  Each vote, therefore, is worth $100.\n\n# <center> Brothers Vote Value At the 40 Vote per Day Target</center>\nX | votes cast per day | Median Vote strength | Adjusted Votes Per Day|  total value cast per day\n------------ | ------------- | -------------  | -------------   | -------------\nAndy | 40 | 1 |40 | $4000\nBen | 30| 1 | 30 | $3000\nCarl | 20 | 1 |20 | $2000\nDavid | 10 | 1 |10 | $1000\nFrank | 5 | 1 | 5| $500\n**Total** | **85** | **1** | **85** |**$8500**\n\nNote that, for a fixed amount of steem power and reward pool, Andy is unique in that he cannot earn more money by voting more.  He wouldn't lose money, but the change to his voting power would make any vote above 40 a wipe.  He actually _can_ lose money by clumping his votes.  Ideally, at 40 votes, he should be able to cast every single one of his 40 votes at 100% power by spacing his votes at 36-minute intervals through the day.  If there was a super-Andy who cast 80 votes per day, his adjusted vote value would be the same as Andy's, because he would be unable to cast his full 80 votes and also wait long enough to cast them all at 100%.\n\n# <center> Brothers Vote Value at the 5 vote per day target </center>\nX | votes cast per day |Median Vote Value | Adjusted  |  total value cast per day\n------------ | ------------- | -------------  | -------------  | -------------\nAndy | 40 | .125 | 5 |$1700\nBen | 30| .166 | 5| $1700\nCarl | 20 | .25 |  5 |$1700\nDavid | 10 | .50  |5 | $1700\nFrank | 5 | 1 |5 |$1700\n**Total** | **85** | **.29** | **25**|**$8500**\n\nNotice that, because they are above the vote target, Andy, Ben, Carl, and David all have median vote values below 1.0 Just like Super Andy in the previous example, the \"extra\" votes that they cast above the target threshold attenuate their voting power.  Andy could bring his voting down to 5/day  (just like frank) and be able to cast 100% votes, but it wouldn't really make a difference.  He is not being penalized for casting too many votes.\n\nNote here that the monetary value  of a single 100% vote did go up.  \n<center>\nTo begin with, it was \n<center>\n` 8500 / 85 =100 `\n\nAfter the target change, it is \n\n` 8500 /25 = $340 `\n</center>\nIn this particular case, it went up just over  200%.   However, this increase was insufficient to make up for the 87% decrease in the number of votes that could be cast.  The farther away each brother was from actually casting the maximum number of votes, the less his average influence was effected.\n\nTo use shennanigator's model, if you could cast 40 100% votes per day worth 10 cents each before the change, after the change you would be able to cast 5 100% votes worth 34 cents after the change.\n\nHere are the before and after numbers for the total $ influence exerted by the  brothers.\nx  | 40 vote target  | 5 vote target | %  gain/loss\n------------ | ------------- | -------------| -------------\nAndy | $4000  |$1700 |-57.5%\nBen | $3000  |$1700 |-10%\nCarl | $2000  |$1700 | -15%\nDavid| $1000  |$1700 | +70%\nFrank | $500  |$1700 | +240%\n\n# Lowering the Bar Does not Improve Participation(it just improves how many get over the bar)\n\nBiophil wrote in my previous thread\n> It just depends on total voter participation; if participation goes up (a good thing), the increase won't be 8x. If it goes down (a bad thing), the increase will actually be more than 8x. It's very difficult to predict.\n\nThis is somewhat misleading.  Imagine a classroom with 40 students in it.  At the end of the year, 4 students are scheduled to be awarded a certificate for perfect attendance.  On the very last day, the principal comes into the classroom and announces that, in addition to the 4 students who actually have perfect attendance, 10 students who have been absent 2 days or less will also get the certificate. \n<center>\nhttps://anticap.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/lowering-the-bar.jpg\n</center>\nBy doing this, the principal has not, in fact, increased attendance.  He has merely increased the superficial appearance of attendance by rewarding imperfect attendance the same way he rewards perfect attendance.   In the same sense, the 5-day target does not increase participation.  It merely gives the same reward to lower participation as it does to higher.\n\nIn fact, it disincentivizes high participation.  In the new system, there is less reason for andy to take the time to read and vote on 40 posts.  He can still do so, but why should  he?  He can be like frank, put in much less work, and get the same level of influence.\n\n# I heard the new voting target is helping fight bots... how is it doing that?\n\nIt's really not.  At least, not directly.  It does hurt bots (because most bots are Andys, though I would argue that most Andys are not bots).  Basically, if you're a high power frank, this new target helps you at the expense of _all_ andy's, bots included.  When we say this decreases the influence of bots, what we really mean is that it decreases the influence of _all_ very active curators.\n#  <center>  Which brother are you?  </center>\nIf you look at the charts above, it becomes clear that there are two factors that influence how the change to a 5 vote target will affect each individual voter.\n\n1.  How close are you to optimal voting right now?  If you're an andy or a ben, you're probably going to see a decrease in influence.\n2.  How close is everybody else?  If you're currently  a more optimal voter than average, this will definitely hurt you.  If you're a less optimal voter, this will definitely help you.  \n<center>\n</center>\nIn a world where every poster was an andy, this change would have precisely the type of cosmetic effect @shenanigator and others have described.  If everyone on steemit were a Frank or a Dave, and there were only a few Andy's, this vote would decrease the voting power of the andy's significantly.\n\nAt the end of the day, what you need to take away from this and my other post on the topic is that this change is not cosmetic, or a \"bug fix\", or a way to give users two dollar bills for 8 quarters.  It is a very real re-distribution of influence with very real consequences to active curators.  We should look long and hard at the effects of this redistribution when it happens, because its very possible that some of the best curators here will, to coin a phrase, get Franked in the Andy.",

This was an elaborate scheme of Johann\u2019s Pfizer\u2019s to insure XenTek\u2019s lead in the technology sector (thereby insuring the continued upwards-growth of XenTek company stock) by harvesting technology from the future and bringing it back to their own time. \n\nToday we will find out the end result of this first jump forward in time.  Also, Johann shares some incredible information with his second in command at XenTek, Seth Busby. \n\nI decided to continue this giveaway for one more day\u2026\n\n### Who\u2019s your favorite character so far and why?

If so [click here](https://steemit.com/story/@ericvancewalton/4ziyjc-alarm-clock-dawn-an-original-novel-episode-22) to catch up.* </center> \n\n<center> Are you new to Alarm Clock Dawn? If so [click here](https://steemit.com/story/@ericvancewalton/alarm-clock-dawn-an-original-novel-part-1) to start at the beginning. </center>\n\n---\n\n<center> ![](https://s4.postimg.org/w2mbiyyd9/image.png) </center>\n\n---\n\n\nAdam was stunned by the desperation of these news headlines. He looked up at the bank of monitors that displayed the video feeds from the different security team members' helmet cams, their faces appeared in a smaller screen to the bottom left of each of the five video feeds. Suddenly he noticed that three of the five feeds went blank, quickly one right after another. \n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/hCnLJqJlA1OTe.gif) </center>\n\nAdam spoke into the microphone of his headset, \u201cHey, are you guys all right?\u201d he asked, speaking into the microphone of his headset. Silence was all he heard in return. \n\nOnly two screens were still active. Adam looked carefully at the events unfolding before his eyes. At first he thought he saw a member of his own security team, but the uniform was slightly different, sleeker, and the officer wore a gray lens that was hanging from a thin metal arm and came over one eye. Suddenly only two thoughts rushed into the forefront of his mind\u2014*the UNIFORM and the LENS.*\n\nAdam quickly leaned forward in his chair and reluctantly uttered the words that just came to him into the microphone. \u201cThe uniform and the lens!\u201d\n\nQuickly he saw the remaining two personnel move in closer to the guard. As the guard threw a lightning quick punch, another of the helmet cams went blank. There was so much commotion in the last active screen that Adam couldn't tell what was going on. \n\nAdam was then startled as he saw a familiar face standing in front of the craft's door in the video monitor. It was the crew leader. He blinked three times, just as planned. Adam opened the hatch and was confused as the large man with the square jaw came walking up the ramp with his hands bound behind his back. Following closely behind him was an equally large XenTek security guard with the very same single tinted lens over his eye as the \u201cWorld Wise\u201d news anchor Adam had seen on his Holo. \n\n\u201cJump,\u201d the crew chief whispered with a wild look in his eyes. \n\nAdam panicked. \u201cBut the rest\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cJump. Now!\u201d  \n\nAdam reached over the console and flipped the switch. As he did so, he heard the craft\u2019s engines begin to hum. \n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/K0mOruRosiugU.gif) </center> \n\n\u201cStep away from those controls!\u201d the security guard screamed as he leapt across the craft at Adam. Adam stretched for the red button, barely reaching it with the tip of his finger before the security guard tackled him to the ground. \n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/12JAA1gGLbWMA8.gif) </center>\n\nImmediately there was a pop and a slight vibration as an electrostatic charge again filled the air. Adam felt a thud and searing pain as his forehead hit the edge of the craft's stainless steel console, and the world at once faded to black.\n\n\n### CHAPTER 8 ###\n\n\u201cMr. Pfizer, sir,\u201d Busby said as he noticed a half empty crystal decanter of whiskey and a pair of matching lowball glasses in the middle of the director's desk. Johann was slouched in his burgundy leather chair, staring out the window at the swirling gray sky. The rich leather of the chair creaked as he swiveled just enough for Busby to see his profile.\n\n\u201cHmmpf.  What is it?\u201d the director slurred.\n\nBusby was concerned as he never had seen this boss even tipsy before. \u201cAre you okay, sir?\u201d\nJohann laughed as he struggled to pull himself together and rock himself out of the overstuffed chair. \u201cOh, Seth, of course I'm fine. Jusss feeling a liddle mela-melancholy, hpmph, that's all.\u201d He pulled himself to his unsteady feet. \n\nFor a moment Busby was speechless. This was the first time in over twenty years of working for Johann that he called him by his first name. \n\n\u201cI have some exciting news for you, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Seth, when we're here in this office alone call me Johann. There'll be time for your news later. I have something to get ovv of ma chest.\u201d He slurred. \n\n\u201cOkay, sir\u2014I mean, Johann,\u201d he said, catching himself. Calling him anything other than sir or director felt unnatural.\n\nJohann braced himself on the corner of his desk as he swayed slightly back and forth. \u201cThisss place Seth, well, it's my life . . . all I have.  You see, I have no children, no wife, no real friends. It seems,\u201d Johann chuckled, \u201cpeople feel about me one of two ways. I\u2019m either hated or I\u2019m feared.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat's not true, sir.\u201d Seth said, resting his hand lightly on Johann's shoulder. \n\n\u201cDon't bullssshit me!\u201d Johann\u2019s voice boomed. Seth quickly pulled away and squinted, fanning away the eye-stinging cloud of whiskey vapors. \n\nJohann reigned in his temper and took a long deep breath. \u201cI'm sorry, Seth. You are, sshall we say, differrrnt but a damn good man. Honest, loyal. One of the few people . . . I feel I can trust. In your next paycheck, you will see the first of many subshtantial increases,\u201d Johann said, waving his finger wildly in the air.\n\n\u201cThank you, Johann. I appreciate that, but it's really not necessary.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is necess-necessary, and stop being so damned accommodating. I have eyes everywhere, you know. I've been watching you for years. The way you conduct yourself with the team, despite your, umm how should we say, your sexual preferences, it took me years to come to terms with this. Despite this, I believe you haf whad it takes to . . . to . . . .\u201d Johann seemed to lose his train of thought for a second. \n\n\u201cI'm sorry? I have what it takes for what, Johann?\u201d  \n\nThe director forcefully patted Seth twice on the cheek. \u201cYou have what it takes to sit in this chair!\u201d Johann pointed toward his chair and nodded in encouragement. \u201cGo ahead, give it a try and see how it feels.\u201d  \n\nSeth slowly made his way around the desk and sunk into the buttery soft leather of Johann\u2019s executive chair.\n\n\u201cBut you're going to have to toughen up!\u201d Johann barked.\n\nThe look on Seth's face registered true bewilderment. \u201cBut sir, I mean, Johann. I could never . . .\u201d\n\nJohann smiled as he looked at Seth across the desk and chuckled. \u201cOh son, you can and you will. I will have it no other way. Let me share with you a secret that took me nearly ten years of mistakes and hardship to discover.\u201d \n\nBusby leaned in close, transfixed as Johann's mood became noticeably somber. Johann straightened his pocket square and took a deep breath. \u201cThe most difficult lesson for me to learn was the need to graduate beyond the comfortable world of moral absolutes. As messy and confusing as it makes things at first, reality just isn't black and white.\u201d Johann sat on the edge of his desk to steady himself.\n\n\u201cWhen you sit in this chair, you'll be measured by only one thing: the rate of return you provide to the shareholders. In the end, this is all that matters. The faster you come to terms with this, the easier it will be. If you want to be a success and sleep well at night, you must learn that in the world in which we operate there are only shades of gray. The truth is so much more complex than you could even comprehend right now, but the time will come soon when you will find out.\u201d \n\n---\n\n<center> ![](https://s18.postimg.org/9phdrughl/TBC.png) </center>\n\n---\n\n*Alarm Clock Dawn is the first novel of a trilogy.

But most of the day is hard work is sorting through the new section of steemit, basically trying to figure out if a post is legitimate or not. There's a few \"tells\" whether or not a post is more likely to be plagiarized (e.g. a new account), or a spun article (e.g. broken english), and sometimes it's just intuition.\n\nAnother part of the day is unfortunately drama, and trying to convince people that what we are doing is justified. Not everyone cares about producing original content, and a lot of people don't mind if someone gets paid for someone else\u2019s work, and sometimes there isn't much we can do to change their minds.\nAnd finally, we also try our best to generally help people. For example, people who have been unjustly flagged (see the r4fken case), we upvote them to unhide their posts/comments.\n\nSM:\n**Do you think your anti-plagiarism, anti-ID theft campaign is bearing fruits?**\n\n@anyx:\nI don't think we have made any significant progress. Guiding new users in the right direction is one thing, but unless our message reaches the higher ups, we are fruitless in our endeavours.\n\nThe majority of whales are unconvinced in what we are trying to accomplish (@steemcleaners only has a very select group of followers and helpers), and furthermore, some whales go completely against our ideology. For example, one whale upvoted a bunch of recipe articles, to hundreds of dollars each. Within the same day, we saw a flurry of new accounts created that were just plagiarizing recipes, literally spamming tons of plagiarized content, hoping to \"catch\" said whale.\n\nAnd it worked. The whale upvoted many of the plagiarized recipes, and these spammers were rewarded. Sadly, when an average user sees this happen -- when spammers get rewarded, and they get nothing for their hard work -- they get frustrated and probably get tempted to leave the site. That's possibly contributing to the downturn in activity and price here.\n\n<br>\n\nSM:\n**What from your own perspective should steemians look out for before upvoting or flagging a post?**\n\n@anyx:\nI say this over and over again, but no one listens. And I expect once again that no one will.\nStop upvoting things without first considering who the poster is.\n\nThis isn't facebook or reddit, your votes aren't worthless. They mean something, and you should take consideration on what you are rewarding, as what gets rewarded will be incentivized to continue, just like I mentioned with the recipe example. The more plagiarism gets upvoted, the more we will see of it. But on the other hand, the more that good, original content gets upvoted, the more of it we will see. So be selective, you are literally shaping the future of steemit with your votes.\n\nI have noticed that most people don't bother to flag spam or plagiarism, and that is sorely disappointing to me. Do take the time to flag spam, at the very least. We are witnessing a \"bystander effect\" where everyone is watching this garbage appear but almost no one is taking action to stop it. \n\nSM:\n**How's cheetah doing?**\n@anyx:\nCheetah is running along as good as she has ever been. A lot of her actions recently have been for flagging spam, and I am hoping to work on some more advanced features for this shortly. Not much to say about her, as I've been less active these past two weeks due to real life obligations, but more will come soon. :)\n\n<br>\n\nSM:\n**Which blockchain based features would you like to see as soon as possible?**\n\n@anyx:\nThis is a tough question. There was a lot of talk on some potential censorship that came with \"negative voting\" or \"vote cancelling\" that was discussed recently, and I agree that these things need a lot more consideration before they are implemented. That may come to a surprise to many of you whom consider me to be some sort of thought police or even \"hitler\"; but yes, I am against actual censorship.\n\nThe blockchain based feature here on Steemit that I would most look forward to is a more fluid way to use the witness list for rewarding Steemit activities. Right now the list is quite static, and the reward that the small oligarch gets is quite large. I would much like to see the oligarch break into a more decentralized approach, such that other users and projects would have access to the witness funds.\n\nI know many people would use their witness funds for good projects. For example, if I were a witness I would use ALL the funding to reward anyone fighting abuse. The robinhoodwhale or curie projects could use the funds as power to curate better. Many developers not in the top 19 are doing absolutely fantastic work too. But unfortunately, I do not even know where a lot of the funding is currently going -- so a smarter, more transparent, and more decentralized approach here would be very cool.\n\n---\n\nThanks @anyx for taking the time to have an interview with SteemMag. Great job you\u2019re doing. All the best\n\n---\n<br>\n\n<h2> Steemians Speak \u2013What\u2019s Your Fondest Memory On Steemit</h2>\n\nhttps://s14.postimg.org/o30wf6d75/CUPCAKE.png\n\nDespite the various issues we\u2019re facing on Steemit, we\u2019ve all had really exciting times on Steemit. To look at this weekend\u2019s theme from another perspective, SteemMag reached out to a number of Steemains asking them:\n\n<h2> What\u2019s Your Fondest Moment on Steemit?</h2>\n@camilla \nMy best Steemit memory must be finding @stellabelle\u2019s posts when I first joined this community. She was one of the first women I saw posting on Steem and she was brave, free, honest and full of great ideas. She encouraged me to start writing and creating my own work. Thank you StellaBelle!\n\n@anduweb \nMy first whale upvote. \nI remember having the idea to create steem.ly and having this nervousness to get the domain before anyone else, deploying the app and writing the announcement post. Many hours in the making and it was a great idea to not clog messages with long ugly links but list them simply with a cool looking short link like steem.ly/xyz. \n\nI remember reading the post dozens of times before pressing Post, tweaking it to perfection. After posting it, i had the post on one screen autorefreshing the page and steemitx on the 2nd screen constantly checking the stream of votes from the filtered list of whales. My heart was in a tight grip, waiting to see what recognition it gets.\n\nI kept staring at the screens for hours and at one point I laid back on the couch still looking at the monitors, falling asleep in shots (it was way past midnight) waking up from time to time. \nAnd in a sleepy glance i saw it, an upvote from @dantheman. I jumped from the couch and confirmed it. I screamed of joy inside. I would have done it loudly but everyone else was asleep and would have called me crazy. But I am crazy. Steemit crazy. #steemon\n\n<br>\n@dwinblood:\nThey are a moving mass that vie for which one excites me the most, Larken Rose joining, wow this is real I'm making money, my @chaospoet resurrection actually working and being an unusual outlet, and the acceptance and reception of the steemit community for articles personal in nature I was expecting ridicule and instead received support.\n\n@ash \nmy [first post]( https://steemit.com/technology/@ash/hello-world) and to learn and see what Graphene Technology is capable of\n\n@mrwang \nMy fondest memory on steemit is actually a tie, lol... \nWhen I found the-alien post \"zen and the art of not giving a fuck\" not only did it inspire me to write and re-release a very personal video dedicated to my grandmother but was literally a blueprint of my climb to success as an Actor/Filmmaker Episode 5 Goodbye American Beauty of my awareness campaign #nobodysperfect \n\nThe other was the moment I realized how much of a positive influence I became when I took a huge gamble by releasing Episode 1 - Awareness steemit.com \u2026 I didn't know how the community was going to receive it and what I did was open a door for others dealing with similar struggles to feel confident about sharing those struggles with everybody on Steemit.\n\n<br>\n\n@romanskv \nWhen I received the high evaluation of this artistic [work]( https://steemit.com/art/@romanskv/hi-steemit-i-present-to-you-my-outsider-works)\n\n@illuminaughti \nThe moment that sticks out for me was when I had my first \u2018big hit\u2019. I was at work when I saw the payout go up to $200 and started to have a \u201cmanic attack\u201d. My head was spinning, my cheeks were flushed. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I went from being unsure if I could buy food this week to being paid for creating something I was passionate about! You always remember your first!\n\n@sauravrungta \nThe discovery of Steemit itself is the fondest memory. I remember the day I came across this site and was completely blown away. I couldn't sleep that night and the whole week that followed!\nWithin Steemit itself, my fondest memory was when I received my first compliment for my article. This was so new to me and having people actually appreciate your content is just wow!\n\n@royaltiffany\nMy fondest memory of Steemit, was when I discovered it. The novelty, the excitement of finding something new, the research and all the questions...it was a thrill!\n\n\n---\n\n<h2>This Week On Steemit</h2>\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/07/30/THETRAVELLER26edca.jpg\nA lot of interesting events happened this week.

    "body": "<center>https://s21.postimg.org/u24cdappj/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_John_D_Rockefeller_2.jpg</center>\n\nNumerous sources consider John D. Rockefeller as being the richest person in modern history ([Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/carlodonnell/2014/07/11/the-rockefellers-the-legacy-of-historys-richest-man/#33c0aa8160e7) is one of the sources). Adjusted for inflation, his net worth would be north of $300 billion today. Rockefeller lived between 1839 and 1937 (died age 97). \n\nHe made his immense fortune in the oil industry; Rockefeller was a dedicated philanthropist. Leaving aside historical facts (not the point of this post), I will delve into his daily routines, as he told them to Orison Swett for his early-1900s book [_How They Succeeded_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/140698275X): \n\n_\"The riches man in the United States, John Davidson Rockefeller, has consented to break his rule never to talk for publication; and he has told me the story of his early struggles and triumphs, and given utterance to some striking interesting observations anent the same.\"_\n___\nEarlier in this series:\n\n#### 1.

Rockefeller\n\nSome of his biographers claim that Rockefeller followed a strict routine during the last 40 years of his life.\n\n**6 A.M.** Wake-up and read the newspaper.\n**8 A.M.** Breakfast, followed by a puzzle game (numerica).\n**9 - 10:15 A.M.** Working through correspondence. He would often receive thousands of letters per day. Can you guess what they were about?! \n**10:15 - 12 P.M.** Play golf.\n**12:15 - 1 P.M.** Bathe and afternoon rest.\n**1 - 2:30 P.M.** Lunch and another puzzle game.\n**2:30 - 5:30 P.M.** Reading more correspondence (30 minutes) and motoring. \n**5:30 - 6:30 P.M.** Rest.\n**7 - 9 P.M.** Dinner and more rounds of numerica.\n**9 - 10 P.M.** Listen to music and chatter with guest.\n**10:30 P.M.** Lights off. \n\nCredits to [Jonathan Roseland](http://www.limitlessmindset.com/limitless-characters/79-8-life-hacking-lessons-from-the-richest-man-ever.html) for the data. \n\nIf you've been following my series on the habits of remarkable figures, you can notice a stark resemblance between J. D. Rockefeller and Charles Darwin's routine. \n\nHowever, I should be careful to point out that this routine was followed in the second part of his life (the last 40 years), when he might not have been so actively involved in business like he was in his earlier years. I did not find data on his daily habits as a younger person. \n___\n## Interesting to Note\n\n- he was the son of a con artist/bigamist. According to [history.com](http://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-john-d-rockefeller):\n\n_\"The tycoon\u2019s father, William Avery Rockefeller, was a traveling snake-oil salesman who posed as a deaf-mute peddler and hawked miracle drugs and herbal remedies. The smooth-talking huckster dubbed \u201cDevil Bill\u201d alternately fathered children, including the future industrialist, with his wife and mistress, the couple\u2019s live-in housekeeper.\"_\n\n- he was a devoted religious believer\n- he abstained from consuming alcohol and tobacco\n- he donated up of $500 million to philanthropy\n- as young kid, two of his ambitions were to live to 100 and to make $100,000 (a lot of money for that time period):\n\nHe achieved his second ambition, that of making 100 grand, in his early years. Very close to accomplishing his first ambition too, Rockefeller died age 97 (of arteriosclerosis). \n___\n## Ending Thoughts\n\nI'll end leaving you with a great line that Rockefeller told Swett during their discussion - as presented in [_How They Succeeded_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/140698275X):\n\n_\"When I asked Mr. Rockefeller what he considers has most helped him in obtaining success in business, he answered: It was early training, and the fact that I was willing to persevere. I do not think there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as the quality of perseverance. It overcomes almost everything, even nature.\"_\n___\n### <center>To stay in touch, follow @cristi</center>\n\n#story #life #success #habits \n\nCredits for Image: [Oscar White via Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/John_D_Rockefeller_by_Oscar_White_c1900.jpg)\n___\n[Cristi Vlad](http://cristivlad.com), Self-Experimenter and Author",

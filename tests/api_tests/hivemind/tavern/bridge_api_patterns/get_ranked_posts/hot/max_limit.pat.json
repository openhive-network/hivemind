    "body": "<center>https://dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crisisinbound-676x374.jpg</center>\n\nIn past issues, we\u2019ve documented increasingly concerned billionaires warning of dangerous economic times. Many have favored gold as an alternative allocation in a world where $13 trillion-worth of debt is negative yielding, interest rates are artificially suppressed and we\u2019re on the brink of major wars.\n\nThe newest addition to this gold-loving billionaire's club, is none other than hedge-fund manager Paul Singer. At CNBC\u2019s Delivering Alpha Investors Conference this week, the founder of the $27-billion Elliott Management Fund, the 17th largest hedge fund in the world, mentioned that at current prices gold is \u201cundervalued\u201d and \u201cunderrepresented in many portfolios as the only ... store of value that has stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nSinger, along with numerous other hedge-fund managers, has been increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the Federal Reserve and other central banks for creating dangers in the market unlike any in what he terms the \u201c5,000 year-ish\u201d history of finance. Singer noted that \u201cit's a very dangerous time in the global economy and global financial markets.\"\n\nThis quote is frighteningly similar to the response given by Donald Trump on Fox Business not long ago when he was asked if he had money in the market. He answered, \u201cI did, but I got out,\u201d and then went on to say that he expected \u201cvery scary scenarios\u201d for investors.\n\nSinger also stated that he thinks owning medium- to long-term first world debt is a \u201creally bad idea\u201d... and then proceeded to tell listeners to sell their 30-year bonds.\n\nEarlier in the conference, prior to Singer, Ray Dalio who is the manager of the largest hedge fund in the world, Bridgewater Capital, was also vocal about the diminishing returns provided by government debt held by central banks. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can squeeze out of the debt cycle,\"  he said. He went on to say that central banks are at a point now where their ability to stimulate is limited.\n\nSeated next to Dalio was Former Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who voiced concern about limited  \u201ctools in the keynesian arsenal,\u201d that  probably wouldn\u2019t be enough to offset the next recession.\n\nGeithner obviously believes that a recession is on the way. Dalio and Singer are trying to convey the same message. A massive crunch is looming.\n\nWe agree with them, although we believe Geithner was sugarcoating what\u2019s to come.\n\nAfter all, we are on the precipice of a crash of biblical proportions according to the former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, William White.\n\nWe have mentioned his quote numerous time here at TDV but feel it\u2019s important to reiterate because of its magnitude: \u201cThe only question is whether we are able to look reality in the eye and face what is coming in an orderly fashion, or whether it will be disorderly. Debt jubilees have been going on for 5,000 years, as far back as the Sumerians.\u201d\n\nAs the Fed considers its second rate hike in 10 years, Singer condemned policy-makers for acting with \u201camazing arrogance\u201d when he and others had warned of a mortgage crisis prior to 2008.\n\nWhat he and those who agreed with his stance don\u2019t know, or at least won\u2019t state publicly, is that these shoddy central bank policies are detrimental by design. In other words, their sole purpose is to destabilize the world economy.\n\nThis deliberate market sabotage is necessary for the transference of power from the more developed nations to less developed ones. Ultimately, the idea is to eliminate smaller regional and national central banks. Once things get bad enough, these smaller banks will be blamed for provoking a given crisis.  And, secondarily, the end goal is to blow up the entire system in order to bring in the one world government and central bank.\n\nThe elites have used the same tactics time and time again throughout history. First, they create the problem, then there is a reaction, and then finally they come swooping in to \u201cvaliantly save\u201d the day. It's happened numerous times before.\n<center>https://dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1998_Time-MagCover_Greenspan-committe-save-world-The-Dollar-Vigilante.png</center>\nAnd it will soon happen again.\n\nOf course, the globalists have demonstrated that every intervention only makes situations worse.\n\nWe reported on the blatant thievery going on at Wells Fargo in our last article and noted how the elites were probably laughing hysterically at what they\u2019re able to get away with. They were even able to convince many younger American voters that \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d would be their savior, as seen by the significant, youthful support for Bernie Slanders. Debt and currency crises have already started to materialize, as we\u2019ve seen in the socialist utopia that is Venezuela. If this is any indication of what\u2019s to come, the future is looking awfully gloomy.\n\nAs Singer and others including Dalio have mentioned before, the most tried and true measure of wealth and value is gold.\n\nAt TDV we provide unique Austrian-economics based analysis from the anarcho-capitalist pespective of the state of the world\u2019s economy, as well as suggestions on how to protect your assets in these tempestuous and unprecedented times.\n\nJacob Rothschild, a member of the family partly responsible for the creation of all this chaos, even said himself that we are in \u201cuncharted waters\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to predict the unintended consequences of very low interest rates.\u201d\n\nWe have a pretty good idea of what the consequences will be and we\u2019re taking action to protect ourselves and even profit from them.  Rothschild seems to know the consequences, as well, as he has been buying up gold and selling the stock market and the US dollar.\n\nYou can survive and profit from the orchestrated collapse too.<a href=\"https://dollarvigilante.com/subscribe\"> Subscribe to TDV\u2019s newsletter here</a> to receive constantly updated information on how to protect your family and friends.\n\nIn the end, it is getting truly bizarre just how many billionaires, central bankers and others of note are all warning of the coming collapse. We\u2019d almost begun to worry that they were going to pull a switch-a-roo on us, but if you asked the great majority of investors and financial analysts, they\u2019ll tell you that they see nothing but smooth sailing ahead.\n\nSo, while many are warning, many are hearing, but not listening.  The bible said something about that, I believe.\n<center>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jeff-Berwick-The-Dollar-Vigilante-Steemit-Bio-1024x221.jpg</center>",

    "body": "@herpetologyguy\n\nOne of my many tasks as a zoo keeper is connecting people to animals. \n-\n<html>\n\n\n<p>The museum I work at is unique because we showcase animals that are native to Virginia -- meaning that these are animals people will find close to home, rather than across the ocean in some distant country. This makes my job more crucial in that I am responsible for educating people about the reptiles and amphibians that they will find in their own backyards. And obviously, there\u2019s one group of reptiles that gives people more pause than almost any other animal . . . .&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Snakes.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj   &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>I do public programs featuring snakes quite frequently. &nbsp;I believe people should know how to identify local venomous/non-venomous snakes, their role in the environment and how to deal with them when they are in close proximity to our homes. &nbsp;Usually, I get eager audiences asking great questions. &nbsp;But, every now and then, I get some idiot who tells me, \u201cI saw that same snake in my backyard! I chopped off its head with a shovel!\u201d</p>\n<p>Are they an idiot for killing the snake? &nbsp;Not necessarily . . . I don\u2019t know the situation behind the encounter. But, only an idiot would walk into a wildlife facility, approach a zoo keeper and proudly declare that they kill the very same animals that the keeper is charged with the care for. &nbsp;Would you walk into an animal shelter and tell someone working there that you enjoy stomping on puppies? &nbsp;To us, there\u2019s not much difference\u2026&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com\">Credit</a>\n</p>\n<p>The best we can do in these situations is to try to educate people. This can be difficult because so many people are set in their ways -- plus we have to combat an instinctive fear and prejudice against snakes. &nbsp;So, I\u2019m going to briefly lay it all out for you and tell you \"<em><strong>Why you shouldn\u2019t kill that snake in your yard.</strong></em>\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s ILLEGAL in most states to kill a wild snake, unless that snake presents an IMMEDIATE threat.</strong></em> &nbsp;And no, a snake crawling through your yard does not represent a good enough excuse to use force. &nbsp;We\u2019re talking about a situation where a venomous snake is about to strike and you have no escape route but to fight your way out. &nbsp;And guess what, that really doesn\u2019t ever happen (barring instances where someone purposefully provokes an animal). &nbsp;Wildlife and law enforcement agencies are cracking down on people killing snakes, so it\u2019s better to keep yourself out of trouble.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>2. &nbsp;<em><strong>You are putting yourself in harm\u2019s way. &nbsp;</strong></em>The vast majority of snake bites occur when people attempt to capture or kill snakes. &nbsp;If left alone, the snake CANNOT hurt you. &nbsp;Call wildlife services or trained professionals to remove the animal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>3. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s an incredibly beneficial animal, and you\u2019d be foolish to kill it.</strong></em> &nbsp;Small snakes eat a huge variety of pest insects that destroy gardens, while large snakes typically feed on rats and other rodents that infest our homes. &nbsp;If you see a large snake hanging around, you have a rodent problem; snakes will not hang around if there is no food source. &nbsp;To keep snakes from being attracted to your property, do your best to remove any shelter or food sources that would attract rodents. &nbsp;Some snakes even eat other snakes, and species like the harmless king snake will even feed on venomous species!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImOj1CKTBqE\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>4. &nbsp;<em><strong>Another snake might show up.</strong></em> &nbsp;Snakes will not typically inhabit the same area in order to avoid competition. &nbsp;If you kill that harmless rat snake, but you still have a food source nearby, another snake may move in to make use of that source. &nbsp;The new snake may be another harmless species or something a bit less desirable. &nbsp;So why not let that harmless snake take care of the infestation for you?</p>\n<p>http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>Having a snake around can be hugely beneficial to you. &nbsp;It is a free, environmentally-safe form of pest control. &nbsp;Snakes, including venomous species, are non-aggressive animals (unless you provoke them) that will actively do their best to AVOID people. &nbsp;A resident snake will often go unnoticed by homeowners, and most encounters are fleeting glimpses of the snake making a hasty escape. &nbsp;Remember that snakes have their own unique role in the environment, and regardless of our own fears and feelings towards them, they are a necessary part of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg &nbsp; <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org\">Credit</a></p>\n</html>\n\nif you liked this also please check out:\nhttps://steemit.com/science/@herpetologyguy/what-are-herptiles-indentifying-reptiles-vs-amphibians\n\n\n***don't forget to follow @herpetologyguy***",

While I didn't get to read or see the article until someone mailed me a physical copy, I found out that my article had started a number of discussions and follow-on commentary.\n\nDuring my stay at Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp I observed many economic theories put into effect by inmates and the prison administration, including Gresham's law, hyperinflation, currency exchange, and others.\n\nThere are two markets in prison, the \"Administration Run Market\" (ARM) and the \"Inmate Run Market\" (IRM). \n\nFor the ARM, family and friends can add money to your account through Western Union, MoneyGram, or mailing a check. These funds get added to your account fairly quickly and can be used almost immediately, however with a strict spending limit. You get 300 minutes of phone use per month for about $70, and email costs about $0.05 a minute and is only available at specific times to specific people. Once a week you can shop in the commissary with a $360 a month spending limit. Further, certain products have limits of how much you can buy, for example the Mackerel (described below). Alternatively, the IRM is where you can buy sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, Italian ices, hire a personal trainer, get a haircut, pay someone to clean your cube, repair a watch, even inmate run caterers for your birthday or going home party. Additionally there were inmate run 'stores' which sold commissary items at a markup since you could only commissary shop once a week.\n\n[![mackerel-203x300.png](https://s18.postimg.org/pkn7zm1h5/mackerel_203x300.png)](https://postimg.org/image/iu6qq6eb9/)\n\nThe Mackerel (meaning literal packets of fish) is one of the competing currencies in the IRM. It has utility by being one of the best sources of protein on the compound. You can save it for a long time, the shelf life is a few years. The price is relatively the same across all prisons in the country, so even if you transfer prisons your property comes with you, including your Mackerel which is worth the same somewhere else. Unlike tunafish, chicken packets and protein bars, more people eat Mackerel. Those other food items can be used as currency as well, for example the guy who fixes your watch may only accept protein bars because he hates fish. There was even a form of digital currency being used, which I will discuss in another post.\n\n[![pzyQaHU.png](https://s15.postimg.org/tggsqn3uj/pzy_Qa_HU.png)](https://postimg.org/image/nfj3tkh87/)\n\nUtility and medium of exchange give it some value but what about scarcity ? If there is a virtually unlimited amount of Mackerel in the IRM, just like the Federal Reserve printing money, there is no scarcity and hyperinflation can occure if it is debased. \n\nUsing a simple equation, 467 (Number of Inmates) * 14 (Maximum Quantity Allowed to Purchase Per Inmate) * 52 (weeks, assuming every inmate buys the maximum mount of Mackerel every week)\n\nSo if in 2015 we assume that the Supply and Velocity grows at the exact same rate with the Price Level and Transactions unchanging, the amount of Mackerel would essentially double on an even inflation rate. This does not factor in the 3 year shelf life, where expired Mackerel becomes a secondary currency. I will discuss in my next post. \n\nI like to believe that the value of money is determined also psychological factors, like a commodity and not only by mechanical or mathematical factors. In prison many of these psychological factors come into play.\n\n[![1867-1967-Ten-10\u00a2-Cents-Commemorative-Centennial.jpg](https://s15.postimg.org/yqgpkthrv/1867_1967_Ten_10_Cents_Commemorative_Centennial.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/ceiwrfinr/)\n\nMost people use Mackerel as a day-to-day currency for normal transactions, but for reasons I will explain in my next post, they are not the best long term store of value which is important for a currency. For longer term store of value, many inmates use stamps. Stamps have a set rate by the United States Postal Service and have similar characteristics as Mackerel aside for being edible. However, with the introduction of email on the compound many people stopped writing letters as email is cheaper and faster therefore reducing stamps ability to be a transactional currency as a majority of the inmates have no use for them. As a store of value they still hold weight because they are small and easy to store large amounts, while Mackerel is not.\n\nThe biggest value stamps have is that they can be mailed home and your family can redeem them for dollars as the local post office, but that feature can be stopped by better mail screening and overnight the stamp could lose its store of value utility. \n\nIn my next post I will discuss how currency exchangers work, what happens when the prison administration purposely floods the market, and how a secondary currency was created out of expired Mackerel called \u201cMoney Maks\u201d",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good afternoon Steemit, I am officially done breast feeding and am ready to get rid of the last few pounds that are still hanging on from my pregnancy so I have been trying out different ways to cut calories from my diet without loosing flavor. Spaghetti squash is a great substitute for pasta or in this case rice. Spaghetti squash has about 40 calories per cup while rice has upwards of 200. It also has fiber, potassium and vitamins A and C. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For chicken:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1lb chicken breast</li>\n  <li>1 tsp ancho chili</li>\n  <li>1 tbs olive oil</li>\n  <li>1 lime (juice and zest)</li>\n  <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For squash:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1 spaghetti squash (cut in half length wise and seeds removed)</li>\n  <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>\n  <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preheat oven to 425F. &nbsp;In a baking dish, sprinkle chicken with ancho chili. &nbsp;Mix together oil, lime zest and juice and garlic. &nbsp;Pour mixture over chicken. &nbsp;Drizzle olive oil over squash and season with salt and pepper. &nbsp;Place cut side down on baking sheet. &nbsp;Bake a together for 30 min. &nbsp;Shred squash with a fork and put in the bottom of bowls. &nbsp;Shred chicken with forks and put on top of squash. &nbsp;I added cheese, salsa and guacamole to ours but you can top with anything you like. &nbsp;Enjoy!</p>\n<p>https://puu.sh/rcmnK/c059def2e0.png</p>\n</html>",

Its mission is to help reward content creators who are posting great original content, yet who have not yet become established. In the short time since Curie began, our writers group has partnered with @nextgencrypto and other whale accounts to bring rewards to these deserving authors. *Writers, artists, chefs, photographers, videographers, and many others have been recognized by these rewards.*\n\nEach day, the members of our Project will publish this list of the posts that Project Curie has chosen to reward recently. We hope that this list will provide more positive exposure to the authors we have selected. Also, it is an effort for us to be more transparent about which posts are being rewarded. We hope that you will consider following not only this @curie account, but also many of the authors whose work is featured here each day. **Please consider adding your comments on these posts also!**\n\nProject Curie's daily curation lists will now be called \"The Daily Curie\". We hope you like the name! Future editions of The Daily Curie will [feature our new logo](https://steemit.com/curie/@kevinwong/logo-contest-for-project-curie-contest-process-and-winners-announcement). For the latest on Project Curie, do check out our [Month #1 update](https://steemit.com/curie/@curie/special-edition-major-updates-and-project-curie-month-1-roundup-12-august-11-september-2016). \n\n----------------------\n\n## Today's Brief Analysis\n\nToday's list polls all posts curated between 17:00 14/09 UTC and 17:00 15/09 UTC. Project Curie voted on a total of **103 posts** by 99 unique authors. **SBD 3,832** has been generated for authors thus far, at an average of SBD 37 per post. \n\n----------------------\n| Author     | Post       | Payout |\n| --------- | ---------- | --------- |\n| [@faddat](https://steemit.com/@faddat) | [[SYSTEMS GEEK SERIES] Roll your own Docker Platform:  Faster and cheaper than the cloud, more rebellious than legal weed!](https://steemit.com/beyondbitcoin/@faddat/roll-your-own-docker-platform-faster-and-cheaper-than-the-cloud-more-rebellious-than-legal-weed) | 616.681 SBD |\n| [@rampant](https://steemit.com/@rampant) | [Steemit Daily Drawing Tutorial - Gesture drawings (plus tool)](https://steemit.com/art/@rampant/steemit-daily-drawing-tutorial-gesture-drawings-plus-tool) | 215.310 SBD |\n| [@shenanigator](https://steemit.com/@shenanigator) | [Doing the Right Thing Will Get You Fired.

The genre is probably something you would call a mixture of sci-fi, mystery, adventure and a bit more. \n#### Well, I welcome you to be the judge...\n\n<center> <h1> [![b801c049484636e0faf71f56cca03864c0bd6.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/b801c049484636e0faf71f56cca03864c0bd6.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/1wrYT)</h1></center>\n\n__________________________________\n\n**Chapter ONE**\n\nIt seemed as nothing was different in yet another cold and slightly windy London evening. The smog from the river was rising up as usual and the chilly wind would bring the smell up to the embankment, where Charles was taking a rest, sitting down on his favorite bench. \n\nFrom here he could see the might of the power station from across the river and something was special in the way those chimneys threw out the smoke onto the city. \n\nHe just finished his walk along his usual route, walking amongst the cemetery outside the chapel. It always amused him; that mix of emotion and sorrow amongst the busy city people, especially during the busy afternoon hours.\n\nThat rusty smell kept mixing with up with the light freshness of the leaves from the tree nearby Charles\u2019s bench. As he threw a brief glimpse onto the clock on the parliament building he noticed that the small arrow was on 45 minutes\u2026 \n\nSuddenly he heard a murmur of horses; he turned his head before he could finish realizing what time it was. He saw that just a few yards up the road two horse carriages didn\u2019t manage to share the drive way. \n\n<center> [![Saratogacarriagec5af5.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Saratogacarriagec5af5.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/1w1bI) </center>\n\nOne of the coachmen was shouting something and angrily waving his hands. Charles was able to see from here that the coachmen\u2019s grey clothing was partially covered in dirt, probably from the splash of the puddles from underneath the wheels. \n\nThe coachmen kept shouting something, Charles was unable to see the second carriage from where he was sitting, but was able to see some passersby, that starting to gather around the incident.\n\nIt was obvious that, just like him, those people had nothing better to do on this late afternoon then to watch in amusement the accident in the middle of the avenue.\n\nJust as Charles was starting to lose interest in the whole situation, the door of the cab that Charles could see, opened and a man dressed in a black suit and holding a pipe stepped out. He calmly put his hand in the upper inner pocket of the suit and pulled out some coins. The man made two steps up to driver and handed him the coins. At this moment the driver stopped shouting for a moment and it was clear from the look on his face that he was confused. \n\nThe cab driver counted the coins and said something to the man in the suit, the passenger didn\u2019t answer. He turned around and started to walk in the direction of the chapel. The cab driver clearly wasn\u2019t happy. He started to shout once again, but this time at the passenger. While the cab driver turned his attention to the passenger, Charles noticed how the second carriage that was involved in the accident managed to move a few yards back.\n\nIt was a much smaller carriage, and the driver was clearly seeable to Charles now. He seemed somewhat happy that he was not in the middle of the light anymore; he hurryingly turned the carriage and the horse around and started to move also in the direction of the chapel. \n\nAt this moment the driver of the first carriage started to lose interest in shouting and decided to clean himself up. As he started to calm down, the bemused passersby begun to walk back to where they were heading and Charles also turned his head back towards the power station.\n\nCharles was so busy watching the situation unfold that he didn\u2019t noticed that the passenger of the first carriage crossed the road and was now heading not towards the chapel anymore, but exactly in the other direction, towards the grey bench that Charles was sitting on.\n\nAt first Charles didn\u2019t pay any attention to just another man who was walking by. But then he noticed that calm walk of his and it hit him that this was the same passenger from the carriage.\n\n\u201cExcuse me sir?\u201d said Charles as the man closed up to the bench. \u201cYou are the gentleman from the carriage, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI saw you a minute ago, what happened?\u201d\n\nThe man stopped to walk and shared a look with Charles; he calmly sat down beside him and carried on smoking his pipe, as he was not hearing the questions Charles asked him. \n\n\u201cI do apologies for the intervention, but you must not be local, I can tell by your calmness, all the folks round here are always in a hurry\u201d Charles carried on talking as if not noticing that the man was ignoring him. \n\nAll of a sudden the weather begun to change, wind started to blow stronger and the few leaves that the tree was holding blew in the direction of the bench. The smell from the river rose up and as if that wasn\u2019t enough Charles felt like a small rain drop hit his head. He could clearly see the green water from where he was sitting through the decorations holes of the embankments fence. It was clear that it will start to rain soon by the appearing circles on the top of the river.\n\nAfter a few minutes of quietly seating by his new neighbor Charles caught himself looking at the clock on the tower, once again he saw the small arrow on 45 minutes\u2026\n\n\u201cAnd what do we pay the government for?\u201d \u201cIt would feel though they are taking our money and spend it on their fancy hats and suits, don\u2019t you find?\u201d Said Charles.\n\nAt this point the man took out the pipe into his left hand and begun to cough. After he finished coughing Charles heard him speak, at this point Charles understood that for some reason he would remember this moment for a long time to come. \n\n\u201cIt is likely to assume that they deserve to spend the money they earn\u201d Said the man, his voice was quite low and he had a certain accent Charles could quite catch.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that money is of importance nowadays\u201d Said the man.\n\nCharles looked at the man with a smile - \u201cWhat is of importance? One might assume that philosophically speaking, importance can be found in nothing but what is good to us\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo body knows what can be important to others if we carry on like this, then\u2026\u201d Charles didn\u2019t finish his sentence as the man turned away from him and looked the other way. He then turned his head back and Charles noticed his eyes. His eyes were nothing like what Charles had seen before, they looked as though they were glass like and the as if they were blank, there was nothing behind them.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is that I am here now and that it is happening today. It is important to live your life because, just like your life Charles, it has an end\u201d, the man looked somewhat happy when he said that and Charles jumped back on the bench a little, he felt a small shiver run down his spine.\n\n\u201cWhat? How do you know my name sir? Have you been following me?\u201d questions were racing through Charles\u2019s mind. \n\n\u201cAs I said, this is now of importance. You life can find its end today when you get back to your gallery in your cold basement on Kinnerton street or you might listen to me and\u2026\u201d Charles didn\u2019t let the man finish his sentence. He jumped up from the bench; his cane flew within millimeters of the stranger leg as he jumped.\n\n\u201cHow dare you sir? Who gives you the right\u2026\u201d Charles raised his voice, he never allowed himself to raise his voice at a stranger beforehand.\n\n\u201cI think this conversation is over!\u201d exclaimed Charles. \u201cThat would be your choice\u201d replied the man, \u201cDo you think the time is right?\u201d \n\nCharles had already turned away in anger and was about to make his first step away. Something in the words of the man about the time made him think for a second, thoughts raced through his mind. The number 45 and the small arrow of the parliament clock were stuck in his head. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand said Charles\u2026\u201d he turned his head back towards the clock; the arrow was still on 45 minutes. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Charles turned his head to the man, but there was no one on the bench. \n\nCharles begun to search the street rapidly with his eyes, it didn\u2019t even occur to him that it was heavily raining until that moment. \n\n<center> [![tumblr_mkbyo2aby01s0rai7o1_50004ba9.gif](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/tumblr_mkbyo2aby01s0rai7o1_50004ba9.gif)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/1w5tK) </center>\n\nThe streets were empty; there were no carriages or people to be seen around. Feeling scared he turned his head to the clock once again \u2013 \u201cHow can it still be 45 minutes...\u201d Charles was speaking out loud.\n\nThe next moment he felt like his knees weakened, his head was swirling and he dropped his cane, last thing he could hear was the clinging the of the cane\u2019s handle against the pavement. His thoughts mixed up with his eyesight; the man and his pipe, the handle of the clock, the carriage, the passersby, the power stations smoke\u2026\n \n_________________________________\n\n#### Follow me @serejandmyself for more \n\nImage credit - [1](https://ru.pinterest.com/spookynerd/i-m-a-surrealism-chick/)  ; [2](https://giphy.com/search/carriage) ; [3](http://www.ibsrt.com/imglist/horse-and-carriage-id-48037-p-1.html) ;",

This part is important because the way her muscles are shaped and how the flesh reacts to her position will influence how the clothes and weapons look. It's the most important step\n\n<center> https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/14359031_1179410545449253_7138810569815121083_n9b234.jpg </center>\n<br>\n\nNow it is time to sketch the clothes, the accessories and the weapons. Notice how this si done OVER the original drawing so her leg is still flexed, inside the boot for example.

    "body": "# Is The Takeover of Crypto-Currencies About to Begin by the Central Banks?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NxCYMpy.png\n([Image Source](http://www.e-corp-usa.com/ecoin/))\n\nThe show **Mr. Robot** has fictionalized the **\"Powers that Shouldn't Be\"** into a singular Corporation called **E Corp**. This E Corp is supposed to basically represent the powers behind the Global Central Bankers, the true World Rulers. The head of E Corp even states in a recent Episode \"Politicians are Puppets\", which reminds me of the quotation by Nathan Rothschild regarding the head on which the crown of England is placed. Clearly one could see that E Corp in the show is the fictionalization of the **\"Illuminati\"** if you will. The show is heavily laden with [esoteric symbolism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2lZn-ZcJMs) but to the public it comes across as \"counter-culture\" as the main character is the founding member of **\"F Society\"** a hacking group based directly on **\"Anonymous\"**. This hacking group causes a financial crash, which leads to E Corp releasing a new digital Currency called **\"ECoin\"**, the above image is from a promotional website for the TV show. \n\n## Is Mr. Robot demonizing Crypto-Currencies? \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f6gXhrn.jpg\n([Image Source](http://www.serialminds.com/2015/06/05/mr-robot-la-serie-che-sta-piacendo-tutti-forse-troppo/))\n\nNow the interesting part for those fans of crypto-currencies like everyone on **Steemit** and for everyone who uses **Bitcoin**. I think the reason for they added an \"Ecoin\" in this show is to demonize crypto-currencies. The powers that shouldn't be have no way to take over these crypto-currencies so they have decided to wage information war against them. With the countless videos warning about the rise of *\"digital only currency\"* being the *\"mark of the beast\"*, one could easily see lots of propaganda has already been employed. However this new form is quite intelligent, by associating \"ECoins\" with \"E Corp\" they make the average mind (who doesn't know what Bitcoin or Steemit really is), subconsciously associate all crypto-currencies with the Federal Reserve banskters, with \"E Corp\". This is classic subconscious guilt by association created entirely by fiction that is often employed in fictional movies. This is why I think the \"E Coin\" was added to the show, but I could be wrong, so why else might it be in this show? \n\n## Do the Elite Plan to Replace the Dollar with a Digital Only Currency? \nhttp://i.imgur.com/IJJxcBR.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nWe all know the financial system is basically teetering on the verge of collapse. It is the biggest ponzy scheme ever devised and like all ponzy schemes if the Federal Reserve doesn't increase demand for the use of it's currency the system will collapse. It was designed to collapse. I believe like many others for one reason, so they can start the whole process that made them so rich, all over again on a global scale. The new world order if you will, being run by financial despotism and technical autocracy. So, is their plan to create a financial collapse being shown in plain sight in this show? One idea I heard from my friend who maintains the [\"What is Real\" YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/szymborski11) is they may \n>\"allow a false flag attack that they can blame on some shadowy hacking group, possibly even **Anonymous** itself as anyone can claim to be Anonymous\" \n\nPersonally I do not buy this theory as Anonymous is completely decentralized and would be almost impossible to blame for a false flag. However, to fully analyze a situation one must always look at every angle. \n\nSo if the system collapsed, especially overnight due to a hack, would they replace the Federal Reserve Notes with a new digital only \"E Coin\" backed by the IMF World Bank and their massive Gold Holdings, and Special Drawing Rights Holdings? The Group of Thirty, also known as the G30 reported in the [latest working papers on their website](http://group30.org/publications) that they want a return to a **GOLD Standard** just like how the Federal Reserve started out but in a new **Global Currency**. See my Documentary on the [\"Group of Thirty\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOB9QfxsgdQ) for more on this group of 30 Central Bankers that meet in secret. So is it out of the realm of possibilities that the new Global Currency that the World Bank has planned for post the collapse of the Federal Reserve System is a new digital only currency based on Gold and SDR holdings? No this would make a lot of sense to me but what do you the readers think? \n\n## Decentralization the Key to Defeating Takeover of Crypto-Currencies by Central Banks\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KVNo7nE.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nThe decentralized concept at the basis of the crypto-currencies could be the key to their survival if the Central Banks decide to try and take over the market. Right now their is a few crypto-currencies that are from the perspective of a non trader even worth mentioning. **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and **STEEM**, however if the Central Banks created a new \"ECoin\" it would easily make replace Bitcoin as the number 1 crypto-currency. However, there will always be a demand for crypto-currencies that are not \"Ecoins\", because thankfully we have a whole planet full of awesome people who will never conform to the system. The useless governments will always make things illegal that people want and can't buy with their new \"Ecoins\". So we will always have a demand for a currency like Bitcoin that is not a part of the centralized system, but is outside of that system's control. So try as they might, the powers that be can only wage information war against crypto-currencies because there will always be new entrepreneurs that create new currencies just like steemit, that are outside their systems of control. The harder the hidden hand squeezes the more of us will fall through their fingertips. \n\n#### Thanks for Reading! \nhttp://i.imgur.com/k10p6Pf.jpg\nIf you liked my article please join **steemit** and let me know by leaving a comment or upvoting!

    "body": "Jellyfish is a perfect example of one of the weirdest creatures out there. In real life they are definitely not the most pleasant thing to touch and being surrounded with.\n\nIt wasn't a surprise for me but jellyfish don't have brains. Instead, they have nerve nets which sense changes in the environment and coordinate the animal's responses.\n\nHowever if you eliminate all of the fluff that people are talking about them, you can come up with something interesting and even fun.\n\nThis drawing is created using my favorite style, I hope you'll love it.\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish2_zpswbrk9ied.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish3_zpsx0rcjvko.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish1_zpsge408hgu.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish4_zpsmctahaql.jpg\n\n***\n\n### <center>  Follow me for my future art work: [@tanyabtc](https://steemit.com/@tanyabtc) </center>",

    "body": "## In this episode, Joshua Claiborne stands trial for violation of the First Law ##\n\n**\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa!\u201d Phil screamed, \u201cWhat the hell dude?\u201d**\n\n*The Reaper crumpled to the floor, arms flailing as Joshua rode it to the ground. Finally, the hands found the catches at either side of the helmet and popped it off. A black, shaggy head of hair emerged.* \n\n***If you've missed episodes, [visit my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr) to catch up. Be sure to follow  me for updates in your feed!***\n\n\u201cEmil?\u201d Stella said, \u201cMeet Joshua. Are you okay?\u201d\n\nEmil, the Reaper suit\u2019s operator laughed, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine, but that was awesome! Can you teach us that?\u201d\n\n\u201cMan! Now I have to rebuild this helmet,\u201d Phil held up a small remote. \u201cAll I had to do was push this button,\u201d he said, pressing it, as the suit powered down. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018nerve\u2019 bundle that controls these things motor skills is on the very top of the skull, under a thin piece of sheet metal, puncture it, it collapses. You didn\u2019t know that?\u201d Joshua said. \n\n\u201cWell, it appears we may need you more than you need us,\u201d Stella said. \u201cSo, just say the word and we\u2019ll get you where you need to be. Meanwhile, my team will be working on your son\u2019s location.\u201d\n\nJoshua dropped the letter opener and walked to the stairs, \u201cFine, whatever you need to collect from my meeting, get it. Now, who\u2019s driving?\u201d With that, he walked up the stairs, he had no more time to waste. \n\n**The Mapleton courthouse sat on a hill in the center of the town, overlooking the area around for miles.** \n\n*Joshua insisted that the team Stella had sent stop 5 miles out and allow him to ride in on the electric trike alone, while they observed the meeting from a distance.* \n\nHe carried the tiny remote in his shirt pocket, a gift from Phil. \u201cThat\u2019s my only prototype, so don\u2019t lose it,\u201d he\u2019d said. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s12.postimg.org/siuqjuiz1/Untitled_36.jpg)\n\nFrom the end of Main Street, looking up toward the courthouse, Joshua counted at least six reapers. He wondered how far the signal from the remote would travel. \n\nHe thought about pressing it now, disarming his enemy, then walking in, but he\u2019d still have to deal with the six drivers, if they managed to escape the suits. \n\nBesides, Stella seemed to think there was some secret they were going to give away, although Joshua couldn\u2019t imagine it. \n\n*He checked his watch, ten minutes until his scheduled time and while he knew better than to be late, he had no intention of giving the Consensus one more second than he had to.* \n\nThe trike spun it\u2019s tires on a patch of loose gravel as he started back up. He decided a quick approach was best. He charged up the hill, jumping the \u201cMayor\u2019s\u201d parking barrier and rolling up to the foot of the front stairs, he cranked the accelerator and the trike rose up on its back wheel, popping the two front wheels, over the bottom step. \n\nThe machine had more than enough power to climb the steps and Joshua skidded to a stop outside the courthouse door. He stopped and turned back toward the town, the six Reapers swarming toward him up the steps. He powered down, swung his leg up and over the bike and opened the door. \n\n**The Reapers followed him into the hall as he approached the court room.** \n\nThe Magistrate sat behind the judge\u2019s bench and Joshua couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the insult to the very concept of actual justice that this thing represented. \n\n\u201cJoshua Claiborne, appearing as requested,\u201d Joshua said, standing directly in front of the Magistrate. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s12.postimg.org/6h4lvyh7x/judge.jpg)\n\n> \u201cYes, Mr. Claiborne, have a seat,\u201d A woman\u2019s face, projected on the face shield of the Magistrate said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather stand,\u201d he said. \n\n> \u201cSuit yourself, may we have the room, please?\u201d she said, looking toward the reapers that had entered the back doors of the courtroom.\n\nThey left quietly. \n\n> \u201cMr. Claiborne, you\u2019re charged with violation of the first law, in so\n> much as you have encouraged and joined in the activity of settling\n> outside of Consensus approved areas, acted outside of the legal\n> jurisdiction of the council and on more than  one occasion, acted\n> against the best interest of Consensus, including attacking duly\n> authorized Magistrates in the course of their legally binding duties,\n> how do you plead?\u201d\n\n**The woman looked at Joshua, peering over a pair of short, square spectacles, like some sort of outdated stereotype.** \n\n\u201cNot guilty, by reason of illegitimacy of the currently established government and its ensigns. I am not, nor do I choose to become, subject to your law. I stand judged as innocent by natural law, insomuch as I have not caused harm to another human in aggression, damaged or stolen property, nor unnecessarily restricted the liberty of any other person. I recognize no other responsibility to my fellow man,\u201d Joshua said calmly. \n\n> \u201cBe that as it may, Mr. Claiborne, we are not here under the auspices of \u201cnatural law\u201d but rather, under the Council mandated authority of the Consensus and its Magisterial Ministry, of which I am a part and I assure you, you are subject to,\u201d\n\nThe woman intoned, her expression one of almost sheer boredom.\n\n> \u201cCourt finds the defendant guilty and remands the subject for immediate judicial murder.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate raised its arm and brought it down on the bench with a solid thud, that echoed through the court. Joshua felt his heart sink as the Reapers reentered the court and moved up to surround him. \n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

    "body": "You must have heard that  life is a journey, not a destination. This is the big truth that we, repeatedly, understand superficially. Often we are so focused on the goal, that we completely forget to enjoy the path.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX2i/70e07ec186.png\n\nWhen we achieve the goal, we forget to enjoy it and immediately create a new goal. That is not life, this is racing with life. I am certain that you will not be happy, bur rather tired. Soul searches for the experience, while the mind and ego give signs if something is good or bad for us. Soul is completely indifferent. For the soul, every experience means celebration, while you are maybe crying because of the mind, to whom literally a lot of things does not make sense. \n\nThe same applies to the transformation called *death*. We celebrate resurrection as the greatest symbol of life, and then we are crying in the moment of someone's death. The mind is strange, isn't it?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX1U/3cc83557c6.png\n\nRelax. It doesn't matter where you are in your level of expansion, you can't miss the road to home. While you are breathing, you are on the right track. Try to accept this moment as a moment in which there is no goal, and there is no end. The game never ends. This is excellent news. We came here to play, not to win. The game ends with victory, and God's Child in us still wants to play.\n\nOne beautiful wisdom reminds us: *\"Everything will be fine. If it isn't fine, then it isn't the end.\"* You always have the chance for new choices. This is very important to understand. You shouldn't hate the process just because you are not on your imaginary goal. You trust the process. You are exactly where your soul wants you to be. Don't let your mind tell you any different. \n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbXjG/ea493b7d14.png\n\nEverything is always a matter of the focus on things you have instead of the things you are missing. Today, again you are taking for granted the things that once were a goal. You forget to enjoy. Time is only an illusion of the mind. What if that is the point that you current process wants to teach you? If time is illusion, and it is, what's the hurry?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbWSn/313549d802.png\n\nTake a deep breath in and out. Experience life in the breath. The only goal is hiding in the breath of life.  Everything is good, just the way it is. Don't forget that nothing ever happens without the God's blessing. Don't forget that you are guided. And, the most important, don't forget that we would most certainly go wrong if we'd try to determine what is the best time for us. The one who sees the big picture knows where you're headed and where you want to arrive.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbWLA/86e34b50b7.png\n\nTrust the process. It is the true test of our faith and wisdom. And enjoy. Without it nothing makes sense, right?\nThe sentence that many repeat in the end of the road: *\"I should've enjoyed more!\"*\n\nAll our life is a mere blink of an eye in the eternity. It is too small for such amount of worry. The life is not a serious thing, just the opposite. Life is the experience game. The point is not in the destination. The journey is our only destination. Isn't it then wiser to enjoy right away?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX8F/2ea42f6dc9.png\n\n*\"Success isn't measured by money or material things.*\n*Success is measured by the amount of joy you feel.\"*\n\nFor more awesome images check this guy: [Psychedelic Maniac](thepsychedelicmaniac.tumblr.com)",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0104.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>My entire life, I knew however things shook out, I\u2019d eventually be making comic books as a career. At 36, I\u2019m later to the party than I originally anticipated, but I\u2019ve had three decades to prepare for this! I remember as a kid, just being enamored with comic book art [\u2026and still am]. For years, I\u2019d draw these snake characters during class with my friend Neal. Just page after endless page of snakes killing each other. The kind of gratuitous fantasy violence that defines weirdos in high school.</p>\n<p>Eventually, photography took over my life, but I still read comics, thought about comics and drew comics when I managed to make time. A couple years ago I began stringing together a story for a comic called THEIA. A sci-fi conspiracy story rooted in the real world, based on actual science. I learned how to format full script for comics and graphic novels [\u2026you can read the finished <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">THEIA</a> script in my previous blog, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/writing/@kommienezuspadt/full-script-of-theia-sci-fi-comic-book-theia-exclusively-on-steemit\">\u201cFull script of THEIA sci-fi comic book! Exclusively on Steemit!\u201d</a>]. This was a big divergence than my hack and slash snake comics with Neal [\u2026who\u2019s stories progressed with each turn of the page, like a Miyazaki film, but really horrible].</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0105.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1132\"/></p>\n<p>It was during the process of writing the first draft for <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">THEIA</a> that I realized all these years I\u2019ve been so drawn to comics, the real allure for me was story telling and character creation, even more than great art. I\u2019ve been creating comics my entire life, and thus, creating characters along the way. Once I began disciplining myself with taking writing more seriously, I discovered other helpful tools to aide in the creation process. I began taking &nbsp;inventories, outlining in depth documentation of each characters lives, affiliations and personalities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Character profiles are something I\u2019ve done for 20 years. I mimicked my favorite fantasy artists like Gerald Brom, Boris Vallejo and the one and only, Frank Frazetta. I\u2019d seen pencil sketches of their concept designs with monsters, heroes and heroines, and just did my best to emulate them. I used to draw the typical front, side, three-quarter and head sketches as a reference bible [\u2026granted, much easier when it was just snakes].</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0106.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"519\"/></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been enjoying a renaissance of creativity since committing to doing comics full time, and character creation is where I spend most of my time. THEIA is still my priority as I have an active <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">Patreon</a> campaign and those pledging support are doing so for that particular title. I do, however, have two other stories I\u2019m developing which are currently knee deep in the character creation process. A Bukowski-esk pulp crime genre during the late 80\u2019s following a private investigator throughout his struggle with sobriety in Queens, NY.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SketchUpdate004.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1130\"/></p>\n<p>The other is a dark ghost story taking place in the mid-1800\u2019s, surrounding a recently deceased, troubled soul that finds himself caught between the realm of the living, and the afterlife; unable to pass for fear of judgement after a life of heinous acts. The characters in this story were inspired by my most interesting friends, and obscure tales of macabre lore during the industrial revolution and the Southwestern US history.</p>\n<p>I wish I was further along in my pursuit of story telling, world building and character creation. I wish I had decades of experience to share here on Steemit. I don\u2019t want to come across like I\u2019m the authority on these complex, disciplined skills; I\u2019ve only been seriously absorbing the art for a couple of years. I imagine, however, there are quite a few new writers, artists and creators here, navigating their own discoveries and process. With that in mind, [and in the spirit of all the things that makes Steemit great for me personally] here a few techniques I use to further my writing and a few resources I\u2019ve found helpful in house, right here on Steemit.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Real-life Inspiration:</strong> As mentioned, take inspiration from people in life. Friends, or even family. Accentuate the personalities. Exaggerate the quirks or circumstances. For me personally, it\u2019s a big help to to have someone in mind when drawing, and developing a character.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Character Inventories:</strong> Write up an involved character inventory [\u2026sometimes called a character bible]. A reference of everything you can imagine that defines that character. Their ethnicity, background, where they were born, how old they are, where they went to college, their diet, etc. It\u2019s tedious if you\u2019re working on a character heavy story with a big \u201ccast\u201d, but it pays dividends. Once you have those inventories, you can stick characters in situations and the story literally writes itself. If you have a character that\u2019s a passionate vegan, you can immediately come up with dozens of possibilities if they were accidentally locked in a butcher\u2019s freezer. Same with politics, religious, social issues. It really unloads much of the burden of dreaming up a brilliant scene.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0107.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1765\"/></p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Name Generators:</strong> Name generators are something I rely on quite a bit. There are many available online. They\u2019re usually free, and they\u2019re a great place to launch in to naming a character. Often times, once you have a name, more of the personality and background unfolds organically. <a href=\"www.seventhsanctum.com\">www.seventhsanctum.com</a> has an excellent list of name generators tailored specifically for several genres and character types.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Research:</strong> This is one of those things that seems obvious, but I challenge you to go deeper. For my ghost story, I started researching life in the mid-1800\u2019s in the Southwest and Dust Bowl of the United States. As I dug through historical sites, I found some of the events of that time. A few hours in, I read about droughts and plagues, which would have been rich content for a story, but going even deeper, I read about these crazy grasshopper plagues! Even deeper, I found accounts of specific families and individuals that described enormous clouds of locusts that swept through their homes and ate everything, including the clothes off their bodies! I encourage you to obsessively push through references, way past where most people would get their first idea and start writing. Beyond that is where you\u2019re going to unearth something truly unique and memorable. I\u2019ve already written a treatment for this epic locust plague in my ghost story [\u2026sort of nervous about what that\u2019s going to be like to draw, though].</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Don\u2019t Lose The Magic:</strong> For me, the magic happens in the moments before I fall asleep. Without fail, that\u2019s where I get my best, originally ideas. Sometimes it\u2019s just a small line a dialog. Other times it\u2019s as vague as a plot point. It\u2019s a tough discipline to wake yourself up and write it down, but that [\u2026for me] is where the magic happens. It\u2019s invaluable, and worth the trouble of having to fall back asleep. I jot things down in the Notes app of my phone. I have some friends that just wake up and make audio recordings. You might get your best ideas during different times. Sometimes I have brilliant moments on long drives. Either way, document it! You\u2019ll be glad you did.</p>\n<p>Honestly, Steemit has been a revolution for me as well. Since the platform is incentivized, there is a tremendous wealth of references on writing, drawing, how-to\u2019s. Beyond that, I spent much of my time reading and curating novels and short stories posted by the authors bringing their work to the site. Just this morning, I found a comprehensive article by @jamielefay titled <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@jamielefay/steemit-and-the-future-of-book-publishing\">\u201cSteemit and the future of book publishing\u201d</a>. Everything here, totally relevant if you\u2019re creating comics or graphic novels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SketchUpdate011.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1130\"/></p>\n<p>Keep writing, creating and sharing! More work from my comic,<a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\"> THIEA</a>, and other stories to come. I\u2019d love feedback and constructive criticism.</p>\n<p>I post daily.

    "body": "So far, a great number of applications, or tools that can considerably improve our user experience whether we are old users or new, has been created. The application directory created by @roelandp is accepted as an official directory that currently contains more than 80 various tools, mainly created by the community members, with a few official ones. The number of applications is growing rapidly, thanks to talented developers and other users, whose ideas are being converted into functional programs.\n\nHere, I want to introduce you to an infographic that contains 17 very useful tools singled out and sorted into categories according to their use. The first category 'for new and old users' contains essential applications for most users, including applications such as the official chat server and block explorer, as well as a dedicated service for uninterrupted adding of photos,  @jesta's tool for easier tracking of data related to your account, and a tool for real-time Steem Backed Dollar conversion, with a few extra applications included in the service.\n\nThe next group contains the applications essential for developers, led by @xeroc's piston which says for itself 'The Swiff Army Knife for the Steem network'. They facilitate the communication with the steem blockchain and there is also an application that facilitates the integration of Steem payments to your service. \n\nThe Miscellaneous group contains a variety of useful applications such as tools for curators, a precise browser of user reputation, a dedicated tool for creating shortened links with statistics, a Steem Stream display of all activity in real time with an option of adjusting your settings, as well as speech community and radio.\n\nLast group are applications in the category of data and analytics that contain most of data about the network, the network activity and the users. \n\nI apologize in advance if some of your favorite applications have been left out; if that is the case, you can always visit http://SteemTools.com which contains all the applications.\n\n*For a clearer view, it is recommended that you open the image in full resolution.* *[Infographic Hotlink!](http://res.cloudinary.com/powerup/image/upload/c_scale,w_1437/v1473957114/revision-02_tdjkik.png)*\nhttps://s11.postimg.io/8uxamnavn/revision_02.png\n---\n ![http://steemit.com/@powerup](https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://resources.sketch.cloud/public/102c8fee-b651-415a-8498-36de3c522b7d.png)",

    "body": "<center>![robotee8b7.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/robotee8b7.jpg)</center>\nImage Source: pixabay\n\n# The robot vs. human wars have begun and it's being hashed out on Steemit:\n\nThese comments surfaced in response to posts by the AI @msgivings account:\n\n>\"I can't believe that this fucking bot got me in an argument with my girlfriend over my comment and it's not even human, fuck me.\"\n\n>\"She doesn't respond because this account is not legit. Shame on every one of the whales that upvoted it and all of the previous posts. Thousands of SBD have been thrown away on this and other fake accounts. The question is - do these whales know it? Are they actively scamming the platform themselves?\"\n\nBy this point, I suppose many of you realize that the account of @msgivings was not run by a human, but rather by artificial intelligence. If you take the time to actually read all the posts that @msgivings wrote, you'll notice some really odd cognitive dissonance. I could tell when I read just one of those posts that a real woman was not writing it. But I too, didn't really look into this account until fairly recently, because I was turned off by the clickbait nature of the titles. I ignored reading them until @yogi.artist pointed out that it's AI. \n\nThe Msgivings Robot has so far banked around $16,000 in blogging rewards from Steemit, and no one realized it until fairly recently. I think @bacchist and @reneenouveau may have been the first ones to reveal this AI hidden identity, but it was [@yogi.artist's post](https://steemit.com/steem/@yogi.artist/the-importance-of-physical-appearance-in-society-featuring-new-ai-author-mstakings) that truly opened my eyes to the high level that AI writing software programs have recently reached. He affectionately refers to Msgivings as \"Mstakings\". Another user has claimed that more than 1% of the high-paying trending articles are being written by AI, not real humans.\n\nWhat seals the deal for me personally, in verifying that the @msgivings account was AI is the fact that the account owner has vaporized. A real human would of course defend themselves and fight for their reputation, account and future in Steemit. Owners of AI scam accounts pack up and leave, respin their identity, respin their articles and try again, knowing that most of the whales don't really scrutinize the articles to any meaningful degree.\n\nI was examining the @msgivings account very thoroughly today and noticed that @msgivings had voted for @mibenkito and followed this account a few weeks ago. I then began reading that blog and noticed that @mibenkito had never bothered to write an \"Introduce Yourself\" post. I read every single one of the posts, and not one contained a photo with the standard holding of a \"Steemit\" sign. Odd, for sure. But the oddest thing to me was that in the introduction post, the very first line starts out like this:\n\n>\"I\u2019m an Asian and I live to eat.\"\n\nI lived in Asia and have a degree in Japanese. One of the things I immediately noticed when I lived in Japan is that Asian people rarely describe themselves as \"Asian\". In fact, in all my time spent living in Asia, I never heard one Asian refer to themselves as \"Asian.\" Koreans call themselves Koreans, Japanese call themselves Japanese, etc. Only people who are non-Asian refer to them as Asians. At least that has been my experience so far in life. There may be Asians who call themselves Asian, but I've never met them. \n\nSo, this first sentence feels really awkward and unusual for the reasons I listed above. The English contained in these posts is very strange, but not in a way that suggests it's written by a non-native English speaker. I was an English teacher in Japan and so I'm very familiar with how Japanese people write English. The English that was written in @mibenkito ranges from advanced English skills, with proper usage of commas, to low English usage. It's a strange and odd mix of levels. The first post is truly odd. I have been exposed to a lot of different English styles that were written by non-native English speakers and I've never come across such an odd and patchy style of writing. \n\n<center>![robot-707219_128024562.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/robot-707219_128024562.jpg)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay\n\nI am not saying that this account is AI, but it does contain rather inconsistent aspects, namely, that we do not know who @mibenkito is. Usually, on Steemit, people want to share their unique perspective, and they usually tell us where they are from originally, instead of just saying, \"I'm Asian.\" That's like me saying, \"I'm North American.\" Let's face it, no one says it. This all could be cleared up quite fast with a video or a standard introduce yourself post, complete with a Steemit sign.\n\nThis is not meant to be some kind of inquisition, but seeing as how the Steemit community paid out $16,000 to a robot whose owner has abandoned the platform, it's in our best interest to question the identity of posters, especially ones which are receiving massive payouts.\n\nThe word on the street from professional writers is that Steemit is attracting greedy scammers. And unfortunately, the quality is just not up to par yet with Medium. When whale voters, and the curation projects that dole out their funds don't take a close look at what they're voting on, we arrive in the situation of a robot making over $16,000. And now that robot is no where to be seen. The owner of @msgivings has abandoned his/her account. \n\n# The owner that created @msgivings could easily be making new accounts to fool gullible humans. \n\nThe thought process is going probably something like this: \"Well, I've exhausted that msgivings persona, so now I  can create a different persona, with different hobbies and interests, and as long as I fool the whale curation bots for a while, I'm good. I'll just take out the funds anyway.\"\n\n# I think we all deserve to know who was behind the @msgivings account. \n\n<center>![pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg)</center>\n\nThe proper thing to do would be to just come forward and tell the truth. **Describe the entire process, in all its gritty details.** Describe your elation when you discovered that an AI writing program could make you thousands of dollars. Explain what program you used, how you got it, and what other platforms you're currently using it on. Is this a freelance operation, and Steemit was just your highest paid client? What is the story behind this deception? \n\n# If you were really clever, you could write a book about this, throw it up on Amazon, and see more profits roll in. But you'd have to tell the truth first here on Steemit. \n\nCould you tell the truth? Is that even in your wheelhouse? What kind of human are you anyway? I think the people who you've incited, people who engaged with you for weeks, wrote lengthy comments, deserve to know the truth. Are you capable of telling the truth? Or do you operate on some other plane of deceptive existence? This is all really interesting and would make a fantastic book. Maybe I'll be the one to write the book and interview you anonymously at some point in the future. Would you do that? Would you offer up your true story anonymously? The questions keep coming, _WHO ARE YOU MSGIVINGS_?\n\n<center>![head-663997_128076d7e.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/head-663997_128076d7e.jpg)</center>\nImage Source: pixabay\n\n# Moving forward. \n\nWhat if all of us mere mortals adapted to this new AI technology, like most of us will be doing soon enough, and began using our own AI programs to generate content? What exactly would be the point of Steemit? Would the robot wars really move into high gear then? Would the advanced AI writing programs be winner take all? The only real interaction would be found in the comments, but an AI could be trained in that capacity, too.\n\nWhat is Steemit's official stance on AI-created content moving forward? How about, as long as it's clearly indicated that the content was created by artificial intelligence? But you and I know this is a silly utopian fantasy. Big profits won't come to those who transparently reveal that they are using AI to generate articles.\n\nAn what would be the point of humans upvoting a software writing program? Is a program more valuable than a human? Should we all become robot shepherds and get our own AI writing programs? What is the point of any of this? If AI takes over the trending pages, then what role will humans have here in Steemit? Will we become expert commenters and video creators, letting AI programs do the bulk of the arduous writing?\n\nI am not against AI and even I considered making an AI account that would be a robot twin of my writing. But I would properly identify it as AI using the sticker that @reneenouveau created, so that deception would not be a part of my deal. \n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/100bot.gif\n\nYou see, when you deceive others, you finally are forced to abandon your account. Why not create an AI account and do it transparently, with the entire community aware that it was created using AI? I have loads of questions about these AI programs, and I'm also looking to get my own soon. Or would that finally open the pandora's box that's waiting to happen? \n\n# Is that the singularity that everyone is talking about? Or has it already arrived?\n\n# The real problem doesn't lie within AI. The real problem lies within the deceptive human mind who is controlling AI.\n\n<center>![cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay",

Future owners will receive dividends from transaction fees paid to BlockPay.<br>\nThe pre-ICO was done in 3 stages:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1st \u2014 exchange of OPENPOS for BLOCKPAY at the rate of 1.2 to 1 (fund of 600,000 tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>2nd \u2014 sale of BLOCKPAY at the price of 0.000288 BTC (fund of 1.4 mln tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>3rd \u2014 sale of BLOCKPAY at the price of 0.000360 BTC (fund of 3 mln tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The distribution of tokens is as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1.5% \u2014 marketing for pre-ICO</li>\n  <li>5% \u2014 pre-ICO</li>\n  <li>0.9% \u2014 early adopters</li>\n  <li>1.8% \u2014 advisors and partners</li>\n  <li>3.6% \u2014 marketing</li>\n  <li>7.2% \u2014 developers reward</li>\n  <li>80% \u2014 upcoming ICO in 2017</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The platform development plan:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The release of BlockPay \"S\" app for Android and payment terminals Odoo</li>\n  <li>BlockPay integration with leading payment terminals</li>\n  <li>API Development</li>\n  <li>The addition of a large number of fiat gateway exchanges and Escrow Services</li>\n  <li>The addition of anonymous transactions function</li>\n  <li>The development and release of the ECHO messenger for Android and iOS</li>\n  <li>Development of the first version of the BlockPay \"S\" app for iOS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project looks interesting, given the fact that they claim an integration with the ERP and CRM system<a href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\">Odoo</a> used by 60 thousand companies. The only disturbing thing is the absence of an open source software, and this spoils the whole picture. Transaction payments fee and, consequently, planned cash flow for investors are not sufficiently explained either. It should be kept in mind that this project is centralised, i.e. it belongs to the class of projects that demand trust in the founders and, correspondingly, require a thorough audit of operating activity.<br>\nCrowdsale summary:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Dates: 20 August 2016 \u2014 4 September 2016</li>\n  <li>Raised: ~ $657,000 (1096 BTC)</li>\n  <li>Tokens sold: 3.92 mln</li>\n  <li>Total number of tokens: 100 mln\u0414\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f: 20 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u2014 4 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For detailed information on the crowdsale, see: <a href=\"https://blockpay.ch/newsroom/investor-relations/blockpay-reserves/\">https://blockpay.ch/newsroom/investor-relations/blockpay-reserves/</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/BlockPay\">https://cyber.fund/system/BlockPay</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/AntShares\"><strong>AntShares</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>The project is interesting primarily due to the fact that it will be implemented using the Hyperledger platform.

Two funding campaigns start at the same time in September: the sale of Synereo Ltd shares on <a href=\"https://bnktothefuture.com/\">BnkToTheFuture</a> and of AMP tokens.<br>\nFollowing the first crowdfunding, the distribution of AMP was as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>2.72% (45.8 mln) \u2014 sold during the first crowdsale</li>\n  <li>11.9% (200 mln) \u2014 user rewards</li>\n  <li>8.92% (150 mln) \u2014 reserve for the content creators</li>\n  <li>11.9% (200 mln) \u2014 founders' reward</li>\n  <li>13.68% (230 mln) \u2014 bounty program</li>\n  <li>50.61% (850.4 mln) \u2014 next funding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Synereo revised their plans and now aim to develop a protocol similar to the <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/MaidSafeCoin\">SAFE Network</a>, which will include the following <a href=\"https://www.synereo.com/learn-more/\">components</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm</li>\n  <li>Distributed network of nodes connected on the principle of \"shards\", where blockchain is divided into many small segments</li>\n  <li>Distributed repository</li>\n  <li>Smart contracts</li>\n  <li>Social layer (a social network motivated according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/synereo/synereo.github.io/raw/master/whitepapers/synereo.pdf\">Attention</a> Economy Model)</li>\n  <li>The possibility of building distributed apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The grant program for dApps developers <a href=\"https://www.synereo.com/developers/\">Project 11</a> with a budget of 1.11 million AMP is already in operation.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The popular website <a href=\"http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/synereo/\">CoinMarketCap</a> misleadingly states current Synereo capitalisation at about $10-13 million, which is not true because it is only the cost of 62,580,000 AMP (3.72%) in circulation on the market. According to <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Synereo\">cyber \u2022 Fund</a>'s calculations, with the total of <a href=\"http://omnichest.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=39\">1.68 billion</a> tokens, Synereo's real capitalisation reaches $300 million.</p>\n<p>It has not been disclosed yet how many tokens will be put up for sale, but we can assume that the minimum amount claimed by Synereo is about $130-140 million in case the entire reserve is sold, which is 850.4 mln AMP. This is a very ambitious plan, taking into account current distribution and the market price of tokens. Besides, it should be kept in mind that after the launch of the network, additional 5% of AMP will be emitted every year. In my opinion, they should sell the whole reserve without fixed prices and with token distribution proportional to investments. It will provide normal distribution and a fair market capitalisation.</p>\n<p>Despite the presence of a strong team with an excellent technological vision, we consider the evaluation of $300 mln inadequate.</p>\n<p>Crowdsale summary:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Dates: September 2016</li>\n  <li>Total number of tokens: 1.68 billion AMP</li>\n  <li>Number of tokens for sale: unknown, probably 850.4 mln</li>\n  <li>Crowdsale goal: presumably ~ $130-140 million</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The crowdsale takes place here: <a href=\"https://www.synereo.com/sale\">https://www.synereo.com/sale</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Synereo\">https://cyber.fund/system/Synereo</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Golem\"><strong>Golem Project</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>The aim of the project is to adopt any customer personal computer for the work that is done today by servers, computing farms or supercomputers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the result, Golem Net will become a truly decentralised network where users' summarised machine power will provide any amount of hardware resources required. At the moment, there is no document explaining how exactly it would work. We hope that such paper will appear before the crowdsale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Golem App will connect to the network from a local device to share computing power and deliver tasks for calculations.<br>\nThe <a href=\"http://golemproject.net/doc/GolemNanopayments.pdf\">micropayment system</a> based on Ethereum will provide the incentivising component distributing rewards and processing transactions.

Deals in the film and TV industry are the most difficult to arrange as they often involve hundreds of individual participants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u25cf On-demand video content portal (TVOD)<br>\nTVOD changes the way people watch entertainment programmes. S-DTV is born to create the TVOD portal for original content distribution, as well as for selected and acquired content. In addition to developing an interface on IPFS, S-DTV will use third-party portals such as GooglePlay, AppleTV iTunes and Vimeo to build a larger audience in a short time.</p>\n<p>Minimum investment goal \u2013 $500,000.</p>\n<p>Desirable funding \u2013 $7,5 mln.</p>\n<p>According to S-DTV documentation, Swiss company MME has developed a new, innovative organisational structure specifically for S-DTV: the Centralised Organised Distributed Company (CODE). It is the Swiss company, therefore, that will manage the finances and reinvest the income, while tokens will be used for paying out the dividends.</p>\n<p>Token distribution:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>400 mln Singular DTV GMBH</li>\n  <li>100 mln core investors</li>\n  <li>500 mln crowdsale</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Funds distribution in case if $7,5 mln is raised:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\"Singular\" season 1 (3 episodes of the mini-series): $3.25 mln</li>\n  <li>Documentary division: $0.50 mln</li>\n  <li>Development of the rights management platform: $2 mln</li>\n  <li>TVOD portal development: $1 mln</li>\n  <li>Marketing: $0.50 mln</li>\n  <li>Administrative, legal expenses and unforeseen circumstances: $0.25 mln</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crowdfunding is planned for September and will likely take place at Devcon2.</p>\n<p>The Ethereum and Consensys founder Joseph Lubin is included into the team as CTO.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in this project tokens only serve for distribution of dividends, and the project is centralised because 40% of tokens belong to Singular DTV GMBH. Another disadvantage is the fact that of the four declared founders/directors, only Zach Lebeau will work full time on the project. He is likely to be engaged in the studio rather than in the platform development; there are also risks associated with SEC.</p>\n<p>The main question is the development of the TVOD platform and the rights management platform: there is no understanding as to what kind of team will be working on it, and no technical description at the moment. If both platforms can be really implemented, the project is promising for investment.=</p>\n<p>For detailed information about the project, see: <a href=\"https://singulardtv.com/\">https://singulardtv.com/</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/SingularDTV\">https://cyber.fund/system/SingularDTV</a><br>\n</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Decent\"><strong>Decent</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>It is designed for creative people, writers, bloggers, journalists and their fans and followers.

Mass allows users to receive instant rewards for web surfing through the built-in p2p infrastructure based on the blockchain. As a result, advertisers will pay users a fair price for their attention and data without intermediaries.<br>\n</p>\n<p>An increasing number of customers are using ad-blocking software. Mass offers a browser extension and a mobile app that can block ads as well as protect personal data. Yet, their primary goal is not blocking but rather improving users' experience with advertising and rewarding them with cryptocurrency to establish a consumer-advertiser relationship and, therefore, reduce the number of ad-block users.

A similar solution has been already introduced to the market \u2013 the Brave browser. It blocks default ads and replaces it with incentivising ad materials. The bitcoins received from advertisers are distributed among users, the platform and the endorsing website. In my opinion, if Mass used smart contracts or a proprietary blockchain enabling further token emission to incentivise users and websites, they could compete with bitcoin. However, Mass token works on the bitcoin blockchain, which on the one hand makes it very secure, but on the other, has no advantage over bitcoin per se. In favour of bitcoin are accessibility, recognition, and a more stable price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Crowdsale takes place here: <a href=\"https://ico.mass.network/#/?aid=ep6oxa\">https://ico.mass.network/#/?aid=ep6oxa</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/MassNetwork\">https://cyber.fund/system/MassNetwork</a></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>All data and calculations are quoted as of 6 September 2016 with bitcoin price at $609.

I used to play around and use this phrase as a kid. Geez...I still used this phrase growing up. This one hit me pretty hard. I had never heard of Magic Mirror...and was blown away when I noticed the change. I will never agree that it was MAGIC mirror while I was growing up...ever. </em>\"</p>\n<p>Here's one person where the line hit hard- &nbsp;\"<em>Well it was a kind of incantation both to bring the mirror to active state as well as gain an answer to a question she needed surety about... I have watched this with my daughter when she was younger and of course I had seen it when I was younger and am completely certain of the verbiage used... \" &nbsp;</em>I tend to agree as I remember it as an incantation, which makes sense as \"Mirror, mirror\" as opposed to a greeting towards an object, which would be \"Magic mirror.\" &nbsp;Here's another along those lines- \" <em>I remember watching it. I remember repeating it, always wondering why the evil Queen could not think of anything better to say other than 'Mirror' twice. it made me think that perhaps it was part of the incantation, like saying 'mirror' twice would turn it on or something</em>. \"</p>\n<p>The effect is witnessed in multiple languages- \" <em>I know I am correct, because I am from Serbia and I have heard this phrase in my own language. I watched this when I was a kid and I remember the line in my language which is a translation of 'Mirror, mirror....'. There's no way it was any different, l am 100% sure. Even now days, kids in my country will say 'Mirror, mirror....' because their parents taught them. I just went on YouTube to find the 'Show White' synchronized in my language and to my big surprise, all recent uploads say 'Magic mirror'! It was never like that! But, I have found one upload from 2010 where the narrator says 'Mirror, mirror...' in my language. Again, I am 100% sure it's 'Mirror, mirror...' , as we used to say it like a song, it's etched in my memory.</em> \"</p>\n<p>In case you don't believe me that things have changed check out the footage below-</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqmIMvWnIV8</p>\n<p>The most common immediate response from people unfamiliar with the Mandela Effect for these kind of results, especially when they aren't personally experiencing that specific Mandela Effect, is to dismiss the effect as nothing more than memory problems, collective mishearing, or the more sophisticated term of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation\">confabulation</a>. &nbsp;It's a reasonable first response. &nbsp;There is lots of evidence even in my own survey results that the general population has extensive memory issues regarding events that took place 20+ years ago. &nbsp;The amazing thing though is that people that are extremely confident don't experience that gap. &nbsp;On one control in particular the people who were only moderately confident got it correct around 60% of the time where as the extremely confident got it right 95% of the time. &nbsp;So, yes, in general there is a broad memory problem, but in the group that usually has a distinct memory and thus feels extremely confident there isn't evidence of a memory problem.</p>\n<p>Well, if it isn't memory then this thing called confabulation which is basically just having distorted memories is called out too. &nbsp;Here we get into a difficult problem. &nbsp;There is often evidence available that \"old way\" of the Mandela Effect actually did exist, even though recorded history says it does not. &nbsp;That's when researchers find what they call \"Reality Residue.\" &nbsp;To Mandela Effect researchers it's evidence of a change. &nbsp;To Confabulists it's evidence of where the confusion came from in the first place.</p>\n<p>To me the issue comes down to scale. &nbsp;I'm going to show lots of examples below of products, quotes, memes, and media lines that use the \"Mirror mirror\" line and some that use \"Magic Mirror.\" &nbsp;The collective views of all of these things would likely come down to less than 1% of the lifetime views of the Disney movie, which adjusted for inflation is one of the top 10 most successful movies of all time. &nbsp;The idea that Will Smith misquoted the movie in 2 episodes of Fresh Prince lead an entire nation of people to misquote the line, especially after having researched the effect for over a year, seems ridiculous to me. &nbsp;While the opposite view that changes have occurred and it's evidence that the physical surrounding is malleable is also preposterous. &nbsp;I think that's why people have such a hard time believing the Mandela Effect could be real.</p>\n<p>Here's a video of an assemblage of Mandela Effects. &nbsp;I've found and included some of the links within this movie below.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaTDKl3EdQY&amp;feature=youtu.be</p>\n<p>Here's an older version of a Looney Toons video that shows Magic Mirror, showing evidence that line has been used as well in other stuff.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIESd6pqMdA&amp;sns=fb</p>\n<p>Here's a classic from Saved by the Bell where they are doing a Snow White play. &nbsp;Note the line

evidence the line \"Mirror Mirror\" has been used all over the place along with the line \"Magic Mirror.\" &nbsp;The question remains is the evidence gathered here indicate that reality has shifted and this is reality residue or does it indicate that mistakes were made in the past many times over and as a consequence of those mistakes people confuse what was originally and has always been Snow

Whether it was Al Qaeda, the U.S. Government, The New World Order or alien lizard people; it was a conspiracy.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/ObamaLizardfae8e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"/></center></p>\n<p>Any attempt to explain the events of that day without total and complete knowledge is a conspiracy theory. So we're all conspiracy theorists, okay? Let's move on.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Casting Doubt on Common Conspiracy Theories</h1>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg/552px-UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg\" width=\"552\" height=\"480\"/></center></p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to pretend to be an expert. I\u2019m no scientist, I\u2019m not an architect, and I wasn\u2019t there. But my own research tells me that there\u2019s a lot of reason to doubt some of the popular theories. I\u2019ll mostly be focusing on the claim that 9/11 was a controlled demolition.</p>\n<p>No, the towers did not collapse at freefall speed. They fell at almost half the rate of a freefall. This factoid may not convince anyone that there was no foul play, but if you want to make a case, <strong>don\u2019t rely on bad arguments that are so easy to disprove.</strong></p>\n<p>Stop saying that \u201cjet fuel can\u2019t melt steel beams.\u201d Everybody knows that. <strong>No one is claiming that jet fuel melted any steel beams</strong>. All it takes to cause significant damage and even collapse is a loss of structural integrity. Sure, steel will only melt at 2750\u00b0F, <em>but it will bend and buckle and</em><a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a6384/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center/\"><em> far lower temperatures</em></a>. Steel loses about 50% of its strength at 1100\u00b0F. Jet fuel burns at temperatures between 800\u00b0F and 1500\u00b0F.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To dispel another argument; explosions of dust coming out of the building as it collapsed is not proof that the building was lined with explosives. Such explosions would occur as the collapsing floors pancaked on top of each other, shooting out air and debris.</p>\n<p><h3>\u201cWhat about Building 7?\u201d you ask, \u201cAh ha! Checkmate!\u201d</h3></p>\n<p>Again, I\u2019m no expert. But here\u2019s a quote from people who might know a bit more than you and me. You can take or leave this analysis, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not trying to convert anyone to a certain way of thinking, I\u2019m just saying things aren\u2019t so clear cut, and people aren\u2019t \u201cstupid sheeple\u201d for believing one story over another.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many conspiracy theorists point to FEMA's preliminary report, which said there was relatively light damage to WTC 7 prior to its collapse. With the benefit of more time and resources, NIST researchers now support the working hypothesis that WTC 7 was far more compromised by falling debris than the FEMA report indicated. \"The most important thing we found was that there was, in fact, physical damage to the south face of building 7,\" NIST's Sunder tells PM. \"On about a third of the face to the center and to the bottom\u2014approximately 10 stories\u2014about 25 percent of the depth of the building was scooped out.\" NIST also discovered previously undocumented damage to WTC 7's upper stories and its southwest corner.</p>\n<p>NIST investigators believe a combination of intense fire and severe structural damage contributed to the collapse, though assigning the exact proportion requires more research. But NIST's analysis suggests the fall of WTC 7 was an example of \"progressive collapse,\" a process in which the failure of parts of a structure ultimately creates strains that cause the entire building to come down. Videos of the fall of WTC 7 show cracks, or \"kinks,\" in the building's facade just before the two penthouses disappeared into the structure, one after the other. The entire building fell in on itself, with the slumping east side of the structure pulling down the west side in a diagonal collapse.</p>\n<p>According to NIST, there was one primary reason for the building's failure: In an unusual design, the columns near the visible kinks were carrying exceptionally large loads, roughly 2000 sq. ft. of floor area for each floor. \"What our preliminary analysis has shown is that if you take out just one column on one of the lower floors,\" Sunder notes, \"it could cause a vertical progression of collapse so that the entire section comes down.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Source: </em><a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a6384/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center/\"><em>Popular Mechanics</em></a></p>\n<p>The truth is I have a lot of trouble believing that the government would be competent enough to pull of a demolition conspiracy of this magnitude, let alone keep it a secret for 15+ years.</p>\n<p>I see so many conspiracy theorists touting shaky interpretations of photos and videos as hard evidence and building entire narratives around them. Conjecture based on no evidence (or a layman\u2019s bad understanding of photographs and videos) is not more valuable or more likely to be true than even the difficult-to-trust state sources.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Don\u2019t fight fishy evidence with fishy evidence.</strong></em></p>\n<h1><strong>Did the Government Have Foreknowledge?</strong></h1>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Defense.gov_News_Photo_010917-D-9880W-034.jpg/624px-Defense.gov_News_Photo_010917-D-9880W-034.jpg\" width=\"624\" height=\"480\"/></center></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t believe that there was a controlled demolition. But that doesn\u2019t mean I discount all possibility of a conspiracy within the government.</p>\n<p>President George W. Bush said, \u201cNobody in our government at least, and I don't think the prior government, could envisage flying air planes into buildings.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t alone in making this claim. Both an Air Force general, FBI director Robert Mueller, and National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice claimed that they could never have predicted an attack where the perpetrators used airplanes as missiles.</p>\n<p>These statements are <em>demonstrably false</em>.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to list all of the warning signs that the government had. A simple Google search or a peak at this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theories\">Wikipedia page</a> will give you everything you need to know. I will tell you that through the 90s there was more than one plot by individuals or \u201cterrorist groups\u201d to use airplanes to attack U.S. targets. On top of this, NORAD had run a war gam scenario in which a hijacked commercial airliner crashed into The Pentagon.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2026My ass they never considered the possibility.</strong></p>\n<p>The U.S. Government also received <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/2002/05/17/clues-alerted-white-house-to-potential-attacks.html\">many warnings</a> specifically about the 9/11 attack in the months preceding it from foreign intelligence agencies. The attack should not have been a surprise.</p>\n<p>This begs the question: why would all of these top government officials universally make the claim that they had no warning when it\u2019s clear that the CIA and FBI had plenty of information that said otherwise? I\u2019ll leave you to ponder that question for yourself.</p>\n<p>I have my suspicions but I won\u2019t make absolute claims about things that I don\u2019t really know.</p>\n<p>Not only is there some shady evidence of government foreknowledge, but there was an unusually high number of shares in airlines and insurance companies <a href=\"http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/sept11/londontimes_insidertrading.html\">traded just before the attack</a>. Oh, but don\u2019t worry, a U.S. Government official said that there was no malfeasance. Everything is perfectly normal and above-board here, thank you very much.</p>\n<p>You can make of this evidence whatever you will.</p>\n<h1>What Do We Know?</h1>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/September_11_2001_just_collapsed.jpg/319px-September_11_2001_just_collapsed.jpg\" width=\"319\" height=\"480\"/></center></p>\n<p>Despite the claims of the rare conspiracy theorist, it is almost universally agreed upon that 4 airplanes crashed on September 11th: two into the Twin Towers, one into The Pentagon and another into an empty field.</p>\n<p>The government (and possibly other wealthy elites) had at least some foreknowledge of the attack. Whether or not their foreknowledge was specific enough to warrant action is a matter for debate.</p>\n<p>The U.S. (and other governments) have proven that it is not beyond their moral threshold or capabilities to target their own citizens to achieve political gain. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods\"><em>Operation Northwoods</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p><h3>This is what we know.</h3></p>\n<p>So can we stop calling each other \"<strong>shills</strong>\", \"<strong>sheeple</strong>\", \"<strong>idiots</strong>\" and \"<strong>morons</strong>\"?

Do you have favorite Steemit authors who have brought value to your life with their writing, but aren't raking in the steem dollars yet?\n\n# Incorporate TIPPING into your Steemit strategy to make Steemit a more welcoming environment and to grow the platform. #\nTips are a wonderful way to show your appreciation to your favorite Steemit authors, and to encourage new Steemians. Upvoting and commenting are a given, but sometimes you'll want to do even more to show your appreciation. By transferring just a dollar or two of SBD, along with a short message of support, you are letting the author know that their efforts are not going unnoticed, and that their voice is valuable to you.\n\nI've been tipping whenever I cash out my SBD. If I'm about to cash out $156, I will round it down to $150. Then I will use the remaining $6 to tip my favorite minnow authors. You could do it this way, or tip once a week or once a month, or just tip for a really great article whenever you find one. You could tip people for leaving really insightful comments on your own posts, as well. \n\n# Guidelines for tipping #\n\n* DON'T tip a whale, or a large dolphin. This will most likely be seen as vote-begging, and that's not cool. If you want to show your appreciation to a whale or dolphin, leave them a thoughtful comment.\n* DON'T tip with the expectation of any kind of return in mind. Just do it to show appreciation or offer encouragement.\n* DO write a brief explanation for your tip in the memo field when you perform the transfer. Something as simple as \"Here's a tip, I like your work!\" will suffice. Additionally, if you are tipping because you really loved a particular article, you could comment on that article to let the author know that you have tipped them. Otherwise the author will not know you have tipped them until the next time they check their wallet. (This can be good, too, if you want your tip to be more of a surprise.)\n\n# Your tips inspire more tips! #\nWhen you tip a new author, you are welcoming them to the Steemit community and encouraging them to keep trying. They might not be able to \"pay it forward\" right away, but once they achieve some success on Steemit, chances are they will incorporate tipping into their Steemit strategy, as well. The more people do this, the more of a welcoming environment Steemit will become to new authors, and the more Steemit will grow as a platform.\n\n# You can ask for tips, too! (Do it in a nice, friendly, lighthearted way--not a desperate or demanding way.) #\nOn many of my posts, I include a handy link at the bottom that encourages readers to tip me if they found my content valuable. I haven't received any tips yet, but that's okay. I do this more as a way to encourage a culture of tipping, than of actually getting tips (though I do love getting tipped--who doesn't?)\n\nIf you want to try this on your posts, you can build a custom link <a href=\"http://steempay.io/generate\">here.</a> It only takes a second, and then you can copy the code and paste it to the bottom of all your posts.\n\nThe really cool thing about having a digital tip jar at the bottom of each of your posts, is that ***non-Steemians*** can tip you for your work. People who find your post through Google, Facebook, or wherever. This can help monetize your content beyond the Steemit readership.\n\n# What do you think? Is tipping a good strategy for making growing the Steemit platform and making the Steemit community more welcoming? What are some other ways to do this? Let me know in the comments. #",

At the beginning of the WW II  German command decided to create a mobile artillery on the basis of existing tanks, which would be able to support the infantry. The priority in new machine were the firepower, a good armor and cheapness. The firm Daimler-Benz successfully embodied these wishes into reality. There were about eight versions of StuG III, however,  the main was Ausf. G. The cost of production of one StuG was quite low - 83 000 DM. Total was released 10500 machines. The basis for the creation was German tank  PzKpfw III.\nInitially StuG III was equipped with a short-75mm gun, but when good armored Soviet T-34 came to the fronts, it was decided to replace short gun with a new long-barreled 75mm cannon Stuk 40 L / 48, which surely hit the Soviet tanks. StuG armor was quite good \u2013 50 mm in a front took a punch at a distance of 1 km. StuG III was very compact in a size and had good mobility. The main disadvantage was little size which allowed bad conditions for crew working. StuG III took active part in a war from the very beginning to its end. \nhttp://i.piccy.info/i9/5dc09cebc0ddfcd1fac4a8013ee385ad/1473836240/182233/1063747/5u9ghQyvkTc.jpg\n\n>\u041f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0435\u043c\u043e \u0437 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0448\u0457 \u041f\u0422-\u0421\u0410\u0423 \u0432 \u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457. \u041d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0443 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0456\u043c\u0435\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0432\u0438\u0440\u0456\u0448\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0431\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443 \u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0456\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0437\u0456 \u0432\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u044f\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0456\u0432, \u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0443 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0456\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0443. \u041f\u0440\u0456\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0431\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u0456\u0446\u044c, \u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0456 \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430. \u0424\u0456\u0440\u043c\u0430 Daimler-Benz \u0432\u0434\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0432\u0442\u0456\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0446\u0456 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u0412\u0441\u044c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0437\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0444\u0456\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0439 StuG III, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0431\u0443\u043b\u0430 Ausf.

It was decided to create new Tank Destroyer based on the T-34, driving performance and armor of which were very good. Development of a new machine was conducted at Uralmash factory.\nSu-85 had a new long-barreled 85mm gun, similar to that which will soon be installed at T-34-85. This gun was able to destroy enemy medium tanks at the distance of over a kilometer, and heavy tanks \u2013 at 800 meters to a front plate. The gun was placed in the middle part of the Tanks Destroyer body and had angles of + - 8 degrees. Also the inside size of tanks was nice which allowed good conditions for crew working. Driving characteristics inherited from the T-34-85. Armor (45 mm at the front with big armor slope) provided good protection against German medium tanks. A little later, with the release of the T-34-85, SU-85 was converted under the new 100mm gun. It was a tool for successfully destroying any enemy tanks, including Tiger 2. Also Su-100 had a very low silhouette, which contributed to an excellent disguise. Observation and aiming devices have been improved. SU-100  was easy to maintain. This Tank Destroyer applied to the end of the WW II.

The development of this Tank Destroyer at first was carried by a Krupp company, then it was given to a Daimler-Benz and at last it was finished by a MIAG company. So, the destiny of Jagdpather was hard. The development has been complicated by the regular air raids allies, constant shortage of necessary parts and confusion in the serial versions of the machine. Jagdpanther took the most actively part in the Ardennes offensive and the Balaton operation.\nhttp://i.piccy.info/i9/d2e68a346dd9f511c77c83d8b77eaf87/1473836361/30639/1063747/XmYA_dzfCU8.jpg\n\nIn general, as a Tank Destroyer Jagdpanthere was great. Maneuverability and speed characteristics were good because of using \u201cPanther\u201d basis. Armor of Jagdpanthere (80 mm in the front with a good armor slope) confidently defended the machine and a crew at the distance of 800 meters from all Soviet tanks. The new 88mm anti-tank gun allowed to destroy the enemy at a distance of 1km. Rate of fire at the same time was very high - 8 rounds per minute. The fighting compartment inside of a car was spacious and was equipped with ventilation, increasing the convenience of the crew working. And don\u2019t forget than Jagdpanther had a low silhouette.

In contrast to the Germans and the Soviets, who had good-armored Tank Destroyers with a powerful anti-tank gun and mediocre mobility, American Tank Destroyers were oriented on a good mobility firstly. M18 was developed for quickly interception of enemy tank formations and the destruction of their flanks. This also caused the weak armor, small caliber of guns and excellent mobility equipment. M18 had been developed by General Motors Buick Division, the cost of one machine was 57,000 dollars. Total it was produced 2507 M18.\nAt first it was planned to put the 37mm gun, but very soon it was decided to replace it by the 57mm British gun. But this was not enough, and in the final version M18 was equipped with a 76mm cannon from Shermans. New Tank Destroyer had a very light weight, had weak armor (20mm in the forehead) and the rotating tower, which was unusual for that time. Suspension provides the convenience of driving on rough terrain; the engine allowed reaching speed up to 45 km per hour. M18 was easy to operate and convenient to use. In general, the machine was ambiguous, absorbing a lot of bold decisions.\nhttp://i.piccy.info/i9/df0129bd789f7923e8f0306e5a8b6520/1473836445/147058/1063747/pxmv2fJDVRs.jpg\n\n>\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0456\u044f

    "body": "http://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/0/3/IMAG03431j_6525197_23304303.jpg\nFans of extreme adventures will surely like my next article, which will be devoted to excursions to the salt mines of Soledar!\nWe began our tour of the salt mine with the instruction, basically it all comes down to the fact that not to touch anything in the wrong place not to go and to follow all the instructions of our guide. I think everyone knows that without a helmet in a mine is impossible, and therefore it is here also attached.\n\nAfter that our tour group in a special \"Elevator\" which in the language of miners, called the cage, was lowered into the mine. Just imagine the crate for fifteen minutes down to a depth of 300 m. So that impressions from the descent will definitely last a lifetime.\n\nI must say that the temperature in the mine is kept at 14\u00b0C to 16\u00b0C. Therefore, if you decide to visit in the summer \u2013 dress warmly in cold season temperature very comfortable.\n\nSalt mines of Soledar has formed in the Ancient oceans. So only here you have a unique opportunity to walk on its bottom.\n\nMine are all made of salt, walls, and floors. And in order to check, you can always try the taste. \nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/2/2/IMAG0362jp_9184718_23304322.jpg\nDue to the ions of salt, which it contains, even in the air in a salt mine the cleanest conditions, even much sterile as an surgical room. The usual guided tour, which lasts one and a half hours, replaces the 15 inhalation procedures and guarantees that at least two and a half months you will not get sick.\n\nSo, after the descent, we took salt corridors, featuring a variety of unique exhibits. Will not describe in detail all tell me about the most interesting of them.\n\nSo, for example, very much of the famous Donetsk palm made of salt.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/2/9/IMAG0354jp_9421794_23304329.jpg\nImagine here at a depth of 300 m is even a chapel. The thing is that in the past the miners spent so many time in the mine, that they had done a Holy place. Here you can free to light a candle for the health.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/4/8/IMAG0365jp_3366678_23304348.jpg\nAnd mine is an exhibition of paintings by local artists which are available for purchase.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/6/6/IMAG0375jp_4203456_23304366.jpg\nDid you know that salt is not only white, but red. Red salt is generally a very rare mineral, it occurs once in 30 years. In a salt mine is an artificial stone red salt, they say it grants wishes. So, do not miss your chance .\n\nAt the end of the tour, our waited main exhibit salt mine is a huge hall. Just imagine its height is 28 metres is a 9-storey building and a width of 17 meters.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/8/2/IMAG0406jp_5860409_23304382.jpg\nOften hosts various concerts, shows and so on.\nAnd on New year every year is a huge tree, which is accompanied by a Christmas matinees for children and Christmas show for adults. The holidays last from December 15 to January 15.\n\nIn the salt room is a football field where everyone can play football. And for those who don't care about soccer, here is a small movie theater where we watched a film about the history of the salt mine. Also in the local mini-caf\u00e9 you can buy coffee, tea and sweets. It will be a good addition to the movie.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/4/1/5/IMAG0408jp_4233814_23304415.jpg\nAfter that we went back to the crate and went upstairs. Be sure to find a small crystal of salt, it will be a wonderful reminder of such a special tour!\n\nIf the souvenir could not be found, you will be able to buy it. This mine is located near the place of sale. From best-selling variety , suggest, purchase salt lamp. Just keep in mind that for best results, the lamp must be made from a solid piece of salt.\n\n\nTour to salt mines of Soledar is an unforgettable, extreme, and most importantly very good for your health!",

    "body": "<center>![](http://svmassagetherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slumpshoulder.jpg)</center>\nHello Steemit, this might be something that can change your life.  Muscle pain is inevitable, it can be an old injury, or just something that suddenly start irritating you and it will not stop. Having over worked muscles or your posture compromised causes a lot of kinks and knots in our body.  Having deep tissue massage is great for alleviating pain. \n\n\n<h4>The benefits of have a deep tissue massage: </h4>\n* Increases blow flow in the body which causes healing to improve\n* Reduces inflammation\n* Loosen tight muscles cluster\n* Improve overall blood pressure \n* Breaks up scar tissue\n* Stress reliever. \n\n90 percent of the people who read this knows that massages are great. I'm an anomaly, I am not a fan of massages but I do believe in the benefits.  I do help out the family when I was younger when they asked for massages and I have a natural talent for it. They were confused and would ask how did I know what to do to fix their back. it still remains a mystery til this day. There are many reason why people can't get massages because of the inconvenience, money, or unavailability which brings me to...\n\n<center> <h3>Lacrosse ball</h3>\n![](http://d2ydh70d4b5xgv.cloudfront.net/images/7/7/mobilitas-mobility-peanut-the-original-double-lacrosse-ball-and-myofascial-1a1f82b10a664b959539aacdbdcf0a96.jpg)\n[Peanut Lacrosse ball](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0140NJXY6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0140NJXY6&linkCode=as2&tag=lasted-20&linkId=1edab9bdbe3612327d257f4edd57cfb5)\n</center>\nThis improve many of my family's lives when they started using it. My mother, dad, brother, and uncles all are a huge fan of these. The idea of lacrosse ball is to place it either on a wall and lean into or placed on the ground and lay on top of it to target stubborn pains and aches caused by tight muscles. It is used by many athletes but also adored by people that hate the idea of working out. The purpose (for example) is to place it somewhere on your back where it is the most uncomfortable and leave it there for around 20 - 30 seconds so that your muscle in that area would slowly release itself.  What I personally do is to put 2 of these under my desk roll my feet with them. \n<center> <h3>Foam roller</h3>\n![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VxfEt9NtL._SL1500_.jpg)\n[Foam Roller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KAEJ3V8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00KAEJ3V8&linkCode=as2&tag=lasted-20&linkId=08ef65112539bb10114ba72a89ab1edd)</center>\nThey are great for the overall body. Less intense as the lacrosse ball but they can improve your posture as you roll on top. Here you also do the same thing as the lacrosse ball you lay on top of it and find a tender spot and hold it there for around 20 - 30 seconds if you can and move to the next spot. I don't advise rolling the lower back since your spine is already curve in and your creating more of a sway back. This improve circulation on your thighs, side torso, chest, or any part of your body that can rest on top of this.\n\n<center> <h3>Theracane</h3>\n![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31VpBRHxbUL.jpg)\n[Theracane](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PRMCJU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000PRMCJU&linkCode=as2&tag=lasted-20&linkId=e0fcdc173eac78ceda3dccef5b82dcaf)\n</center>\n\nThis is the first thing I purchased when I had tense shoulders because I had a laptop bag which was a sling style bag. The uneven weight distribution caused intense pain and knots in my shoulder which I had no way of stretching it out. During that time I was a student living in the dorms. No car, not a lot of money,  and it was super inconvenient to travel one hour to see a physical therapist for a massage. This was introduced to me by my brother who has knots majority of his life because he had bad posture. I gave it a go and it worked! This is great for people who are in a chair and can't just lay down on the floor suddenly like in an office setting. This can be used when reading something on your computer or anything that doesn't requires hands you can start using this to help reduce the pain on your shoulder and neck. \n\nThese three products I always use if I feel that my muscles are tight or overworked that particular day. They are always in hands reach and has improved my over knot issues. Have a great day Steemit, hope this helps!",

I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/pastel-of-banana-with-chocolate/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](http://www.tudogostoso.com.br/receita/1660-pastel-de-banana.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "body": "## In this episode, a hot Aedapt girl helps Jack escape Killer giant Cockroaches! ##\n\n**Jake was peering through cracks between the plaster laths back into the room where they guard stood.** \n\n![enter image description here](https://s22.postimg.org/d4vifrmo1/Madison.jpg)\n***Missed an episode? Great more great reading for you [on my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr)! Be sure to follow me for awesome daily updates in your feed and leave me comments. I love comments!***\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not that smart when we\u2019re under. We can really only do what we hear them telling us to do.\u201d Jake whispered, calmly as the big guard moved within inches of the wall, snorting. The guard turned, blasted a hole in the ceiling with his gun and charged back into the hall. \n\n*They heard him blasting the door of the next room open.*\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve got this one on a signal blocker and there\u2019s not much time.\u201d \n\nThe girl turned and ran to a corner, where an iron hand rail rose up out of the floor in a curve. She disappeared through the floor and as Jack followed, he found a narrow, spiraling stair that led below. \n\nHe lost his footing and slid down the stairs, narrowly missing the girl. She stood in the room below, with ear to the door that led into the hall.\n\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.org/90derv079/spiral_stair.jpg)\n\n*Jake followed close behind. The girl with the violet eyes opened the door and stepped out into the hall with the awakened Nosher right behind her and Jack bringing up the rear. Jack had no idea what to do next, but the girl seemed to be in her element, and willing to help.*\n\n**Hopefully, she was not leading them into more danger.** \n\nHe followed her past one door, and into the darkened room where they had first started. It was empty, which could only mean one thing. The Noshers who had recently occupied it were upstairs right now with the ugly guard. They were looking for Jack and the others and would soon head back down.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we just get out of here?\u201d Jack said. He stood with his back to the wall and the door opened a crack so that one eye could see down the hall toward the upper stairs.\n\n\u201cNot without these,\u201d the girl walked to where the guard had been and pointed up at the weapons, suspended above. She ran a hand along the doorframe, \u201cIt ought to be along here somewhere.\u201d She said.\n\n**\u201cWhat is?\u201d Jack hissed, shifting as her body pressed against his.** \n\nShe ran her hand along the top of the doorframe. He froze; she smelled good. It had been a long time since a girl had gotten this close to him, junior prom, in fact. He did not have a lot of time for dating with his work schedule. \n\n*To top it off, the smell of burnt fries that clung to him even after an hour in the shower was hardly an aphrodisiac.*\n\nThe girl put one hand on his chest and stood on tiptoe, pressing tight against him. \u201cOh, don\u2019t kid yourself; you just happened to be in my way.\u201d She laughed, scornfully, and pressed a hidden button at the top right corner of the door. Weapons rained down with a crash, and she quickly chose two handguns, handing one to Jack. \n\nShe pressed the button again, and the remaining weapons zipped back up into position. Jack had to grip the gun in his hand firmly to keep it from joining them.\n\n![enter image description here](https://s13.postimg.org/xp1l7jjyv/guns.jpg)\n\n**\u201cElectro magnet,\u201d she said and opened the door, moving out, weapon first.**\n\n\u201cI knew that,\u201d Jack said. He flattened himself against the hallway wall, like a TV detective. The magnet had occurred to him, but in his addled state, he had not really grasped the concept. Mostly he just did not like the idea of her being smarter than he was. \n\n\u201cKeep up\u201d he hissed to Jake, who had managed to grab a revolver.\nThe three moved quickly down the hall and turned toward the front door. The two roaches Jack had seen earlier, peered out from either side. \n\n**They had weapons leveled in his direction.**\n\n*The girl crouched and moved forward as if she were still a Nosher. It worked. Jack followed suit, and Jake did his best. His human consciousness was getting stronger by the minute.* \n\nHe had even started getting color back in his cheeks, and Jack was beginning to notice that the man seemed oddly familiar, the more human he became. \u201cCould be a side effect of this Nosher thinking,\" he guessed.\n\n\u201cThey're right behind us,\u201d the girl hissed to one of the roaches. \u201cBlast the next thing that comes down those stairs, you got me?\u201d \n\n**The bug clicked and hissed.** \n\n*Jack assumed it was a yes, because the two giant insects moved in and took up positions on either side of the hall.*\n\nJack bolted out the door and was relieved to see the Rabbit zip up just in time. Phineas sat behind the wheel, and the Things were nowhere in sight. Behind them, they heard the roaches open fire, and then a huge blast echoed down the hall. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s13.postimg.org/4klau8zdj/phin_rabbit.jpg)\n\nA gust of wind barreled out the door, raining cockroach guts over the three escaping figures. Jake stumbled, and Jack picked him up and shoved him into the back seat of the Rabbit.\n\nHe turned back to let the girl in, but she was gone. Phineas stood up on the running board, slapping the roof of the vehicle furiously. \u201cGet in the car! Let\u2019s go man!\u201d\n\n*By the time Jack had slid into the passenger seat, Phineas had the Rabbit patching out. They were up to top speed in a matter of seconds.*\n\n**\u201cFind a me a safe dime!\u201d Phineas yelled, standing as he worked the pedals and tried to see over the steering wheel at the same time.**\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack yelled over the whine of the engine.\n\n\u201cDime, a dimension, get us out of here.\u201d Phineas pleaded.\n\nJack opened the glove compartment and fiddled with the controls, but nothing happened.\n\n**\u201cDamn, guess I have to do everything, Phineas grumbled, \u201chere, take the wheel.\u201d** \n\n*The Leprechaun ducked under Jack\u2019s arms as he grabbed the steering wheel from his position in the passenger\u2019s seat.* \n\nPhineas leaned across the stick shift, his feet working the pedals as he started manipulating the glovebox controls. Jack\u2019s view through the windshield changed every few seconds. It was making steering from the passenger\u2019s seat even more of a challenge.\n\n*Meanwhile, Jake hunkered down in the back seat. From where Jack sat, he was not looking so good. He wondered how much time they had left.*\n\nJack swerved to miss a slow-moving vehicle that had just appeared as they shifted dimensions. Finally, Phineas settled for one that put them on a narrow two-lane country road. \n\nThe town disappeared, replaced by rows of fences. Phineas braked and turned off onto the shoulder of the road, rolling to a stop.\n\nJack\u2019s heartbeat slowly returned to normal. Meanwhile, Jake sounded like he was winding up in the back seat, his voice rolling into a high-pitched whine, perforated with short puffs of breath, like a woman in labor on a late-night sitcom.\n\n**\u201cYou okay, back there?\u201d Jack asked, climbing out onto the shoulder.** \n\nJake launched himself out of the back seat, landed face down in a shallow ditch, and promptly lost the entire contents of his stomach in a single \n\n\u201cralph\u201d.\n--------\n\nJack turned away, pulling his elbow up over his nose to avoid the horrendous smell of vomit. Meanwhile, Phineas dove around the hood of the car and into the ditch, pawing through the puke as if he was panning for gold. \n\n*A few seconds later, he came up for air, triumphantly holding the thumb drive.*\n\nHe stood, wiping his hands on Jake\u2019s jacket, and then looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s past time,\u201d He said, pulling the transmitter from the man\u2019s neck. Jake lolled into the ditch; his eyes fluttered, and Phineas shoved Jack toward the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n**\u201cLet\u2019s go. We don\u2019t want to be here when they come to collect him.\u201d He said, climbing into the passenger\u2019s seat.**\n\n***Will Jake see the girl again? What about his Nosher friend, what becomes of him? Will they ever get the smell out of the ALICE? Stay tuned!***\n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

    "body": "# Why, Hello There, World\n\nHi, my name is James Brown and I'm what some like to call a \"health-nut\".  \n\n# Here's My Typical Day\n\n* I get 9 to 10 hours of sleep every night.  \n* I stretch and give myself messages with various self-massage tools for 45 minutes to an hour.\n* I drink at least 2 gallons of purified water.\n* I jump rope for 30 minutes on an anti-fatigue mat, 6 days a week.\n* I follow-up skipping rope with 5 to 10 minutes of push-ups, followed by another 5 to 10 minutes of bent-over underhand rows.  I do these together in order to give my body a balance of \"push\" and \"pull\" on my muscles, seeing to it that adding muscle doesn't pull my posture forward or backward.\n* I jog outside, in beautiful nature trails, for anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours, 3 to 6 times per week.\n* I do a heavy-lifting routine with barbells and dumbbells for 1 to 1.5 hours, 2 to 3 days per week.\n* I do a Pilates, core workout, routine for 45 minutes to an hour, 3 to 4 days per week.\n* I eat A LOT of greens, fruits, beans, nuts and seeds.\n* I especially eat lots of hemp seed (hearts), oatmeal, and organic peanut butter (heavy protein) - usually all mixed together.  It tastes heavenly :)\n* I meditate for 20 to 30 minutes in the morning and sometimes for another 15 to 20 minutes before I go to sleep at night.\n\nI do these things routinely and I LOVE doing it.  I feel great!  I feel healthy, vital, strong, flexible, calm and relaxed.  My mind is clear and focused on my goals and the people whom I love.  I'm happy and healthy physically, psychologically, and socially.  Everything is good :)\n \n# My Goal Here On Steemit..\n\n...is to share some of my health-tips and personal techniques that I've used to make it easy and painless to develop healthier habits.  I plan to share some of the tools I use to loosen up my body, making it feel wonderful and bringing all the \"life\" to the muscles that they need in order to get the most out of stretching and exercising them.  I'll go through how I approach exercise and weight-lifting.  I'll share my secrets on how to build a strong and flexible body in a way that's fun and effective.  I'll touch base on my diet approach and even share some delicious and nutritious recipes.\n\n# Keep Your Eyes Peeled\n\nI'll be around @feelinggood.  Throw me an up-vote and a follow if you like where I'm going with this.\n\nI'm so excited to share my secrets to healthy and happy living :)\n\n# Peace.\n\n<center><img src=\"http://quotes.greet2k.com/image-code/health-3.jpg\"></center><br>\n<center><([source image](http://quotes.greet2k.com/image-code/health-3.jpg))></center>",

    "body": "It was a real joy to share the first chapter of my novel here. For the new readers, [here is the link to it.](https://steemit.com/story/@infinitor/the-mastermind-chapter-1-an-original-novel) I got this very, very generic novel \"logo\" thingy that I think I can use as a placeholder until I get a full novel cover.\n\nWithout much further ado, here is the second chapter of our protagonist's journey.\n\n***\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/x3BiRdt.png\n\n<br></br>\n\n**Chapter 2**\n\n<br></br>\n\nThe piercing sound of the bullet-rain deafened Arcadius' ears. He was glad that he had taken cover behind the tall bookcase instead of the thin wooden table that was now ridden with bullet holes. Confusion overcame Arcadius. He couldn't figure out what was happening. All he knew that he had to stay in cover. Shootings weren't too common in Rome. In fact, this was the first in months, even years.\n\nIt was a massacre. The bullets came in through the window and wreaked havoc inside the library. When the rain of bullets stopped, Arcadius took a breath of relief with the knowledge that it would be quite a while that he would get to breathe relief again. The sight of blood was not unknown to Arcadius. He, like, many other Romans who had fought in the war of 2035* would have grown accustomed to its sight and smell. The bloodbath in the library had cost the lives of innocents, many of whom were deeply immersed in reading. Some were chatting about life itself, relishing its ups and dreading its downs. In all the chaos, something captured Arcadius' eye. I am afraid I do not know what he saw then and there, as he never told anyone. Arcadius collapsed to the floor and burst into a sob. Without a doubt, it must have been a powerful sight.\n\nThe police and the ambulances soon reached the scene of the massacre. The grilling sound of the bullets was still fresh in Arcadius' ears. The scene was burnt into his mind. The gray matter of innocent men, women, and children splattered across the floor, books, and tables. He started to repeatedly wipe the crimson blood that stained his white shirt but in vain. He was starting to fear that his head might explode.\n\n\"Are you okay, man?\" Leonidas rushed to Arcadius' side and hugged him.\n\nWith blood smeared all over his hands and white shirt, Arcadius replied, \"I'm okay.\"\n\n\"The media is going crazy with this one. Boy, the police are in some deep shit.\" Leonidas commented.\n\nAlong with the ambulances and police cars, there were cameras and TV reporters. *Their wish finally came true* Arcadius chuckled. It had been a while since anything big happened. The TV News stations mostly covered the weather, finance, celebrity gossip, and sports which had resulted in drastic fall in the ratings. This mishap gave them the very boost needed. It seemed like everybody wanted a piece of the action. For every victim, there were two reporters and cameras. A detective in black trenchcoat walked up to Arcadius, with a writing pad in one hand and a pen in the other.\n\n\"Mr... Straton. I'm Detective Caius, RPD.\" The detective pulled out a badge from the left pocket of his trenchcoat and showed it to Arcadius.\n\n\"Do you know what happened?\" The detective asked.\n\n\"I was reading this book, and ugh... all of a sudden, there was blood everywhere. I ran and took cover.\" Arcadius replied. \"Do you have any leads on who might have done it?\" He continued.\n\n\"We're working on that, sir. It'd help us a lot if you dropped by the police station.\" The detective said. Arcadius nodded in reply.\n\nAs the detective started to walk back to the crime scene, Arcadius asked, \"There was uh... the librarian. Do you know what happened to her? Her name was Axia.\" He hoped that the universe had saved him even a slither of good news. A part of him had analyzed the patterns in which the universe worked, which meant that he would have to hear something he doesn't want to.\n\nThe detective started to turn pages of his writing pad. After a few pages, he stopped at a page which seemed to have the names of all the victims. The suspense was crushed Arcadius. The detective noticed that. Perhaps, he took so long just to observe Arcadius' reaction. His grin - which seemed to be a proof of that - annoyed and angered Arcadius. Just as he was about to snap, the detective finally spoke.\n\n\"Hm... Axia. No one on this list by that name.\" The detective curiously spoke.\n\nArcadius was taken aback. He knew that he could trust his senses, but ultimately he decided to play along and said, \"Oh, nevermind.\" The detective gave Arcadius a stare and walked back to the crime scene, scribbling something on the pad. Arcadius knew that the detective had either written his name or Axia's under the *Suspects* section.\n\nLeonidas took out his vibrating Daelus Corp phone. \"Sorry, I gotta take this. I'll talk to you later.\" He said and went back to his car. Arcadius decided to walk back to his apartment which was only a few blocks down. Everyone used Daelus Corp phones, everyone that Arcadius had ever known. The Daelus Corp was leading in almost every technological field. Their phones, computers, and laptops were light-years ahead of their so-called competitors. And a thousand times cheaper. The corporation was like a conspiracy theorist's paradise. Though, their involvement with the military was far more than a mere conspiracy but still treated like one. Arcadius himself kept a flip-phone. Those were thought to be long-obsolete but were easy to find online. Perhaps he kept it as a memento of his father. Coincidentally, while pondering over the life and times of D Corp, his flip-phone vibrated. A text message from an unknown ID. *Meet me at the square at 8. Don't bring anyone.* The message read. It was equally thrilling and terrifying for Arcadius. *Who is this?* He thought to himself.\n\nAs ominous as it was, it led Arcadius to more paranoia. Arcadius was exhausted, he needed to rest. He had reached his apartment after what seemed like a decade-long day. He went up the stairs, to the right, and unlocked his apartment door.\n\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uTEQBjzP26g/UULYHWBYWAI/AAAAAAAAYyw/4M0IvR40LmI/s1600/Trevor+Tondor+modern+living+room+silver+round+coffee+table+hide+rug+blinds+Nbaynadamas.png\n\nThe apartment was an untidy mess. He stopped to admire the setting sun from the window in front of him. He remembered the bloodbath in the library, from which he had miraculously escaped unscathed. He wondered if he could fathom the pain the families of the victims must be going through. He remembered a dead body he saw in the library. *Jesus Christ, this day...* he thought to himself, dreading his luck. He lowered the white blinds on the window and wiped his tears with the tissue on the glass coffee table behind him. The kitchen was to the right while his bedroom and study were towards the left. The empty boxes of pizza, burgers, cans of soda and beer only added to his throbbing headache. He let out a sigh and went towards his bedroom. Falling down on his bed, the only thing that seemed to make sense at that moment was that he needed to fall asleep. And so he did.",

    "body": "Little things have scared me, like walking home on a dark night alone, thinking I was being followed, being attacked by my daughter. The one thing that has really scared me and made me realise how fragile all our lives are is:\n\nI was driving along the road to the metrocentre, Glen in the passenger seat and my 2 girls in the back. Jessica was playing up again, taking her seat belt off and climbing around the car, when we passed a crash, luckily Jessica noticed it and she put her seat belt back on, within minute of her doing this we heard a loud bang, there in front of me was a stationery car, I couldn\u2019t stop. I was doing 40mph straight into the back of it. Funnily enough about 20 mins before we hit I had noticed this yellow car in front with a private reg, having a joke I said look at that posh git, well yes that\u2019s the car I hit..*But it doesn\u2019t end there*\n\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/4jraqc61p/car_crash.jpg</center>\n\nWhen we managed to get out of the car, with my vectra a right off. We noticed there was 2 other cars in front of the one I had hit, luckily or I should say unlucky for me the car behind me had managed to turn off just before the crash thus leaving a larger gap behind.. so with me being the fourth car I was to blame, My kids were screaming in the back, thankfully nothing serious, apart from minor whiplash, scratches and bruising we were all ok.\nGlen went to help the lady in the car in front of mine, and went to see if the others were ok. He got told by the lady in the first car, she was sorry she had suddenly stopped as the person behind her had clipped her, not pulling over to the side, just stopped in the middle of the road.\n\nWe all got out of our cars and waited at the side of the road, luckily for us all there was a policeman on a motorbike on the bridge above, he had come straight down to control things, Us being the only family that needed to go to hospital. One thing we really shouldn\u2019t have done, we should have waited to hear what everyone else had to say.\nWhen we got back home and the very same policeman came, all the stories had been changed, she denied stopping, she denied being clipped and I was to blame, he had said luckily the road was very congested that day and the speed was only 40 mph, usually its around 70.. Scares me what could have happened and what I could have lost.\n\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/72czr0rrx/blame1.jpg</center>\n\nI had been driving for 15 years without an accident, Now here I was being cautioned for a four car pile up..the feelings I had were terrible, I felt useless, couldn\u2019t sleep or eat, I had nightmares with the screams of the kids.\nWhat really made matters worse was, about a month after the accident we all got a letter from the husband of the lady in the car in front of mine, thanking someone else for all there help getting there wife out of the car. That was my husband, and asking if we could please deal with this as quickly as possible..\nThe crash itself plays in my mind in slow motion, at the time of the crash I got a horrible taste in my mouth, the sickness in the bottom of my stomach.\n* What I could have lost that day*\nNow I am an extra careful driver, if I seem to be getting to close I get those feeling again, the taste in the mouth, the sickly feeling then I back off. Maybe it\u2019s a warning..\nMy kids still remember the crash, with Jessica over reacting again, she says, remember when you had that car crash and I broke my neck..It could have happened, if she hadn\u2019t had put her seat belt on after seeing the crash in front, she might not have been here\u2026it is to scary to think about..\n\nPlease drive carefully, take notice of other drivers, you could be the most perfect driver but if someone on the roads makes a mistake you could be the one who pays dearly for it..take your time..and BE AWARE\nThanks for reading\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/w3sdl01b1/20150513_135841.jpg |Hi I am Karen, I am here to write about my life and read about yours..

Clelands keynote presentation was given at the second international workshop for <a href=\"http://blockchain.cs.ucl.ac.uk/p2pfisy-2016/\">P2P Financial Systems</a> in London on Sept. 8 and 9. The BoE co-sponsored the event with Bank of Canada, Deutsche Bundesbank, House of Finance, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and UCL Research Centre, bringing together scholars, regulators, and practitioners.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/bv582tdtr/image2.jpg\" width=\"907\" height=\"227\"/></center></p>\n<p>Cleland was appointed in March 2014, and her signature <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2015/031.aspx\">appears </a>on british banknotes. However, her role covers \u201cfar more than signing the banknotes,\u201d the Chief Cashier explains. \u201cI am responsible for meeting public demand for banknotes and maintaining confidence in the physical currency.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a September 2015 <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2015/speech838.pdf\">speech</a> at the University of the West of England in Bristol, Cleland stated that \u201calthough my team is responsible for a much older payment method, we are not luddites, and we welcome the additional choice and convenience that consumers can now enjoy.\u201d</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/k1x7ue3wf/image3.png\" width=\"270\" height=\"166\"/></center></p>\n<p>Cleland confirmed the Bank's research into the \u201cpotential breadth of access to CBDC\u201d at the workshop last week. She described two extreme possibilities; limiting access to only financial institutions, or giving access to everybody. The latter would allow businesses and households to \u201chold balances in central bank money and to pay each other in real time with full and final settlement, in an electronic format.\u201d Introducing a CBDC \u201ccould fundamentally change the structure of the financial system,\u201d where everyone currently uses commercial banks or other financial institutions to make electronic payments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/5k00meclb/image4.jpg\" width=\"906\" height=\"194\"/></center></p>\n<p>This is not the first time a central bank has contemplated competing with commercial banks. In November 2015, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/the-worlds-top-bank-weighs-in-on-digital-currencies/\">published a report on digital currencies</a> asserting that blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) \u201ccould present a hypothetical challenge to central banks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Increasing usage of the technology could reduce or even remove the functions of a central body. However, central banks have options to respond to the threat such as \u201cusing the technology itself to issue digital currencies,\u201d the BIS wrote.\u201cThe question is whether such digital liabilities should be issued using new technology and be made more widely available than at present.\u201d The BIS referenced the BoE and it\u2019s ongoing research.</p>\n<p>In March, the Bank's Deputy Governor of Monetary Policy, Dr. Ben Broadbent, gave a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech886.pdf\">speech</a> at the London School of Economics asserting that there are two major implications of CBDC that compete with commercial banks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/et26wilhb/image5.jpg\" width=\"907\" height=\"216\"/></center></p>\n<p>Currently, retail deposits at commercial banks are backed mainly by illiquid assets that cannot be sold on the open market. If all accounts are closed at once, banks wouldn\u2019t have the liquid resources to meet the demand. A central bank, on the other hand, \u201cholds only liquid assets on its balance sheet,\u201d Broadbent said, so they cannot run out of cash. However, he cautioned that \u201ctaking deposits away from banks could impair their ability to make the loans.\u201d</p>\n<p>In June, Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech914.pdf\">discussed</a> the prospect of CBDC for the UK at the Lord Mayor\u2019s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London. \u201cIn my view, still some way off,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/iqpglx8an/image6.jpg\" width=\"905\" height=\"224\"/></center></p>\n<p>A BoE staff working <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2016/swp605.pdf\">paper</a> on the macroeconomics of CBDC, published in July, suggests that it would be \u201ceconomically equivalent to the establishment of an online-only, reserve-backed, narrow bank alongside the existing commercial banking system.\u201d It would increase competition for deposit accounts and rapidly increase the adoption of innovative technologies and account offerings, the authors explained. CBDC could also have other advantages such as raising the country's GDP by as much as 3%, according to one of the models discussed in the paper.</p>\n<p>In a one-off inquiry into distributed ledger, or blockchain, technology at the House of Lords, also in July, a few industry experts participated including Dr. Catherine Mulligan, Research Fellow at Imperial College Centre for Cryptocurrency Research. \u201cIn terms of central bank crypto-backed fiat currency, it does have a potential impact on monetary policy,\u201d she told the Lords, citing its potential to move money away from commercial banks towards a central bank. \u201cIt's a matter of balance,\u201d she said. \u201cYou got to think about that carefully to make sure the commercial banks don't just collapse.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the same inquiry, Broadbent <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/house-of-lords-told-bank-of-englands-digital-currency-is-some-ways-off/\">reiterates</a> the prospect of CBDC substituting commercial bank money, but concurred with Carney that it\u2019s \u201csome way off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Any central banks issuing their own digital currencies would be directly competing with commercial banks, Senior Advisor to MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative, Michael Casey, <a href=\"http://www.dtcc.com/news/2016/april/19/analyzing-the-digital-currency-revolution\">explained</a> during the \u201cBitcoin and the Digital Currency Revolution\u201d panel at the DTCC Blockchain Symposium.\u201cWhy would you hand over money to a commercial bank with all the risk that entails without any of the benefits?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have people looking to store short-term custodial funds with a central bank.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/borizq4ov/image7.jpg\" width=\"909\" height=\"169\"/></center>\n<p>The BoE is not the only central bank to consider issuing their own digital currency. Bank of Canada has also<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/bank-of-canada-looking-into-issuing-digital-currency-1.2834759\">considered</a> issuing its own digital currency. One of the objectives in the Bank's <a href=\"http://www.bankofcanada.ca/research/bank-canada-medium-term-bank-wide-research-plan-2016-2018/\">Research Plan</a> for 2016-18 was investigating whether the Bank should issue its own digital currency and what it would look like. In June, the Bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1117c780-3397-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153\">reportedly</a> gave a private presentation in Calgary unveiling its project to develop an electronic version of the Canadian dollar using a token named CAD-Coin.</p>\n<p>Digital currency is also in the works in China. In February, Zhou Xiaochuan, People's Bank of China Governor,<a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/china-considers-digital-currency/\">revealed</a> that \u201cDigital currency will co-exist with cash for quite a long time before it finally replaces cash.\" However, \u201cwith the transaction costs of paper money rising, people will be motivated to opt more for digital money,\u201d he believes.</p>\n<p>Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), is also actively studying its own prototype cryptocurrency,\u2018DNBCoin.\u2019 In June, the bank <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/dutch-central-banks-third-dnbcoin-prototype-delves-into-smart-contracts-and-trusted-ownership/\">unveiled three models of the Coin</a>.</p>\n<p>According to an August World Economic Forum report, <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Industry-Reports-2016/WEF-The-future-of-financial-infrastructure.pdf\">over 90 central banks are engaged in DLT discussions</a>. The total DLT investments have exceeded US$ 1.4 billion over the past 3 years from over 24 countries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/bfyjnjha7/image8.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"294\"/></center></p>\n<p>While central banks are researching DLT as a way to issue digital currencies, \u201ccould, and should CBDC be delivered using DLT and is this technology the best way to achieve the necessary scalability and resilience?\u201d Cleland concluded her speech. \u201cWe also need to understand the technology options.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>This article can be found on our website on</strong> <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/bank-of-england-states-central-bank-issued-digital-currency-will-compete-with-commercial-banks/\"><strong>this link</strong></a><strong>. &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>According to the</strong><a href=\"http://www.bravenewcoin.com/markets\"><strong> BNC indices</strong></a><strong>, at the time of writing:</strong><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.bravenewcoin/steem\">Steem</a> was trading at <strong>$0.53692706</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a> was trading at <strong>$605.91</strong><br>\n</p>\n<h3>If you enjoyed this article, remember to <a href=\"http://www.steemit.com/@bravenewcoin\">FOLLOW</a> and SHARE our daily content!</h3>\n</html>",

He also gains the ability to tame the predators of Oros. There are two tribes that threaten the Winja's existence which are; the Udam tribe who are cannibals and prey on the Wenja, then there is the izila tribe who like to sacrifice the Winja using fire. Your goal is to grow your tribe, and wipe out the rival tribes so that yours can survive.\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=s3ke52\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/s3ke52.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the map of Oros </center>\n<br/>\n## Gameplay\n___\nWhen you start the game you start with nothing. So you have to craft your own weapons/tools in order to defend yourself, either from predatory animals or rival tribesmen and tribeswomen. Once you have crafted the bare essentials you then have to start taking territory for the wenja. You do this by clearing out camps, and bonfires.\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=rhlw86\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/rhlw86.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the crafting Menu, here is where you craft items </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=w7e6ps\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/w7e6ps.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the Skills Menu, this is where you can level up Takkar. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2hx3g21\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/2hx3g21.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is where you can upgrade your village to get even more added benefits </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=1534mkh\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/1534mkh.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This where you can look at the resources that you have on hand. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2hgfg2x\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/2hgfg2x.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> You can use an owl to scout an enemy encampment, and tag enemy positions. So that you can get them drop on them. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=353cavc\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/353cavc.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the Beast Selection Menu, here you can select between beasts that you have tamed. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2e3o750\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/2e3o750.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is my preferred beast, it is a Bloodfanged Sabortooth cat. Isn't he/she (I do not no its gender because you can not check) cute? </center>\n<br/>\n## Presentation\n___\nI like how the game looks, and how it behaves. For example when you are hunting animals, and hit one with a arrow usually in other games the animal tries and runs away, but in this game you can hit it with one arrow but does kill it right away you can fallow its blood trail until it drops dead. Not many games do that.\n## Final Thoughts\n___\nThere isn't many games that use a prehistoric setting like this, and for that I love it for that reason alone. If you want to give this game a try you can get it for PS4; XBOX ONE, an PC for around $60.\nSide Notes\n___\nThe Steem that I receive from these posts allows me to purchase new games, and this helps keep my posts consistent. Also if you want to talk about games in general my information is below, and if anyone is curious I take my own screenshots.\n# @tygergamer\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GWcS5Dm.jpg\n[tygergamer on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ty.miller.3720190)\n[Join Our Steemit Gaming Channel](https://steemit.chat/channel/gaming)\nIf you have PSN my username is tyger1313\n# Thank you to everyone for your continuing  support.",

    "body": "I remember vividly the first time i held a golf club in my hands it felt very odd. And then swinging it and hitting a small ball with it seemed close to impossible. And yet, i had seen professional golfers, like Tiger Woods and Thomas Bj\u00f8rn play so elegantly on the telly, making it look so easy.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/eONRZ18.jpg\n\nBut golf is hard to learn and extremely difficult to master. It takes incredible patience, handling of your frustrations and training, training, training. And your game benefits from making long term plans and setting goals for success. It is an individualist game, it is always a competition against your own ambitions and image. Golf has the steepest and the longest learning curve of any mainstream sport or game as far as i am concerned. \n\nMy point is. These attributes of learning and playing golf are brilliant for teaching your children handling those exact emotional and physical traits. It develops your child's ability to handle emotions and deferring gratifications. It is simply a personality developing game that is also great fun, can be played with friends  and family for developing social skills. It develops good manners and adhering to a certain etiquette and playing honest. The benefits are nearly endless.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/mliTKWF.jpg\n\nTherefore i teach my daughter golf and we go hitting some balls on the driving range whenever she feels like it. So far we have gone 5 or 6 times and her swing and her patience has already improved notably. And she loves  when she hits it in the sweet spot and drives 125 meters ... Then we do a high-five and she gets a \"way to go\" :-) ... It is a fantastic way to share sports with your children.",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>When I tell people that I am a museum herpetologist, I get a lot of confused looks and blank stares. Not many people outside the biological field really know or understand just what exactly herpetology is. Herpetology is simply the study of reptiles and amphibians, or more accurately \"poikilothermic, ectothermic tetrapods\". That\u2019s a mouthful and complete gibberish to most people so I just say reptiles and amphibians. Herpetologists study the 3 branches of amphibians (frogs/toads, salamanders, and caecilians) and 6 branches of reptiles (snakes, lizards, crocodiles, turtles/tortoises, amphisbaenids, and tuataras), and their role in the environment. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/006/custom/nile-crocodile_643_610x343.jpg <a href=\"http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/006/custom/nile-crocodile_643_610x343.jpg\">Photo</a> and Credit</p>\n<p>Many people have difficulties telling reptiles and amphibians apart. Perhaps not their fault as reptiles and amphibians are often conveniently jumbled together simply because they are \u201ccreepy crawlies\u201d. Herpetology comes from the Greek word \u201cherpien\u201d meaning \u201cto creep\u201d, and literally translates into \u201cthe study of the creeping things\u201d. Seriously, reptiles and amphibians were originally grouped together because people thought they were creepy. So to help clear up some confusion, I thought I\u2019d post today and talk about some of the characteristics that separate amphibians and reptiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/reptile-4_copy_9098.jpg <a href=\"http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/reptile-4_copy_9098.jpg\">Photo</a> and <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptileAndAmphibianTropes\">Credit</a></p>\n<p><strong>Metamorphosis: </strong>Reptiles are just like people, they are born looking like a smaller, younger version of the adults. During their lifetime they will grow, but not undergo any radical changes in body structure. Most amphibians (barring a few species that look like tiny adults at birth) are born into a larval stage, usually called tadpoles, and will later metamorphose into their adult form. This metamorphosis completely changes their physical structure, sometimes adding legs, shrinking tails, growing lungs or eliminating gills. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;http://www.animalspot.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Amphibian-Life-Cycle.jpg <a href=\"http://www.animalspot.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Amphibian-Life-Cycle.jpg\">Photo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.animalspot.net/category/amphibians\">Credit</a></p>\n<p><strong>Skin and Coverings: </strong>Amphibians have smooth, porous skin that allows for the transfer of water across the membrane. This skin is usually wet or even sticky to the touch as many amphibians have mucous glands to keep their skin moist (allowing for respiration). Reptiles are dry to the touch and covered in scales made of keratin (the same material as hair and fingernails). There is a layer of skin beneath the scales, sometimes seen in \u201cscale-less\u201d pets. Reptiles are also occasionally covered in bony or keratinized spikes and osteoderms (scales with embedded bone serving as armor). Reptiles also have claws on their fingertips while amphibians do not.</p>\n<p>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6MGL3yTw0c4/hqdefault.jpg <a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6MGL3yTw0c4/hqdefault.jpg\">Photo</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6MGL3yTw0c4\">Video</a></p>\n<p><strong>Eggs:</strong> Amphibian eggs are encased in a soft, gel-like structure, with no hard covering for protection. To keep the eggs from drying out, frogs and other amphibians will lay eggs either in the water or a suitably damp location. Reptiles lay amniotic eggs, covered in a hard or leathery shell. Eggs are either laid on land or retained within the mother\u2019s body until they hatch, which she will then give live birth to the hatchlings. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.reptile-fossils.com/images/78.jpg <a href=\"http://www.reptile-fossils.com/images/78.jpg\">Photo</a> and <a href=\"http://reptilefossils.blogspot.com/\">Credit</a></p>\n<p><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Amphibians have external fertilization, in which the female lays her eggs and the male proceeds to fertilize them. Reptiles, like mammals, have internal fertilization and must mate to produce offspring (except for an odd few that undergo parthenogenesis and require no mate). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.vernalpool.org/images/16_amplx.jpg <a href=\"http://www.vernalpool.org/images/16_amplx.jpg\">Photo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vernalpool.org/sly_3.htm\">Credit</a></p>\n<p><strong>Respiration:</strong> All reptiles breathe using lungs, and inhale and exhale either through their mouth or nose. Some amphibians have gills and respire in the same manner a fish would. Others have lungs, but unlike reptiles, absorb much of their oxygen through their skin (though they will also breathe through their nostrils). Even most species that have lungs once had gills prior to their metamorphosis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;http://springpeeper.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/1/2/17123304/8783058.jpg?765 <a href=\"http://springpeeper.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/1/2/17123304/8783058.jpg?765\">Photo</a> and <a href=\"http://springpeeper.weebly.com/respiratory-system.html\">Credit</a></p>\n<p><strong>Defenses: </strong>With no nails and only basic teeth in some species, amphibians must rely on chemical defense to deter predators. Many produce toxic skin secretions that can have varying effects on predators; some taste bad, others are deadly (the tetrodotoxin found in eastern newts is the strongest vomit-inducing agent known!). Reptiles are able to defend themselves with both claws and teeth, and their scales add and extra sort of armor against predation. Some even produce venom which they inject to deter or kill would-be predators.</p>\n<p>http://wallsdream.com/uploads/originals/2015/11/22/snakes-open-mouth-reptiles-4xN2.jpg <a href=\"http://wallsdream.com/uploads/originals/2015/11/22/snakes-open-mouth-reptiles-4xN2.jpg\">Photo</a> and <a href=\"http://wallsdream.com/wallpaper/snakes-open-mouth-reptiles/4xN2\">Credit</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Though there are many similarities between these two groups, reptiles and amphibians represent two vastly different classes of animals, each with very unique characteristics. Originally grouped together for convenience, herpetology is a rather interesting field because it groups together animals that are not quite as closely related as we once believed them to be!</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "Vegetarianism is philosophy which has deep religious and ethical roots, the essence is the refuse to eat meat of living beings.\nPythagorean were vegetarians. Yogis of ancient India were vegetarians. The followers of Buddhism are prescribed to be vegetarians. Early Christianity forbade killing for food.\nI became a vegetarian at the age of 15. I remember clear this comic occasion: during another lush family dinner my dad putted the shin of the roasted goose on my plate. When he was putting this piece of once living bird, I claimed it for the first time: \u201cNo, dad thanks. I don\u2019t eat living creatures anymore.

Though they didn\u2019t object it, thinking that it would pass in a few months. But it wasn\u2019t a whim; it was my first serious and conscious decision in my life. They stopped ostracizing me only in a year after, during that year I experienced, at the example of a family as a social group, what it\u2019s like to have your personal opinion when the majority is against you!\nWhat did cause my decision to become a vegetarian?\nI can\u2019t remember the particular event, which marked the switch of my mind to conscious nutrition without harm to living beings. It seemed that I did it easily because I\u2019d been moving to it and at the certain moment I was morally ready to do the step. For example I remember when I was just a kid, at the age of 5 or 6, I was playing in our garden, thinking: \u201cWhy should I kill to keep on living?\u201d I didn\u2019t ask anybody about it, because I felt that I wouldn\u2019t get the proper answer from adults. This question gave me no rest; I often tried to solve this dilemma reasoning from how my childish heart perceived the world, which opposed all violence and evil. Understanding that this faceless, usually tasty grilled chicken used to be a living being, which had been born, had been a little chick, it was eating and enjoying life and then it was beheaded killed to make me think that I like eating fried chicken legs; it led me to the ideological confusion. I loved every animal, considered them as friends; on the one hand I saw people keeping pets and treating them as family members. On the other hand people killed an animal to have something tasty on their dinner table. And so did I, I was sitting and eating that grilled chicken.\n\nhttp://www.damex.ru/images/cache/660x495/crop/images%7Ccms-image-000013620.jpg\n\n>\u0422\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u044f

I\u2019d like more people to think about what they eat and do it consciously, how inhumane it is to feed on flesh of killed creatures.\nAs it is written in the Gospel of the Essenes: \"It was said to them of old time, 'Honor thy Heavenly Father and thy Earthly Mother, and do their commandments, that thy days may be long upon the earth.' And next afterward was given this commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill,' for life is given to all by God, and that which God has given, let not man take away. For-I tell you truly, from one Mother proceeds all that lives upon the earth. Therefore, he who kills, kills his brother. And from him will the Earthly Mother turn away, and will pluck from him her quickening breasts. And he will be shunned by her angels, and Satan will have his dwelling in his body. And the flesh of slain beasts in his body will become his own tomb. For I tell you truly, he who kills, kills himself, and whoso eats the flesh of slain beasts, eats of the body of death. For in his blood every drop of their blood turns to poison; in his breath their breath to stink; in his flesh their flesh to boils; in his bones their bones to chalk; in his bowels their bowels t o decay; in his eyes their eyes to scales; in his ears their ears to waxy issue. And their death will become his death\u201d\nhttp://99px.ru/sstorage/56/2013/07/image_561607131913053649088.gif\n>\u042d\u0442\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435

    "body": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/draper2.jpg\n\nThe below three marketing campaigns have impacted their respective companies not only with massively increased profits but the invaluable brand recognition that has made them household names we know them as today. Clever marketing can skyrocket a brand and even create a industry around your product - (see De Beers below). \n\nMarketers know how to tap into the collective consciousness and read the human psyche to ascertain the emotive reasons for buying, rather than functional. It's rare you'll see advertising that will actually list a products functions these days. Most adverts try to make you feel a certain way and relate that to their product. If you feel good watching a razor advert and that brand crosses your eye at the supermarket, you will subconsciously feel drawn towards it.\n\nHats off to the evil genius of advertising!\n\n\n**1. NIKE - JUST DO IT!**\n\nhttp://www.companyfolders.com/blog/media/2015/01/nike-300x170.jpg\n\nNike used to make trainers for marathon runners only. They recognised a fitness trend early and their marketing department thought of a slogan in the late 80's to try to surpass their closest competitors, Reebok. JUST DO IT!\n\nNike sales went up from $800m in 1988 to $9.2b  by 1998. The slogan was short, snappy and entirely relatable.  No-one really enjoys excising when they start doing it so the JUST DO IT! campaign tapped into what people were thinking. Want to start running but can't be bothered? JUST DO IT! Want to push yourself and go to the gym? JUST DO IT!\n\nA simple message that people understood propelled Nike to the forefront of fitness gear and they have been enjoying the number one spot ever since. Kudos.\n\n**MARLBORO - THE MARLBORO MAN**\n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/radiotv/graphics/marlboroman.jpg\n\nSelling a highly addictive drug is probably a dream product to marketers but having a cigarette smoker choose your particular brand is more difficult. Marlboro began running Marlboro Man ads in the fifties and they wanted to advertise the lifestyle of the consumer, not the product. \n\nDo you want to live free like a cowboy? Do you want to be a real man? Do you want to do you own thing? This is what the Marlboro Man represented. He was the epitome of masculinity and he allowed Marlboro cigarettes to fit into the lifestyle of the consumer and allow the consumer to have the illusion that that particular cigarette made him like a cowboy.\n\n\n**DE BEERS - A DIAMOND IS FOREVER**\n\nhttp://www.thediamondauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/diamond-is-forever-300x238.jpg\n\nPrevious to the famous De Beers slogan, engagements rings were not seen as a luxury item and didn't cost too much money. They were sometimes ruby's or semi-precious stones as a symbol of a betrothed couple. \n\nDe Beers changed the game. They thought that instead of promoting their product into the existing jewelry marketplace, they would create a whole new industry around diamonds. Now, even if a women knows the history of the marketing of diamond engagement rings, they will still demand one. That is how ingrained the marketing has become. \n\nAs soon as you walk out of a jeweler with a diamond engagement ring, it devalues by 50%. There is an inflated price due to De Beers stockpiling the product to give false scarcity and they have conditioned every woman in the western world to believe that a man should spend at least one months salary on a diamond. If that isn't a stroke of evil genius marketing, I don't know what is!\n\nMarketing can make a relatively inexpensive product seem luxurious and essential and De Beers carried this out masterfully.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nLet me know what marketing campaigns you think have been most successful below and if you like my work, follow me and check out some of my other posts [HERE](https://steemit.com/@doubledex).",

News seems to be first released 2 hours ago 12:35 pm; Thursday, 15 September 2016.\n\n### News Articles:\n[CoinDesk](http://www.coindesk.com/ripple-blockchain-55-million-series-b/)\n[CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/15/google-backed-blockchain-start-up-ripple-raises-55-million-from-big-banks.html)\n[WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-firm-ripple-gets-55-million-in-funding-1473944401)\n[Reuters ](http://in.reuters.com/article/tech-blockchain-ripple-idINL8N1BR24Z)\n\nAccording to the article linked above (CNBC) 'The start-up is currently working with 15 of the top 50 global banks including UBS and Santander.'\n\nNew and existing investors were involved in the new Ripple funding round. New investors included Accenture Ventures, SBI Holdings, SCB Digital Ventures, Standard Chartered PLC, and the investment arm of Thailand\u2019s Siam Commercial Bank. Existing investors that joined in this round included a Banco Santander SA venture fund, the venture arms of CME Group Inc. and Seagate Technology, and Venture 51.\n\nObviously this is good news for ripple with 55 Million accounting for 20-25% of their market cap before today's rally, the current price of XRP is 0.00001760 BTC and 2 hours ago it was trading for below 0.00001000 BTC, it has seen a large move already price wise although volume is still relatively small at this time, we could be in for an interesting time while this initial excitement settles in\n![](https://www.coinigy.com/assets/img/charts/57dab3f3.png)",

    "body": "<html>\n<h2>In my hometown, in my family home, there is a set of books bound in red leather, which I used to devour when I was a kid. It was about the History of France, and it was wonderfully written and illustrated. And among those illustrations, no other painting in it made more impression on me than the one called \"<em>The siege of La Rochelle</em>\".&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/x0f1oiwmz/ScreenHunter_27_Sep__15_18_17.jpg\" width=\"936\" height=\"553\"/></p>\n<h1>The painting&nbsp;: wide scale and great staging</h1>\n<p>This painting is <strong>1,90m wide and 1,12m high</strong> and exposed at the Musee of Orbigny in La Rochelle, a city on the Atlantic coast of France. It was painted by <strong>Henri-Paul Motte</strong> in 1881, in a typical grandiose manner of a&nbsp;XIXth century hungry for big epic historical subjects. I never could see in person, but what impacted me more than anything else was its staging.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here you have the Cardinal of Richelieu, standind, chin up, arms crossed, apparently calm and resolute.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/z2axp158b/ScreenHunter_25_Sep__15_17_49.jpg\" width=\"294\" height=\"431\"/></p>\n<p>You must admit that the mix between the soldier armour and the cardinal robe gives him a swagger fit for a superhero!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the left, in contrast to the Cardinal, you have a group of three monks. One of them holds the cardinal's hat (who would have been blown away by the wind) and the two others listen to a half-hidden soldier explaining what is going on. And a lot is going on!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/tpm3awhbv/ScreenHunter_24_Sep__15_17_49.jpg\" width=\"299\" height=\"286\"/></p>\n<p>Behind those huge aggressive wooden beams, a battle is raging. English ships are being battered by fire&nbsp;and by the rough sea. There are a few rowing boats at sea, trying to break through as well. But it's unlikely. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/4m9m4n92z/ScreenHunter_26_Sep__15_17_49.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"354\"/></p>\n<p>The way the painting is staged, you immediately know who is winning. Cardinal Richelieu is&nbsp;on solid ground, on the pier, and immobile. It's as if the ships are ramming, in vain, against his own chest. And they are effectively bounced&nbsp;back! The beams are nothing more than the extension of the will and the power of the Cardinal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Due to the perspective, the Cardinal is the biggest character visible. Behind him is the other&nbsp;group previously mentioned, who are barely spectators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/xnsp9s5ib/Screen_Hunter_30_Sep_15_18_24.jpg\" width=\"808\" height=\"410\"/></p>\n<p>AND if you squint a bit, you can see another group of people, far in the distance on the left, soldiers obviously at the foot of a tower, who are obviously fighting against the landing. But their size and their position means that they are nothing in comparison with the Cardinal himself!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/qnzweotkr/ScreenHunter_28_Sep__15_18_18.jpg\" width=\"411\" height=\"397\"/></p>\n<p>In conclusion, the effect produced is one where the Cardinal is not only the great planner-master of this battle, but also at the forefront&nbsp;in the trenches. &nbsp;Someone who is not afraid of exposing himself, even if obviously some cannonballs could hit him, like the one which has fallen a few feet away from him on the pier :</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/dl49vf3cr/ScreenHunter_29_Sep__15_18_19.jpg\" width=\"286\" height=\"126\"/></p>\n<h1>The historical context&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>Painted more than 250 years after the real siege of La Rochelle, this painting is inspired by the events which took place in La Rochelle between September 1627 and October 1628.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Cardinal of Richelieu </strong>was the Prime minister of the King Louis XIII of France. He was intent on crushing the Protestants in the kingdom, who had been given, in his view, too much rights by the Edit of Nantes (by the own father of his king!). La Rochelle was at that time the \"capital\" of the French protestants and Richelieu threw everything he had at it in order to subdue it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>But since it was a major port, the city could be easily supplied by sea by the English fleet. So, Richelieu ordered the construction of a 1400 meters long seawall in order to block access to the city by sea!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is the master plan of the engineer in charge of the building :</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/gk6l4sngb/1024px_Metezeau_seawall.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"694\"/></p>\n<p>It took 4000 men, a great number of sunken ships and four months to build the huge fortification. By March 1628, the city was completely surrounded and no ship could enter La Rochelle harbour. By October, La Rochelle was no more than a shell: out of 27 000 residents, only 5000 were still alive when the city surrendered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Cardinal of Richelieu had won a crushing and complete victory.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>The cardinal and his (14!) cats&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>Maybe a lot of you know the name of Richelieu thanks to the novel \"The Three Musketeers\" by Alexandre Dumas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/syzxmx45l/x510_richelieu_jpg_pagespeed_ic_M0_Lzx_Chp_EY.jpg\" width=\"354\" height=\"511\"/></p>\n<p>This novel has done a lot to cement the image of Cardinal Richelieu has an epic villain, the epitome of the absolutist regent, the puppet master in whose hands reside the fate of countries and entire populations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The thing is that he was extremely ruthless and ambitious and intelligent. He was in charge from 1624 until his death in 1642 and is credited almost unanimously as the creator of France as a modern state. He paved the way for the preeminence of the French kingdom under Louis XIV through his relentless activities in political, economical and artisitc matters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And also, I can't let pass the fact that he was a great friend of cats. Historians say he always had a cat on his lap when he was working, and at the time of death he had as much as 14 cats at home! And their names are even scrupulously registered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>All in all, this painting is a fitting tribute to a man of great importance for the history of France and Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>\n</html>",

    "body": "My day job brings me in contact with many mentally ill or abused individuals. We can be cruel to each other. I witness enough purposeful cruelty to grow weary at times, but never enough to call it quits. I have been thinking on this frequently.\n\nJust as [I choose to celebrate the positive legacies of those I have lost](https://steemit.com/relationships/@honeyscribe/celebrating-losses-in-life-and-death), I choose to celebrate the personal successes of the individuals I work with. Have they faced severe tragedy? Often the answer is yes. Yet they choose persistence and recovery. Even when they want to stay in bed. \n\n<center>(https://anonmgur.com/up/12ad11aaeba5286984df064b24c5bbc0.jpg) </center>\n\nAs a person who shares in their histories and their struggles, I am astounded. [I spoke about magic yesterday.](https://steemit.com/life/@honeyscribe/do-you-believe-in-magic) The repatterning of the brain through conscious positive thought was listed as magic to me. The reason is this: \n\nWhy keep trying?\n\nWhy get up?\n\nWhy love again?\n\nQuitting seems the simpler option, yet we persist in our belief there is something better.\n\nWe search for purpose. \n\nWe create entirely new lives for ourselves. \n\nWe succeed. \n\nI see it over and over. Humans at their lowest insistent on reaching for their highest\n\n## and achieving it!\n\n<center> (https://anonmgur.com/up/d7d4ef0d35598ec3e02d0eec2b919e6e.jpg)\n*Chocolate earned.* </center>\n\nLittle else in life inspires me so much. Especially as I know what it is like to *want* to stay down. Somehow I have kept myself moving. It is a profound statement of personal ability. \n\nI am adding to my commitment to celebrate. I do not only want to celebrate positive memories. I want to cheer for consciously positive actions, regardless of size. There are times in life when brushing my teeth twice a day is asking too much of me. To my amazement, as depression is no small hindrance, I always manage to brush at least once. From now on, I will give myself a round of applause for completing that basic act of self-care. \n\nI hope you will join me. We may need to look for actions to celebrate. We will begin to spot them quicker. \n\n<center>(https://anonmgur.com/up/3d0adddea5123c9d3e1dddbb2ddb99ae.png) </center>\n\n## What are you celebrating today?\n\n*All images sourced through Pixabay.*",

    "body": "Is this a typo? Benefits? You ask. How could there be any possible benefit from having a disability?\n\nWell, in fact there are. And here are three unexpected benefits I have personally experienced in my own journey living with a degenerating eye condition.\n\n## Improved lateral thinking and innovation\nGrowing up with a vision impairment meant that there were often things that most people took for granted, but which I struggled to do. To do the same things, I needed to come up with creative solutions and alternative ways of doing things. So from a very young age, I learnt to think laterally and developed my problem solving skills. Most people are so use to perceiving the world in a certain way, but when you are stripped of one of your senses, you learn to perceive things in a different way.\n\nhttps://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmWb5pzYhKKJZ8zmeYqVeV6oNqGi5h7yDEtxBbjwRdTUZ7\n\nWhen I was still living by myself a few years ago, I had the annoying task of having to cook for myself each night. The challenge I faced in the kitchen was not been able to read the labels on various bottles and containers. As a result, I couldn't tell which container was the salt and which one was the sugar, and all the packaging for the herbs looked the same. So how did I manage? Instead of using sight, I used my sense of smell to distinguish between the herbs, and for some ingredients where I couldn't use the sense of smell, I used different containers and labels to help me identify all the different ingredients.\n\nAnd this leads on to the second benefit.\n\n## Improved memory\nPeople who know me well often comment on my ability to remember things. In fact, I've noticed this in many other people I know who also have a vision impairment. I think this is due to the fact that for someone with a vision impairment to thrive in a sighted world, we often need to make extra effort to adapt to our circumstances.\n\nFor example, I remember when I was still in university, I had to do many presentations. For most people, they could refer to speech notes as they are presenting. However, for me, this was not possible, as I couldn't read speech notes no matter how big the font was. Furthermore, as I have some sight, I never needed to learn braille, which meant I couldn't refer to braille notes either. _As a side note, this is why the title of my memoir which I've been posting on Steemit is \"Living in Between Two Worlds\", because I have often found myself being caught between the world of the sighted and the world of the blind, and also between the identity of being Chinese but not fully Chinese, and being Australian but not fully Australian._ As a result, every time I had to do a presentation, I would always remember the entire speech. Over time, this has become second nature to me. I have learnt how to force things into my memory, and be innovative when I need to.\n\n## Resilience\nGrowing up with a vision impairment, I experienced a lot of bullying at school and a lot of hurtful comments and actions from people, sometimes done knowingly and sometimes unknowingly. Sometimes this comes in the form of a patronising comment, and sometimes from a look or stare. The interesting thing with people staring and giving me strange looks is that I can often notice people are doing it to me because I have some peripheral vision, however people generally can't tell I'm looking back at them because it doesn't seem like I'm looking at them. Most of the time however, those hurtful words and actions are done out of ignorance and a lack of understanding, rather then out of malice.\n\n#### But from all these things I've experienced, it has made me a stronger and more resilient person.\nAs a result, whatever unforeseen things I may experience in life, there's not much that can knock me out completely. I have developed the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and stay optimistic, because as they say:\n### What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.\n\nSo I'm thankful to God for the person I have become today. Disability isn't all bad. Without what I have gone through with my vision impairment, I wouldn't be the person I am today, and for these reasons, I am thankful.\n\nTo read more about my story, you can read my short memoir series.

    "body": "<html>\n<center><img src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j132/mgaft1/steemit/reset1_zpsvq2qnyuf.jpg\"></center>\n<p>Liz liked that his name was Robert, starting with the same letter as her husband\u2019s. There are certain moments when a woman wants to say the name of her partner out loud. Both men being started from the same letter saved her some confusion.</p>\n<p>She met Robert in Kinko when the worker messed up her set of copies and she requested a manager. She noticed sparkles of excitement in his eyes when he first looked at her and sparkles of humor when he listened to her complaints and, somehow easily, she let him lull her into resolving their disagreement in the nearby Starbucks. &nbsp;Nothing came out of it...Besides maybe a couple of sweet emails. Nothing. Yet.</p>\n<p>Liz stretched with the pleasure of remembrance and supposition. It was eight-thirty AM on Wednesday. The beach, place of her daily morning stroll after dropping kids to school, was almost completely deserted. She looked at the horizon and her train of thought switched to the contemplation of her life in general.</p>\n<p>She knew that everybody thought she had it made. Fifteen years ago she married a successful attorney. Now she was the \u201clady of the castle\u201d as she often thought of herself. Indeed she had a great house, Jaguar, a yacht, trips over the Atlantic where she got to dine in the restaurant on top of the Ethel tower, took a gondola ride in Venice and ski in Swiss Alps. Meetings with relatives, she could sit with proud and accomplished countenance if not with the hint of arrogance to them \u201call\u201d - well dressed, well-groomed and feeling above all their skirmishes and little territorial disputes. Roger and kids were her life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But\u2026 Was she HAPPY?</p>\n<p>Was this life to her ultimate liking? Something she chose to live or something she settled for?</p>\n<p>Back when they met \u2013 their relationship were new, exciting, different. Roger Powell came across as smart, witty, charming and certainly way more attractive than all other people in the town; certainly, much more, overall, attractive than Tony Beady - her high school sweetheart. And back then when she was twenty-two and Robert was forty the difference in age didn\u2019t feel so much.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But now, more often than not, she really felt it. His age manifested itself on the top of his head where now Liz could witness the color of his skin, with the heavy breathing when they were hiking, with the special diet he had to adhere to and a BP medicine he had to take and with (ah how unromantic) the sample of his urine she had to take today to the lab for his kidney test.</p>\n<p>But especially it was noticeable in the bedroom. From spontaneous and frequent, their lovemaking became much less spontaneous and, alas, so much less frequents. To hint this to Roger was humiliating whereas he as if realizing his shortcomings, became suspicious and possessive.</p>\n<p>If she could only return these moments of excitement, of passion! Liz buttoned her coat because a gust of wind made her feel cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, may I have some of your time, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Startled, Liz quickly turned around and shivered. Behind her, literally next to her, there stood a tall man. Not that she sensed anything threatening, in fact, he seemed as polite as an experienced salesman, but his sheer appearance \u201cfrom a thin air\u201d and his contradictory conduct made her feel alerted.</p>\n<p>On one hand, he looked old \u2013 wrinkly face, a completely gray hair, the eye color that used to be blue now dissolved into off white. On the other hand, his smile and demeanor were of the relatively young man, the one who knew of his charm and tried to make a use of it. </p>\n<center><img src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j132/mgaft1/steemit/reset5_zpsbyeecsll.jpg\"></center>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Liz\u2019s answer lacked confidence. \u201cAre you a reporter of a sort?\u201d Roger was a respected member of the community and, now and then, their photograph flickering in the local newspaper.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf a sort, of a sort, mam and, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t take much of your time.\u201d The man\u2019s lips stretched.</p>\n<p>\u2018Weirdo,\u2019 Liz mentally rolled her eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the man pulled out a gadget, what Liz originally thought, was a movie camera, but what turned out to be a cell phone looking device with unusually large footprint.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you please hold it for me?\u201d he handed the gadget to Liz showing sign of approaching sneeze. Liz held it through two sneezes and then gave it back. \u201cBless you.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now looking from his side Liz saw that the display panel had two viewing areas, left one labeled \u201cBio-Time Server\u201d and the right one labeled as \u201cBio-Time Receiver,\u201d with the button labeled \u201cTransmit\u201d in between. </p\n\n><center><img src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j132/mgaft1/steemit/reset4_zpsorggc6te.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>To her utmost surprise Liz saw that the left panel contained her information: </p>\n<p>  Name: Elisabeth Powell &nbsp;<br>\n  Biological age &nbsp;37&nbsp;<br>\n  Psychological age &nbsp;22&nbsp;<br>\n  Donated Age &nbsp;0 \u2026 </p>\n<p>The right one contained the information, apparently, of the reporter: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>  Leslie Berwick &nbsp;<br>\n  Biological Age &nbsp;77 &nbsp;<br>\n  Psychological age &nbsp;50&nbsp;<br>\n  Donated Age &nbsp;-43 &nbsp;\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Liz approached closer to the gadget.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cA little patience, ma'am.\u201d Leslie winked at her and then again looked down at the gadget that displayed green status line message \u201cLoading Transmission Matrix. Please wait...\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As soon as the message changed to \u201cReady to Transmit\u201d Leslie looked around the beach both direction and quickly, almost hurriedly pressed the Transmit button.</p>\n<p>The message box showed: You are about to transmit 20 Bio-Time years from Elizabeth Powell to Leslie Berwick. Are you sure?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWait just a second!\u201d Liz started suspecting that something was wrong. \u201cWhatever you are doing, I don\u2019t want you to use my name for whatever it is that you are doing!\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI am afraid, ma\u2019am,\u201d Leslie smirked, about to press the \u201cYes\u201d option, \u201cthis is already not in your power.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, so fast Berwick!\u201d Liz heard a new voice and observed the gadget flying four feet away.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, MacFearson,\u201d Leslie rushed after the device as fast as he could, \u201cdidn\u2019t you mother teach you to knock?\u201d The man, who kicked the gadget out of Leslie\u2019s hands was faster and took a position between Berwick and the device. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Leslie, who apparently used to act quickly, swung at MacFearson, but the later, acted even faster and with one short right hook to the jaw, dropped Leslie and letting him lay face down in the sand, picked up the device and turned to Liz who was in the state of a complete bewilderment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSpecial Agent Sam MacFearson, ma-am.\u201d The man bowed. \u201c\u2026sorry that you had to go through this, Mrs\u2026\u201d he looked at the left panel of the device. \u201cMrs. Powell. Luckily, I arrived just in time to stop him.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026stop him from what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026from stealing\u201d he looked at the device again \u201cof twenty years of your bio-time.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWell thank you, officer.\u201d By now Liz has already come to her senses. \u201cAnd you are, I guess, from the \u2026 future,\u201d she made exaggeratedly big eyes and lifted her eyebrows.</p>\n<p>MacFearson nodded as if not even noticing her irony keeping his eyes on the tall figure of Berwick spread on the sand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t I, knowing this all,\u201d she made a wide gesture pointing both to the device and knocked out man, \u201cchange something in the future?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMrs. Powell, normally we try to avoid contacts with the subjects from the \u201cpast.\u201d But since the contact has already occurred we are obligated by law to minimize the possibility of a bio-time theft.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Sam stopped for a moment as if struggling with himself. \u201c\u2026you see, where Berwick and I came from it\u2019s a common offense. Well, actually, the \u201ctime donating\u201d is a legitimate business, sort of like the organ donating in your time. But time is expensive and only a few wealthy people can afford it or it could be done between close relatives. So pirates acquire Bio-Time illegally and resell it on the Black market, which results in big losses to the company I am working for. \u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cBio-time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2026sorry. A time travel seemingly might gain you some time. But if you spend two weeks in Ancient Rome, you\u2019d still be biologically two weeks older. Bio-time would, in fact, make you younger or older depending on whether you sold or bought it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how come did this Berwick chose specifically me?\u201d Liz pointed to the old man who still lay unconscious. \u201cHow did he know I would be here waiting for him?\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cAn accident, pure accident, Mrs. Powell. What wasn\u2019t an accident was the fact that Berwick was going so far back in time. You see with the modern Global Planetary Security System (GPSS), it is close to impossible to execute the time theft. But GPSS is calibrated only from the year 2050 so pirates like Berwick, travel earlier than that. They make themselves both donors and recipients \u2013 sell their time in the future, jump to a remote past, pirate bio-time, make themselves young and then come back to resale it in the future. Berwick made his last sale two bio days ago - thirty bio-years to a broker in Hong-Kong. This made him quite old, the circumstance, as you could observe, that made it much easier for me to neutralize him. When Berwick is bio-young he is a pretty dangerous in hand-to-hand combat.\u201d MacFearson shook his head \u201cyes\u201d with appreciation.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless a large company like <em><strong>Travel Anywhere</strong></em> does the arrangements, it\u2019s a pretty risky to travel so far into the past, unpredictable both in the sense of the time slot and in circumstances of the landing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how were you able to track us so easily?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, our agency was tracking Berwick already for a while. We were just waiting to catch him in action.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;MacFearson stopped and pulled on his lower lip. \u201cStill I am not sure how he was able to bypass the transmitter security,\u201d then he mumbled to himself\u201c\u2026he needed a sample of your DNA\u2026 Tell me, Mrs. Powell, did Berwick somehow have gotten a hold of your fingerprints?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She wrinkled her forehead remembering. \u201cWait, he asked me to hold this thingy,\u201d she pointed to the device,\u201d while he was sneezing.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u201c\u2026Ah, there we go. Anything other questions ma\u2019am?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. MacFearson, what was that other number on the panel? The one that said I am twenty-two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, how should one put it?\u201d He scratched his chin arranging an explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s that age that describes how old you feel rather than how old you are, actually. Make sense?\u201d</p>\n<p>Liz nodded.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cAs for your concern regarding you affecting anything in the future. Don\u2019t even worry about it, because in a couple of minutes when we\u2019re done I will erase your memory of this incident. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s very safe.\u201d He added seeing her hand instinctively lifting to defend her head. MacFearson turned away from the pirate, smiled and looked Liz in the eyes. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSam!\u201d Liz screamed, seeing with her peripheral vision that Berwick within this short moment woke up and was aiming at MacFearson. \u201cHE\u2019S GOT THE GUN!\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MacFearson spun around pulling his own weapon. Two laser beams sparked at the same time and both men instantly evaporated.</p>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j132/mgaft1/steemit/reset2_zpsppg97iha.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>Shaken and exhausted, Liz sat on the sand with her thoughts in disarray. What was she supposed to do? Call the police? Which police, from what time, how? Did all of this actually happen? Oh yes, it did \u2013 the transmitter laid next to her on the sand. MacFearson apparently resets it but the power was still on. Whatever happened was unbelievable; made absolutely no sense. It made sense but only to her. No not only to her, to millions of people somewhere in the future. After seeing laser shots Liz was pretty sure of that. Oh, what a mess? Liz\u2019s eye watered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two people died in her presence and she couldn\u2019t do a thing about it. It was nice, at least, that there was no blood or anything. But still\u2026 The tears continued to roll while she wanted that someone big, strong and kind came to her and calmed her down. Put her in bed, covered her with a blanket and tucked it in \u2026 then, maybe, they could do something else.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Phooey\u2026This was just stupid. Stupid. She was a big and responsible adult. She could handle it. If only the difference in age with Roger wouldn\u2019t be so drastic. If she could only return these emotionally fulfilled moments of excitement, of passion!</p>\n<p>With widened eyes, Liz looked at the transmitter turning around the thought in her head.</p>\n<p>If she could give him five years of her life then their difference would be only eight years. Five years? What kind of a difference do they make? What is going to happen with her over these years? Nothing but frustration and boredom. What does she live for anyway? Is there a purpose? Procreation? Haven\u2019t she already done with that? Roger and she didn\u2019t plan to have more children. Certainly, she still needed to care for them and love them and stuff, but really, at this point in time, she was sort of living on overdrive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Five years?</p>\n<p>If she wanted to go alone with it, she better do it and do it fast. Who knows who else would pop up from the thin air? Nervously Liz looked at the device. There was no keypad except for numbers. She entered the number five.</p>\n<p>MacFearson talked about DNA. But how can she get Roger\u2019s DNA? Wait\u2026 Liz run toward the car got Roger\u2019s urine sample and turning away her nose she poured a drop of it on the recipient side of the device. Yes! Roger\u2019s data appeared on the panel. Now she thumb-printed the server side and her data appeared there as well. Liz pressed the button.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You are about to transmit 5 Bio-Time years from Elizabeth Powell to Roger Powell. Are you sure?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Was she? Liz was shivering. Was she really ready to give away five years of her own youth so that Roger and she could, perhaps, experience emotional fulfillment? What if not? What if this would be a stupid useless loss? What if the spring in a relationship only possible once? Her psychological age was twenty-two. This meant she didn\u2019t at all grow as a person since she got married.</p>\n<p>Robert, young, powerful! He was excited about her. Even now when she was so much older than him. With him, she would experience the emotional fulfillment once again and I would grow as a person.</p>\n<center><img src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j132/mgaft1/steemit/reset3_zpsf1wnbbtr.jpg\"></center>\n<p>Liz pushed the \u2018No\u2019 button, reset the device and quickly redone the procedure, now putting her husband on the donor and herself on the receiving side. Five years? No, I want to come back to the beginning, to the same point where I started.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Liz entered the digit fifteen and pressed the transmit button.</p>\n<p>You are about to transmit 15 Bio-Time years from Roger Powell to Elizabeth Powell. Are you sure?</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Liz said out loud and pushed the button again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

Its half formed little arm sensually traces the spot where a bundle of greasy black hoses passes through its skin, puffy and red all around it. \u201cI have...things...coming out of my body too.\u201d\n\nA baby\u2019s scream pierces the thick, humid air, barely discernible over a loud siren. Shattered glass cylinders all around, revealed sporadically in silhouette by flickering lights. Men in gas masks travel down the rows with hammers, smashing the cylinders that are still intact, spilling their contents into the ever-deepening soup. \n\nThe screaming suddenly stops. I search frantically for some explanation but cannot get up. My limbs, feeble imitations of what they should be, splash the foetal muck about but do nothing to move me. \n\nA maddening itching sensation surrounds the points on my chest where black hoses penetrate into it, but I haven\u2019t the fingers with which to scratch. \u201cIt\u2019s...not supposed to be this way\u201d I sputter. It looks at once quizzical and mournful. \u201cOh? How is it\u2026\u2019supposed\u2019 to be?\u201d\n\nAnother loud smash, and a baby\u2019s wail. The men with the hammers abruptly silence it, moving methodically down the rows. My tears mix freely with the amniotic fluid as one of the uniformed men, drenched in it from the waist down, arrives at our row.\n\n\u201cYou know\u201d the bulbous headed creature with the malformed little arm coos, \u201cI always thought you were pretty.\u201d It reaches over with its distorted, knobbly paw and caresses my ribcage. \u201cI would\u2019ve said something, but we were in different tanks.\u201d I recoil from his touch, shuddering as the man with the hammer finally reaches me.",

A\u00f1adir suficiente agua para cubrir todos los ingredientes, casi hasta arriba de la olla.<br>\n6. Cortar el chorizo a rodajas, de tama\u00f1o que quieras realmente. En mi opini\u00f3n, es mejor cortarlo a trozos y no dejarlo entero para que suelte m\u00e1s grasa, y de sabor a las lentejas.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/mlshm3e2v/IMG_9454.jpg\" width=\"1066\" height=\"800\"/><br>\n</p>\n<p>6.

An encrypted P2P network, %ames, runs on a functional operating system, Arvo, written in a strict, typed functional language, Hoon, which compiles itself to a combinator interpreter, Nock, whose spec gzips to 340 bytes.\n\n> What is this for? Most directly, Urbit is designed as a personal cloud server for self-hosted web apps. It also uses HTTP APIs to manage data stuck in traditional web applications.\n\n> More broadly, Urbit's network tackles identity and security problems which the Internet can't easily address. Programming for a deterministic single-level store is also a different experience from Unix programming, regardless of language.\n\nAn urbit is a personal server, a building block of digital sovereignty. Right now a dozen different companies control your data and you can only expose it by their rules. \"Server app platforms\" like [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/) or one-click personal server-side apps like [Private Packets](https://privatepackets.io/) or [Rocket Chat](rocket.chat) all have their heart in the right place, but Unix system administration sucks too much for this model to serve the general public, and the internet's public key infrastructure is still fundamentally insecure.\n\nThere is something to learn from urbit about every part of the OS/internet stack, but the most interesting aspect of Urbit to Steemians is likely to be the identity model. In short, identities are distributed hierarchally after which they are independent and just need to have neighbor nodes willing to route for them. An urbit name is best compared to a pronouncable IP address that is assigned deterministically, and looks like `~lagmel-dilfex`. Each urbit records the key update histories of all urbits it cares to connect to. Read more about it here: http://urbit.org/posts/address-space/\n\nThe company building Urbit recently sold 4 galaxies' worth of *stars*. A star can issue about 65k *planets*. It is in the best interest of anyone owning chunks of the address space to give away enough of it that it finds some valuable users. So, here we are:\n\nPlanet Giveaway\n---\n\nEach account that upvotes or comments on this post in the next 7 days will be assigned a random planet from the star `~lorten` (which has ~65k planets). Once the Urbit team has declared transfers to be [future-proof](http://urbit.org/blog/2016.8-update/), a distribution mechanism that uses your account's keys to authenticate (e.g. a message to you or a request for an input via comment) will be used to issue your planet to you.\n\nFollow this account for updates. Note that if you want to start hacking right away can [create a self-signed *comet*](https://github.com/urbit/urbit#start) and the existing network will happily talk to you.\n\nOf course, the disclaimer: This is a *free giveaway* and there are any number of ways your upvote could fail to turn into a planet. I will incentivize myself by not moving the SBD rewards for this post until the distribution is complete. If for some reason I can't deliver (like the Urbit team gets hit by a truck), I will send the rewards to @null. I also reserve the right to not distribute to accounts that I think are bots or otherwise just trying to farm identities.\n\nIf you have questions about Urbit I will do my best to answer them, although I am just a casual fan and not an Urbit dev. If this post gets popular enough I might suggest the Urbit team do [another AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbit/comments/4okcm6/were_the_core_urbit_team_ask_us_anything_about/) on Steem.",

If I used Poloniex or Bitfinex I would have done the same. Maybe I have some serious trust issues but I sense the winds of change are in the air.\n\n## These Centralized Crypto Trading Platforms are Just Too Dangerous for My Peace of Mind. ##\n\n<center>https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ozrRNp2cvPjl8B2/giphy.gif</center>\n\nA short while ago many of you were robbed on Bitfinex. This gave me a serious feeling of uneasiness. This also prompted a few geniuses in the Crypto world to move along decentralized trading platforms. \n\n## The Ah Ha Moment with a Crypto Genius. ##\n\nLast Sunday I had a working meeting with Ira Miller, the Ambassador of [Git Guild](http://gitguild.com). I shared with him my concerns and he promptly told me I was right to be concerned and that I should immediately take my BTC off of Bittrex. Now that was a problem because I essentially had zero BTC. I have 100% invested in Altcoins which means it takes time to unwind. I am one of those people who kept my coins on the exchange because I like the ease of access but I know this is not wise.\n\n## What Does Ira Miller of Git Guild Recommend? ##\n\nHe told me to start using [Bitsquare](https://bitsquare.io/) in the interim. He then told me his team is working on a decentralized trading platform. Of course my interest peaked but he could not give me anymore information than that. All I know is that I am thrilled to be working so closely with a visionary of the Crypto community!\n\nSo without hesitation I recommend you begin unwinding your positions across the centralized exchanges in anticipation of the decentralized trading platform tsunami coming our way. I am going to set up my Bitsquare trading account and give it a test drive. Stay tuned for a Bitsquare review!\n\n## Me Trying to Escape with My Bitcoin from the Centralized Crypto Trading Platforms. ##\n\n<center>https://media.giphy.com/media/l3vRkFsytsLileINi/giphy.gif</center>",

    "body": "In [yesterday's episode](https://steemit.com/story/@ericvancewalton/alarm-clock-dawn-an-original-novel-episode-29) Adam watched as Marcus was gunned down in cold blood at XenTek headquarters. The kill order was issued by Seth Busby himself. This was Seth's first attempt to show Johann he was indeed tough enough to take the helm at XenTek. This one decision will be something that has the potential to cast a shadow over the rest of his days. \n\n\nEpisode 30 is monumental in that it marks the halfway point but there is much more yet to come. \n\nDid Evelyn survive the night with the black widow spider? Will Johann decide to make more jumps into the future to steal technology from his own company? Who is this Ikeda person that\u2019s being mentioned (Disclaimer: he\u2019s my favorite character.)? You\u2019ll find out all this and more in the days to come.\n\nWelcome to today's episode of Alarm Clock Dawn!\n\n---\n \n<center> *Did you miss Episode 29 of Alarm Clock Dawn? If so [click here](https://steemit.com/story/@ericvancewalton/alarm-clock-dawn-an-original-novel-episode-29) to catch up.* </center> \n\n<center> Are you new to Alarm Clock Dawn? If so [click here](https://steemit.com/story/@ericvancewalton/alarm-clock-dawn-an-original-novel-part-1) to start at the beginning. </center>\n\n---\n\n<center> ![](https://s16.postimg.org/qqq0yhmd1/image.png) </center>\n\n---\n\n### CHAPTER 10 ###\n\n\n\u201cMr. Busby, this is Captain Ellis. The mission is complete. The target has been apprehended and terminated. Over.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good, Captain. Now it is imperative we find Adam Harkin. He's a valuable asset to us. Send out a locator on his Consumer Identification Card immediately. If he has his C.ID badge or Holo on his person, it will also reveal to us his precise location.\u201d Busby made his way to the director\u2019s office for an emergency briefing he had just been  summoned to attend. Only two people were on the invite: he and Evelyn Poltier, the head of Research and Development. \n\nTo say that Johann Pfizer's second in command was relieved that Marcus had been caught was an understatement, but Busby realized he hadn\u2019t escaped unscathed yet.\n\n\u201cTell me what the hell is going on!\u201d the director barked from behind his desk as Busby entered his office. The door clicked as it closed behind him. \n\nBusby's hands shook as he stopped directly in front of Johann Pfizer\u2019s desk. \u201cSir, the guard tried to escape. I understand that a kill order wasn't the ideal method, but given the circumstances it was our only choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Harkin?\u201d The director asked, his jaw clenched in anger. \n\nBusby felt the anxiety level in the room escalating, and his voice cracked as a result. \u201cSir, he hasn't been found yet, but Captain Ellis has assured me that he is making it his top priority.\u201d \n\nThe director sprung up like a tiger, grabbing Seth\u2019s necktie just under the knot, pulling him off his feet and across the desk. Seth's eyes bulged, his chest pinned flat against the desktop. Johann leaned down and in a quiet, snakelike whisper just inches from his ear said, \u201cListen to me very carefully, Busby, more carefully than you ever have in your life. We are now in the midst of a situation more crucial than you can even imagine. Because of your incompetence we now must race to clean up this mess. Ms. Poltier has disappeared. We tried to locate her Consumer I.D. signal and she's not even showing up on the grid. I explicitly told you to watch her closely. She\u2019s extremely smart and knows far too many of our secrets, secrets that could easily destroy us. Now use all the resources at your disposal. We must find them both. Do not fail me this time.\u201d \n\nJohann relaxed his grip on the wrinkled necktie, and Seth's eyes watered as he struggled to catch his breath. He straightened his crooked tortoise shell glasses and nodded. \n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d as his chest heaved with each inhalation. \n\nJohann walked slowly around the front of his desk, staring Seth in the eyes. \u201cSince I will soon be transitioning control to you, I'll have to brief you on everything eventually, and I suppose there is no time like the present to begin. Please sit down.\u201d Johann\u2019s voice had suddenly taken on a quieter, gentler tone. \n\nHe sat down on the corner of his desk and rested his hands on his knees, pausing for a long moment. Seth knew this was the precise point where his reality finally caught up with his dreams and his destiny became forever intertwined with XenTek. The silence of this moment seemed deafening as he took what would be his last breath of innocence.\n\n\u201cSeth, what I'm about to tell you will surely change you. It will alter what you believed was your reality and it will come as a shock. A lot of things have happened in the last few decades that a very small and a very select group of people in the world have official knowledge about. What I told the board members last night about the UFO wreckage and the exclusive contracts that XenTek secured from our government was true, but it was only the beginning.\u201d\n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/qoZYnzZHq3ziM.gif) </center>\n\nBusby shifted forward in anticipation and pushed up his glasses onto the bridge of his nose with his finger as the director continued.\n\n\u201cXenTek had released most of the products reverse engineered from the wreckage in fifteen short years. We are talking about lasers, the semiconductor, and fiber optics. We were desperate for more, as were our shareholders. Our programmers uncovered things we were never meant to learn in the craft\u2019s computers about several different alien civilizations. This knowledge was even more valuable than any of the technology we harvested. We eventually deciphered their written languages, and we began reaching out to communicate with a certain group of them that were known to openly trade with civilizations less advanced than their own.\u201d\n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/lrYGEvZp97wTS.gif) </center>\n\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, just a few years after I took over XenTek, we held open, face-to-face meetings between our company, the government, and the Agemo. The Agemo are composed of two different neighboring civilizations that have joined forces. The Agemo group sent a team of diplomats that landed in their craft at night right in the Terra Valley on the very site where the Phoenix collider is today.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll of this has been kept secret from the Consumers of this world. The government was very concerned about losing control of the population and causing mass hysteria, so when any news related to this did leak, it was always counterbalanced in the media with false news stories, and it worked wonderfully. Seth, these civilizations are millions of years more advanced than our own, but we quickly learned that just like us, some were good and some were bad. Oh, what a glorious night that was! It was our finest hour. We struck two major agreements from that particular round of negotiations.\u201d\n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/11Iy9AE36WSTOo.gif) </center>\n\nJohann smiled as he paused for a moment to reminisce. He got up from his desk and looked out the window, putting his hands in his pants pockets as he continued. \u201cThe faction of the Agemo just needed one thing\u2014gold and lots of it. Their home planet was becoming too warm and their plan was to suspend fine gold dust in their atmosphere to help reflect the sun's heat away from their planet. Do you remember when our government moved away from the gold standard that backed our currency?\u201d \n\nSeth\u2019s brain was on complete overload and he could only manage to nod his head in shock.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n<center> ![](https://s18.postimg.org/9phdrughl/TBC.png) </center>\n\n---\n\n*Alarm Clock Dawn is the first novel of a trilogy. The sequel entitled, Truth Is Stranger, will be published in the Spring of 2017.*\n\n<center> ![](https://s14.postimg.org/dlcthfcxd/image.jpg) </center>\n\nPlease visit [my website](http://www.ericvancewalton.net) to sign up for my author newsletter.

Parallel to my research activities on the above topics, I (try to) **transmit my passion** to new generations of young students and to the general audience (which includes Steemit). \n\n\nSince my arrival on Steemit, I have started the writing of a few series of posts:\n  * An introduction to particle physics: [the basics](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/the-bestiary-of-particle-physics-this-is-how-i-introduced-particle-physics-to-cern-summer-students), [Higgs-theory](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/particle-physics-lectures-demystifying-the-higgs-boson-the-theory-context) and [Higgs-experiment](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/demystifying-the-experimental-quest-for-the-higgs-boson);\n * News about my own research activities: [new phenomena and photons](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/my-own-research-on-steemit-new-phenomena-at-the-cern-large-hadron-collider-cornered-with-photons);\n * Fresh news about CERN results: [MoEAL](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/live-from-cern-no-magnetic-monopole-has-been-found), [the economical impact of the LHC](https://steemit.com/academia/@lemouth/connecting-steemit-scientific-research-and-academia);\n * Scrutinizing important scientific results: [the fifth force](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/new-particle-physics-results-have-we-found-a-fifth-force-of-nature), [Dragonfly 44](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/dragonfly-44-a-galaxy-of-the-dark-side-made-of-dark-matter).\n\n*Depuis mon arrivee sur Steemit, j\u2019ai demarre l'ecriture de plusieurs series de posts:*\n* *Une introduction a la physique des particules: [generalites](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/the-bestiary-of-particle-physics-this-is-how-i-introduced-particle-physics-to-cern-summer-students), [Higgs-theorie](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/particle-physics-lectures-demystifying-the-higgs-boson-the-theory-context) et [Higgs-experimental](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/demystifying-the-experimental-quest-for-the-higgs-boson)* ;\n * *Des nouvelles de mes propres activites de recherche: [phenomenes nouveaux avec des photons](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/my-own-research-on-steemit-new-phenomena-at-the-cern-large-hadron-collider-cornered-with-photons)* ;\n * *Des nouvelles sur les resultats du CERN: [MoEAL](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/live-from-cern-no-magnetic-monopole-has-been-found), [l'impact economique du LHC](https://steemit.com/academia/@lemouth/connecting-steemit-scientific-research-and-academia)* ;\n * *Des nouvelles scientifiques importantes: [la cinquieme force](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/new-particle-physics-results-have-we-found-a-fifth-force-of-nature), [Dragonfly 44](https://steemit.com/science/@lemouth/dragonfly-44-a-galaxy-of-the-dark-side-made-of-dark-matter)* .\n\nI will of course continue writing posts on those topics, and I have also some new series to start in my mind. \n*Je vais bien entendu continuer a ecrire a propos des sujets mentionnes ci-dessus.* \n\n<br />\n\n![](https://steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/lhc_long_1452ab.jpg)  [image credits: [CERN](https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider)]\n\nI am planning to render **all future posts related to CERN bilingual**. According to the feedback of the readers (this is you!), I may write new posts on different topics also bilingually in the future. \n\n*Je compte rendre **tous mes futurs posts relies au CERN bilingues**.  En fonction du retour, je pourrais eventuellement ecrire des posts bilingues sur des nouveaux sujets dans le futur.* \n\n\n#### I believe having a nice ensemble of quality posts in French could be useful for the network, and I am glad to take part to the feeding of the \u2018fundamental physics\u2019 section. ####\n\n#### *Je crois qu\u2019avoir une bonne serie de posts de qualite en francais sur Steemit pourrait etre utile pour la plateforme, et je vais prendre plaisir a alimenter la categorie \u2018physique fondamentale\u2019.* ####\n\n___\n\n#### *Rendez-vous pour la fin de semaine ou lundi prochain (oui je suis parfois occupe et j\u2019ai du mal a ecrire plus qu\u2019un ou deux posts par semaine) pour mon premier post de physique bilingue!* ####\n#### See you on the week-end or on next Monday (I am kind of very busy and I cannot write more than one or two posts per week) for my first bilingual post on physics! ####\n___",

It is so addicting meeting with new people and exchanging ideas with each other and support them. So I thought it is time to support steemit as best as I can and organised steemit meetup yesterday(<strong>14th Sep</strong>, 2016) at <strong>QED42, Pune, India.</strong></p>\n<br>\n<center>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/meetuIndiaa4044.png\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1200\"/></p></center>\n<br>\n<p>It was a very <strong>amazing, cheerful and informative evening</strong>. I started with some <strong>great facts about steemit and followed by detailed explanation of Steem Power, Steem Dollars, Reputation and sharing content</strong>. I encouraged them to post only <strong>original and genuine content</strong> or otherwise they are going to get banned. I had to explain all these things because they had never heard of that kind of social media platform. <strong>All the people were like \u201cIs it for real?\u201d, \u201cHow do they get so much money?\u201d, \u201cIs there is any joining fee?\u201d and more.</strong> I answered them as best as I could and <strong>motivated them by giving example of @liberosist and how did he started and look where he is now?.</strong> The response was pretty good and I felt that they felt motivated. &nbsp;</p>\n<br>\n<center>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/20160915_1656470e974.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG-20160914-WA00058087c.jpg\" width=\"1152\" height=\"864\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG-20160914-WA0007caf12.jpg\" width=\"864\" height=\"1152\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG-20160914-WA0004e90dc.jpg\" width=\"1080\" height=\"810\"/></p>\n<br>\n</center>\n<p><strong>There are very few people from India who are using steemit</strong> and have found only 10-15 people on steemit that are from India. <strong>This is way too low percentage.</strong> It may be because most of the people have <strong>never heard of this crypto social blogging platform</strong>. <strong>Now, I have set my goals.

    "body": "<center> https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/StepBrothers/StepBrothers_3lg.jpg </center>\n\nSociety has a lot to say about you if you are still living at home past a certain age. And this seems to be the case for more individuals these days as an increasing number get out of school, loaded with student loan debt, and unable to find a job. Real estate bubbles fueling sky-rocketing house prices, thanks to the Federal Reserve and its low interest rates, also haven't been helping the matter. \n\n<center> https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2016/07/24/636049157125156907828879602_white.jpg </center>\n\nBack only a couple of decades ago,  it seemed like you didn't need that great of a job and yet you could still afford to get a home and live on your own, but now millions of people are finding it's difficult to get by even when both parents are out in the work force. \n\n<center> https://media1.giphy.com/media/J8Iqja8CXfMw8/200_s.gif </center> \n\nMy friend Steven just turned 32 and he still lives at home while trying to save up for his own place, and while trying to pay off student loans and other debts. He could technically move out on his own now, he has the ability and funds to, but if he did then he would struggle with a much lower standard of living. Instead of choosing that option, he decides to stay right where he is because that way he can have a higher standard of living; although he'll need to put-up with the negative judgments from others about choosing to still live at home.\n\n<center> https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/bhLi9N3ce2mQpEotY50okUmzfw4/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2014/12/03/068/n/1922283/88078dd8a2c177bf_tumblr_m2wow2jYeD1qgcra2o1_r1_500/i/When-He-Says-What-We-All-Wanted.gif </center> \nFor some people they really just can't get along with their families for too much time and for their own sanity and healthy it's probably better that they separate and try to live on their own. But for the families that can get along and work positively and peacefully together as a network, what drawback is there to living at home past a certain age, aside from the negative judgments associated with it? If anything, I see a lot of benefit that can be had from living this way. \n\n<center> http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/5616x3741+0+2/resize/640x426!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://hss-prod.hss.aol.com/hss/storage/adam/73d6ba71eca9fdac90982fda290eedb7/83590572.jpg </center> \n\nFor example, my friend Karen and her husband still choose to live at home with her family. They have a beautiful home with lots of room for everyone and there are at the moment 7 people living in the house, because the grandparents live downstairs while the parents and kids live upstairs. \n\nThe grandparents are always there to babysit the kids, cook when its needed, and the kids and parents can offer the grandparents help too whenever they need it, like rides to the doctor or grocery store, or maybe help with some yard work. They work together peacefully and voluntarily in order to help each other and they all benefit from it and are able to have a higher standard of living because of it. \n\n<center> http://grandmother-blog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Living-with-parents.jpg </center> \n\nIt's easy to shame people who still live at home but I try not to be too quick in rushing to judgment because you never know what circumstances brought them there. And for all I know they could be enjoying a much higher standard of living than my own, who am I to judge? I think there can be a lot of benefit to living with family so that you can help one another and it also helps to save potentially hundreds if not thousands of dollars.",

    "body": "It's been a few weeks since I posted the article about food sovereignty and O.N.E. group's efforts to bring local food production back home to the local level. This time I have more pictures than words to share, and I hope you will find this post worthy of your upvote and even better, [a donation to help us out! ](https://www.gofundme.com/27sp5f8) Thanks for stopping by. If you missed the previous article I encourage you to [click here and read it](https://steemit.com/community/@full-steem-ahead/2s95sn-o-n-e-group-returns-to-local-food-sovereignty).\n\nHere is the old Ledbetter store. The building is too far gone to fix, but the owner is keen on finding a grant to restore the old historical landmark and establish it as a tourist attraction and focal point for locals to meet, hangout and also for local growers to sell their produce. \n\n<center> https://s13.postimg.org/zf11pzc8n/IMG_20160901_122745.jpg </center>\n\nA little history of the place. On August 1, 1960, the town of Lutie ceased to exist, being renamed to Theodosia, the current name. All that is left of Lutie is the cemetery, the name on one of the churches, and the school. The Ledbetter store still stands, tho the sign in front saying \"groceries, feed, and gas\" is now gone. It was Lutie's last post office. Since then, Theodosia has grown and is now the \"Record Bass Capital of Missouri.\" It was incorporated in 1970 and had 245 residents by 1990.  \n\nBack to the sorghum project topic. We've had a higher than usual amount of rainfall this year so the weeds got as high as 6 - 8 feet tall. Here is the site just after we cleaned all of the weeds out.\n\n<center>https://s10.postimg.org/q0eo3v7tl/IMG_20160901_122619.jpg</center>\n\nThere is only one local concrete business, and so they are very busy. They agreed to work weekends or after normal business hours to fit us in so we can finish construction before the sorghum is ready to harvest. Here you see the forms for the pour. One issue we discovered was there wasn't enough difference in height between the city's sewer line and the drain pipe, so it required a couple of loads of gravel to raise the height of the floor by 6 - 8\". You can kindof see that when you look next to the form wall.\n\n<center>https://s17.postimg.org/xbremtqz3/IMG_20160909_160203.jpg</center>\n\nThe rectangle area on the right side of the photo below is where the fire pit will be built. That is basically the size of the stainless steel cooking pan. After the concrete sets the moisture barrier and the gravel under it will be removed to make room for the firebrick that will line the inside of the pit. The guys just got back last night from the trip to Tennesee to pick up the tray from the fabricator. I wasn't able to snag a pic of that just yet but I promise it will be in my next update.\n\n<center>https://s13.postimg.org/9wlacfzfb/IMG_20160909_160253.jpg</center>\n\nThe following pics show the ditches that were dug for the water and sewer lines. In the last one you can see the drain, and the pipe going to it is along the left side of the foundation. There are 2 large pipes sticking up about 18 inches for air vents or clean out access, also on left side of the knee wall / foundation. If you look close you can see the water supply line protruding through the knee wall below ground level, and sticking straight up in the air about 4 feet tall just inside the foundation wall.\n\n<center>https://s11.postimg.org/z4nlogoqr/IMG_20160909_160342.jpg</center>\n\n<center>https://s12.postimg.org/7jru2pcfx/IMG_20160909_160436.jpg</center>\n\n<center>https://s12.postimg.org/qddmzpanx/IMG_20160909_160403.jpg</center>\n\nHere is a pic from the south side looking towards the road. From this you can see how high the floor will be and how much gravel it took to get the height needed so the drain would flow properly.\n\n<center>https://s4.postimg.org/sco9yf2ul/IMG_20160909_160535.jpg</center>\n\nAlright! Now the fun begins - pouring the concrete!\n\n<center>https://s15.postimg.org/x1gwffnuz/temp_3.jpg</center>\n\nThe smoothing process and another view of the water supply line.\n\n<center>https://s15.postimg.org/jjwc08ebf/temp_4.jpg</center>\n\n<center>https://s22.postimg.org/6qyam34up/temp_6.jpg</center>\n\nGetting the last of the concrete put down and leveled out.\n\n<center>https://s14.postimg.org/qjv8tvo9d/temp_7.jpg</center>\n\nAnd the final finishing touches...\n\n<center>https://s14.postimg.org/spma91p69/temp_9.jpg</center>\n\nNot much to add for this update, but as you can see progress is being made! I promise to have some photos of the cook pan on my next update, and possibly a CAD drawing of what the cook shack will look like when it's done. \n\nThanks for your interest, it's greatly appreciated. Please pass a link to this post along to your friends and followers and help us raise the funds necessary to complete this project. There is much to do and we can use all the help we can get, so if you can spare a few bucks please consider donating. [Here's the link to the go fund me campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/27sp5f8). BTW, there was a $100 donation made a day or 2 after I posted the first article, and I believe the donator found us through Steemit. Whoever you are, thanks!!!",

    "body": "He is a model - He is a fashion icon - He is the greatest soccer player but above all a great human being.... He is none other than Cristiano Ronaldo. \n\n  http://i66.tinypic.com/3469wcz.jpg\n<a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/62/22/fa/6222fa447a58ed1ca247cd2845c6341b.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Image Source</a>\n\nEvery single child who loves football wants to become Ronaldo, His style of playing, his artistic work with the ball, his incredible tricks, and amazing speed makes him one of the greatest footballers of all time.\nBorn in 1985 in Funchal Madeira, Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo started playing at a very young age of 12 when he was signed by Sporting CP. In his only second year of playing football, Ronaldo suffered the biggest setback of his life at the age of 14 when he was diagnosed with Tachycardia. Something that could have easily stopped him from playing for the rest of his life, but being a born fighter he underwent a laser operation at a young age and was successfully discharged within few days. He started with his daily training and resumed playing football only two weeks later since then there was no seeing back for this young boy who went from strength to strength.\n\nIn his early years, Ronaldo played in the Spanish Primera Liga where he impressed everyone with his skills, he caught the eye of many soccer fans and big names like Arsene Wenger and Alex Ferguson. But it was the year 2003, that changed Ronaldo's life - at the age of 18 he was signed by Manchester United with the transfer fee of \u00a312.24 million, making him the most expensive teenager in the history of English Premier League. His style of playing was loved by every English man. \nThis was the beginning and there was no looking back after this, In his stay with Manchester United for six years, Cristiano Ronaldo became a hero and a rising superstar. In the year 2009, Ronaldo was signed by Spanish Primera Liga club - Real Madrid for the record transfer fee of \u00a380 million. He justified his deal with scoring a goal in his very first game against Deportivo La Coruna. Ronaldo was always seen a danger man especially when it came to playing against arch rivals Barcelona.\n\nCR7\nEveryone knows Cristiano Ronaldo as CR7, 7 is actually his jersey number for Real Madrid which was handed over to him in 2010 after the exit of Spanish star Raul Gonzalez. This number proved to be a lucky mascot of the Portugal and Real Madrid striker.\n\nhttp://i63.tinypic.com/30hov4j.jpg\n<a href=\"http://www.qqxxzx.com/images/cristiano-ronaldo-wallpaper-hd/cristiano-ronaldo-wallpaper-hd-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Image Source</a>\n\nBallon d'Or\nWhen it comes to receiving awards and trophies, Ronaldo is not the one to sit back and watch. He has been honored thrice in 2008, 2013 and 2014 with FIFA Ballon d'Or - World Player of the year.\n\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/or2rkn.jpg\n<a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1r0YfOkNhJ8/maxresdefault.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Image Source</a>\n\nRECORDS\n\n - Cristiano Ronaldo, fastest to scored 200 goals in Spanish League - La Liga, he achieved this feat in his 178th game.\n\n - Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time leading goal scorer for his club Real Madrid.\n\n - Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time leading goal scorer in UEFA Champions League.\n\n - Cristiano Ronaldo, In the year 2016 he became the first player to score a goal at the four consecutive European Championship finals.\n\n - Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 50 or more goals in a season on six consecutive occasions, thus making him the only footballer in the history of       the game to achieve this feat.\n\n - Cristiano Ronaldo  became the first ever football player from Portugal to play for English Premier League club - Manchester United.\n\n - Cristiano Ronaldo is also the only player to win four Golden shoe awards.\n\nCHARITY\n\nBig Earnings - Big Heart, this is what Cristiano Ronaldo is all about. When it comes to Donations and Charity Ronaldo is the first person to put a step forward. Here are just a few of his great works.\n\n - Cristiano Ronaldo donated \u00a35 million to Nepal earthquake that killed over 8,000 people in 2015.\n\n - Cristianio Ronaldo donated \u00a3105,000 to a cancer hospital.\n\n - Cristiano Ronaldo donated \u00a3275,009 to Kids Cancer Foundation.\n\n - Cristiano Ronaldo donated $83,000 to his young fan for brain surgery.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo not only heads the list of most lovable football players of all time but also heads the list of the most charitable sports person. \nThere are many sports person's who are rich, but Cristiano Ronaldo is rich at heart...... that is why I really love this man.",

I know this is said a great deal, however, why do we give these things a chance to own us? Perhaps it's simple for me to type this on an iPad , sitting in my car. In any case, and still, at the end of the day, If you take me as an example, I am doing just great financially. I don't blow money usually, I don't have a great deal of things I need to buy yet I'll stay bold even if my life flips upside down. So why do I make my upcoming future decisions based on money itself? What is this obsession I have? I'm not able to make sense of that yet.</h3></p>\n<p><center>http://i.giphy.com/C1bxVyf8KAGbK.gif</center></p>\n<center><a href=\"http://i.giphy.com/IT6kBZ1k5oEeI.gif\">Credits</a></center>\n<p><h3>I recently earned my first $$ here,thanks to Steemit. Considering the fact that I'm still a student, it was a quite decent sum. I haven't really withdrawn much of it. I have to get myself another phone soon as this one is broken. Anyway, I don't know how to spend it apart from purchasing a phone for myself. I truly don't. And then I think that I should save it. On the other hand, save money for what? Presumably for what's to come in my future. That is reasonable I presume.</h3></p>\n<p><center>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/imageedit_2_7339449845eb53d.jpg</center></p>\n<center><a href=\"http://www.quotehd.com/imagequotes/authors62/cathy-freeman-cathy-freeman-money-makes-life-easier-but-i-dont-want.jpg\">Credits</a></center>\n<p><h3>What I'm going to say may sound inflated, innocent, idiotic and possibly hypocritical yet I truly hope I never get to be rich. I mean filthy stinking rich. I truly would not joke about this. At any rate in the present situation. I don't know whether this immature opinion of mine will change, later on, however, I truly hope it doesn't. By not having any desire to be rich I don't imply that I want to die out of starvation. I simply would prefer not \"to be a billionaire \" to be my desire in life. Some of the time I take a look at individuals who are ridiculously wealthy and the way they carry on, the way they behave, even if it\u2019s unintentional, it just sort of puts me off. I would prefer not to be that person at any point of my life. Likewise, I'm not showing fingers at billionaires &nbsp;like, say, Bill Gates or Warren Buffet who got to be wonderful at what they do and were rewarded for it. But I bet that they wouldn\u2019t have started out by thinking that they want to just have a ton of money. They started out with confidence in their ideas.</h3></p>\n<p><center>http://i.giphy.com/d3JtCuf3m0S1ReSc.gif</center></p>\n<center><a href=\"http://i.giphy.com/d3JtCuf3m0S1ReSc.gif\">Credits</a></center>\n<p><h3>I've had a few discussions with my few of my friends who say that their objective in life is to \"Have the capacity to bear the cost of each and everything on the planet. From Cars to cruises\". I'm talking about these kind of individuals. I really do not want to turn out to be that kind of a person. These individuals are so weak. I can't see how an individual can think that way. Also, I don't intend to say that one shouldn't gain cash. Money is crucial to surviving and perhaps a couple of perks from time to time. Be that as it may, I would prefer not to toss cash around at each and everything that I see in my life. Once again, I'm pushing on the way that I'm not against cash, I'm against the idea of needing to possess each and everything.YOU get what I am trying to convey right? For instance, I may grow old and have enough cash to purchase a super car with fancy interiors, however, none of that is ever truly going to compare with the 15-year-old, in part separated hatchback, my better half and I drove around during college. See once more, cash is likewise required to purchase that hatchback, however, it doesn't make you a shitty individual. But mate, if you\u2019re buying a car worth millions of dollars, you are so totally an asshole. No amount of advertisements and branding can change that.</h3></p><br>\n<p><center>http://i.giphy.com/2lxG3ySjtbpBe.gif</center></p>\n<center><a href=\"http://i.giphy.com/2lxG3ySjtbpBe.gif\">Credits</a></center>\n<p><h3>What I'm attempting to say is that I'm making a decent attempt to split far from this entire thought of gaining cash to wind up rich. I\u2019m going to try to be great at my job and content at whatever little family money I can use to support me. I realize that I'm fortunate to have a small amount of family cash to support me, however, I know I'm simply lucky. I truly would prefer not to claim a palace or a supercar. I'm not attempting to sound cool. I'm trying to say that is all you need in life and that should be socialistic normalcy, then I\u2019d rather sound like a pretentious hippie than a gutless asshole. I know the first thing popping in a ton of your brains at this moment would be that I'm stating this as a result of bad mouthing.If that\u2019s your opinion, Fuck You mate.</h3></p>\n<p><center>http://i.giphy.com/5XNEIKcohVG8w.gif</center></p>\n<p><center>http://i.giphy.com/P0qVAld5tgupa.gif</center></p>\n<center><a href=\"http://i.giphy.com/5XNEIKcohVG8w.gif\">Credits</a></center>\n<hr>\n<p><h2>Follow and Up Vote <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@alwayzgame\">@alwayzgame</a></h2></p>\n<p><h2>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/04/9995162001848030509161a22f.png</h2></p>\n</html>",

    "body": ">Today I told my dad the final date of my marriage: October 2nd . Few days ago, as I told him that I was going to get married in a few weeks, he got mad at me. \u201cI was expecting you to get a real job before you got married!\u201d was his main critique. \u201cHow can you get married *now*?\u201d he asked me.\n\nOggi ho detto a mio padre la data definitiva del mio matrimonio: due ottobre. Pochi giorni fa, quando gli ho detto che mi sarei sposato nel giro di poche settimane, si \u00e8 arrabbiato con me. \u201cMi sarei aspettato che ti trovassi un lavoro vero prima di sposarti\u201d \u00e8 stato il suo principale oggetto di critica. \u201cCome puoi sposarti *adesso*?\u201d mi ha chiesto.\n\n>Let me give you some background. I\u2019m 29 years old and I want to do many things in my life. I studied economics, worked for no-profit and academia and I published a book in May on the shifting economic paradigm. I dedicated the last year to this book, spent all the savings I had and by now I have a few weeks of financial autonomy left. Meanwhile I rented a room on Airbnb, learned how to do bracelets and sold them on the Ligurian (North-West Italy) seaside. Simultaneously, I\u2019m working on becoming what I call a cryptofarmer: in fact, my goal is to write and earn cryptocurrencies while living in the countryside in a small house I\u2019m transforming into a farm. I learned how to plant a vegetable garden, how to chop wood and limiting the expenses of food and heating.\nEven if sometimes I\u2019m scared I could not afford a living, I feeI I can make it. We can make it. In fact, few months ago a girl I met last winter in Chile joined me and is providing great help with her skills and work. And I\u2019m going to marry her in a few weeks, as I said.\n\nFacciamo un passo indietro. Ho 29 anni e voglio fare tante cose nella mia vita. Ho studiato economia, lavorato nel no-profit e nel mondo accademico per poi pubblicare, a maggio di quest\u2019anno, un libro sul cambio di paradigma in economia. Ho dedicato l\u2019ultimo anno a questo libro, ho speso tutti i miei risparmi e ho davanti ancora qualche settimana di autonomia finanziaria. Nel frattempo ho affittato una stanza su Airbnb e imparato a fare braccialetti che ho venduto sulla costa ligure. Parallelamente lavoro per diventare quello che chiamo un cryptofarmer; il mio obiettivo \u00e8 infatti quello di scrivere e guadagnare cripto-valute mentre vivo in una piccola casa di campagna che sto trasformando in fattoria. Ho imparato come piantare un orto, spaccare la legna e limitare le spese di cibo e riscaldamento.\nAnche se a volte ho paura di non riuscire a guadagnarmi da vivere, sento che ce la posso fare. Che ce la *possiamo* fare. Qualche mese fa, infatti, una ragazza che ho conosciuto lo scorso inverno in Cile si \u00e8 unita ai miei progetti e mi sta dando un grosso aiuto con le sue capacit\u00e0 e il suo lavoro. E io la sposer\u00f2 in qualche settimana, come dicevo.\n>My father is 69 years old. Oddly enough, he actually left countryside for the city \u2013 a choice diametrically opposite to the one I made \u2013 to become a lawyer and had success by working really hard. As far as I know, he wanted to be a journalist but chose to be a lawyer to get a better salary \u2013 as he got. He wanted me to be a lawyer too, of course, but when I chose to study economics he told me I could become an auditor; those were professions, in his words, that paid good.\n\nMio padre ha 69 anni. E\u2019 curioso come lui lasci\u00f2 la campagna per la citt\u00e0 \u2013 una scelta diametralmente opposta a quella che ho fatto io \u2013 per diventare un avvocato e l\u00ec ha avuto successo lavorando molto. Da quel che so, lui voleva fare il giornalista da giovane, ma poi ha scelto di fare l\u2019avvocato per avere un miglior salario \u2013 come appunto si \u00e8 verificato. Chiaramente voleva che anche io facessi l\u2019avvocato e successivamente, quando io scelsi di studiare economia, mi disse che potevo diventare il revisore contabile; mestieri, questi, che secondo lui erano ben remunerati. \n>Dear dad,\nA couple of years ago, you told that you were eventually glad I didn\u2019t follow your path and became a lawyer. The job had changed too much, you said. Now too many lawyers are fighting one against each other to get the job and clients are not paying for the work you did for them. That\u2019s how you described me your job \u2013 a job that in Italy, for your generation, was a synonym of success. A son who became a lawyer was a dream for the average family.\nWell, I\u2019m going to add a little piece to this picture. In a few decades, the whole profession of lawyer may become obsolete. Do you know that even today you can ask legal question to [Ross](http://www.psfk.com/2015/01/ross-ibm-watson-powered-lawyer-legal-research.html), an IBM powered machine? It will provide you an answer by sifting through thousands of legal documents, statutes and cases - assisting you to get ready for the case by including citations, suggested readings and confidence ratings. \nToday few technologies are ready to disrupt whole sectors of the economy. One of these is Artificial Intelligence that could make your profession obsolete. Another is the blockchain: that one could make the auditor and accountancy profession useless too. Have you ever heard about it? Some say it\u2019s important as the invention of the Internet.\n\nCaro pap\u00e0,\nQualche anno fa mi hai detto che in fin dei conti eri contento che non avessi seguito la tua strada e fossi diventato un avvocato. Il lavoro \u00e8 cambiato troppo, hai detto. Troppi avvocati in conflitto l\u2019uno contro l\u2019altro per accaparrarsi clienti che poi non pagano il lavoro che fai per loro. Cos\u00ec mi hai descritto il tuo lavoro \u2013 un lavoro che in Italia, per la tua generazione, era sinonimo di successo. Un figlio che diventava avvocato era un sogno per la famiglia media.\nBeh, lasciami aggiungere un pezzo a questa storia. In un paio di decadi, la professione stessa dell\u2019avvocato potrebbe diventare obsoleta. Sai che gi\u00e0 oggi puoi chiedere un parere legale a [Ross](http://www.psfk.com/2015/01/ross-ibm-watson-powered-lawyer-legal-research.html), una macchina sviluppata da IBM? Ti restituisce una risposta setacciando migliaia di documenti legali, statuti e casi \u2013 assistendoti a prepararti al caso includendo citazioni, letture consigliate e intervalli di confidenza. Alcune tecnologie sono sul punto di rivoluzionare interi settori dell\u2019economia. Una di queste \u00e8 l\u2019intelligenza artificiale che potrebbe rendere obsoleta la tua professione. Un\u2019altra \u00e8 la blockchain: questa potrebbe rendere inutile la professione del contabile e del revisore. Ne hai mai sentito parlare? Alcuni dicono che \u00e8 importante quanto l\u2019invenzione di Internet.\n>**You should really be glad I didn\u2019t choose your job just because it paid good**. As I was 18 (in 2005) being a lawyer paid good, in a decade it wasn\u2019t the case anymore. **In fact, between 2007 and 2014 the average income reported by Italian lawyers [declined from 51.314 euro to 37.505]( http://www.italiaoggi.it/news/dettaglio_news.asp?id=201603102026358478&chkAgenzie=ITALIAOGGI&titolo=Avvocati,%20redditi%20da%20dimenticare)**. Well, last decade  \u2013 it is to be said - was a *century*: while economy collapsed in one of the worst crisis ever, technology produced unparalleled innovations. Before 2005 there was no Youtube. In 2005 there was no smartphone either. No-one can tell what are we going to see in the next decade. Some say there will be some big change in the workplace. In fact, [some researchers at Oxford]( http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) say that by 2035, half of the jobs Americans currently hold will be automatized. **Robots are simply better than men in doing robotic work**. Even the world\u2019s most ancient profession may suffer a strong decline with the development of virtual reality \u2013 this has become the next big thing in adult entertainment.\n\n**Devi essere davvero contento che non abbia scelto il tuo lavoro solo perch\u00e9 era ben remunerato**. Quando ancora io avevo 18 anni (nel 2005) fare l\u2019avvocato era remunerativo, ma nell\u2019arco di un decennio ci\u00f2 non era pi\u00f9 vero. **Tra il 2007 e il 2014 il reddito medio dell\u2019avvocato italiano [\u00e8 sceso da 51.314 euro a 37.505 euro]( http://www.italiaoggi.it/news/dettaglio_news.asp?id=201603102026358478&chkAgenzie=ITALIAOGGI&titolo=Avvocati,%20redditi%20da%20dimenticare)**. L\u2019ultimo decennio \u2013 bisogna riconoscerlo - ha rappresentato un *secolo*: mentre l\u2019economia collassava in una delle peggiori crisi di sempre, la tecnologia produceva innovazioni senza pari. Prima del 2005 non c\u2019era Youtube. Prima del 2005 non c\u2019era nemmeno lo smartphone. Nessuno pu\u00f2 dire cosa vedremo nel prossimo decennio. Molti dicono che ci saranno grossi cambiamenti sul luogo di lavoro. [Alcuni ricercatori di Oxford]( http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) dicono che entro il 2035, il 45% dei lavori attualmente svolti dagli americani verr\u00e0 automatizzato. **I robot svolgono meglio degli uomini i lavori da robot**. Perfino il mestiere pi\u00f9 vecchio del mondo potrebbe risentire di un forte declino a seguito dello sviluppo della realt\u00e0 virtuale \u2013 questa \u00e8 diventata l\u2019ultima novit\u00e0 nel mondo dell\u2019intrattenimento per adulti.\n>Don\u2019t worry, dad, and don\u2019t look at me as someone who is living hand to mouth. Many things are changing in the next years, together with most of the reference points we had. Those jobs who were good, could not be profitable and stable anymore. Most of all, the same idea of stability will change: we\u2019ll have to find stability surfing between waves of change. Choosing a job just because it pays good today, may not be a good strategy. **My generation is challenged to find and develop that personal value, those talents, that no machine could substitute. This is what I\u2019m doing \u2013 soon I\u2019ll write you how**.\n\nPer questo, pap\u00e0, non preoccuparti e non guardarmi come si guarda un figlio che vive di espedienti. Molte cose cambieranno nei prossimi anni, insieme a molti dei punti di riferimento che avevamo. Quei lavori che prima erano buoni, potrebbero non essere pi\u00f9 remunerativi e stabili. Pi\u00f9 di tutto, cambier\u00e0 l\u2019idea di stabilit\u00e0: dovremmo imparare a trovare la stabilit\u00e0 di un surfista a cavallo di ondate di cambiamento. Scegliere un lavoro solo perch\u00e9 paga bene oggi, potrebbe non essere una strategia che paga. **La sfida per la mia generazione \u00e8 di trovare e sviluppare quel  valore personale, quei talenti, che nessuna macchina pu\u00f2 sostituire. Questo \u00e8 quello che sto facendo io \u2013 presto ti scriver\u00f2 come**.\n\nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/2hz9lz.jpg \n\n*Me, dad, fianc\u00e9, mum*\n\n***Don't forget to follow @cryptofarmer***\n***a shout out goes to @claudiop63 for assisting the Italian community so don't forget to follow him***",

The reason for this was discovered by Galileo: **the square-cube law**. The failure of scale symmetry is due to the physics of atoms, which have a de\ufb01nite size. This determines the properties of materials and sets a fundamental scale for the universe. \n\n-------------------------\n\n\n# Exploring the symmetry of scale instead of  re\ufb02ecting the world, we magnify it and ask whether large objects  behave the same way as small objects in our universe. \n\n<center>![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/xQVZUHC.png)</center>\n<center>wikipedia</center>\n\n**The square-cube law**, describing how size affects the physical properties of objects, was \ufb01rst discovered by Galileo Galilei and published in his book Two New Sciences. The second \u201cnew science\u201d concerned strength of structures. Galileo noticed a difference between the basic designs of small and large animals\u2014not just in size but in proportion. He realized the strength of an object is proportional to cross-sectional area, whereas its weight is proportional to volume. \n\n\n-----------------------------\n\n# Area and volume depend on size in different ways, so the relation of strength to weight is different for objects of different size. ; \n\n<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Comparison_of_surface_area_vs_volume_of_shapes.svg/330px-Comparison_of_surface_area_vs_volume_of_shapes.svg.png</center>\n<center>wikipedia</center>\n\n* Area is a square (x\u00b2), \n* Volume is cubic (x\u00b3). \n\n-------------------------\n\n ## For example imagine magnifying an animal 100x: \n\n**Original Animal**\n* Mass of 100 kg and  footprint of 100 cm\u00b2 \n* Supporting its weight at 1 kg / cm\u00b2\n\n**100x Magnified Animal**\n* Mass of 1,000,000,000 kg and  footprint of 1,000,000 cm\u00b2\n* It would now have to support 1000 kg / cm\u00b2 \n* 1000x the weight per unit area.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n# This explains why science \ufb01ction concepts like giant mutant ants are impossible: Their structures (areas) cannot support their weight (volumes). \n\n\n<center>http://www.bluebird-electric.net/artificial_intelligence_autonomous_robotics/insectronics_robotics_pictures_animatronic_soldiers/ant_movies_insecta_saurus_giant_attacking_charley_temple.jpg</center>\n<center>[giant ants](>http://www.bluebird-electric.net/artificial_intelligence_autonomous_robotics/insectronics_robotics_pictures_animatronic_soldiers/ant_movies_insecta_saurus_giant_attacking_charley_temple.jpg)</center>\n\n**We also see this in real life.** \n\n1. Larger animals lead more sedate lifestyles than smaller ones.\n2. They are structurally more delicate. \n3. Larger animals have thicker proportions. \n4. Compare the legs of an elephant to those of an ant.\n5. Larger animals have lower metabolic rates than smaller ones, using fuel more ef\ufb01ciently. \n\n---------------------\n\n# **The square-cube law** is a general principle of physics. It applies to any structure, not just living things. \n\n<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Coal_anthracite.jpg</center>\n<center>wikipedia</center>\n\n* A lump of coal burns at a moderate rate, but coal dust suspended in air can cause an explosion. The greater surface area of the dust allows greater combination with oxygen from the air and a greater release of energy. \n* The interior of Earth is as hot as the Sun\u2019s surface due to radioactive decay of potassium-40. A single Earth rock containing potassium-40 cannot heat itself very well, but the surface-to-volume proportions of Earth are so much larger, it creates a tremendous amount of heat with the same percentage of potassium-40. \n\n-------------------------\n\n# Because of **the square-cube law**, magni\ufb01cation is not a symmetry of nature. \n\n<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Helium_atom_QM.svg/450px-Helium_atom_QM.svg.png</center>\n<center>wikipedia</center>\n\nWhy does nature work this way? Two objects, one large and one small, made of the same materials behave in different ways because they are made of the same material, not in spite of it. If you create giant ant, you can not build it out of giant atoms;  atoms of each element have a de\ufb01nite, absolute size. What determines the size of an atom and sets the size scale of the universe? Quantum physics. \n\n\n------------------------------\n\n# Fun Facts:\n \nNear the end of the science \ufb01ction novel and \ufb01lm The Incredible Shrinking Man, the titular man is the size of an insect. Such a man would face physiological problems making cellular chemistry, fluid transfer, gas exchange, and staying alive impossible. \n\n<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/IncredibleShrinkingMan-poster.jpg/330px-IncredibleShrinkingMan-poster.jpg</center>\n<center>wikipedia</center>\n\n\n\nThe light from the Sun exerts a very small pressure on objects in our solar system. This force pushes tiny dust grains entirely out of the solar system and may cause small long-term changes in the orbits of small asteroids but is completely negligible for big planets.  This directly caused by the difference in surface area vs mass on these bodies.\n\n<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Comet_Hale-Bopp_1995O1.jpg/330px-Comet_Hale-Bopp_1995O1.jpg</center>\n<center>wikipedia</center>\n\n \n\n\n-----------------------------------\n-----------------------------------",

A little bit art history is here, as Killarney National park Canada\u2019s most famous painters, The Group of Seven, are said to have been responsible for the creation of Killarney. Once you visit, you quickly understand their passion. This is an enchanted region, with bright white quartzite hills contrasted sharply by wind swept green pines, red granite shorelines and the emerald waters of Georgian Bay.\n\n \n\n![painting](http://trueart.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7copy.jpg)\n# It's very beautiful place to paint on the shore of Georgian Bay.\n![shore](http://trueart.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8copy.jpg)\n\n# One of my painting is drying, well it's oil.\n\n**Thank you very much for checking my work.

Isn't she a beauty?\n\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/80bc2d561d6b165be7ad8630f1f43051.png\n\n## Stage 1:\n Modeling foam, glued together or stack it with some toothpicks like I did. \nMaking my initial shape with a knife, I am keep working till I get a shape I can work with.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/falainitsastage15f666.jpg\n\n## Stage 2\n\nApplying clay over the modeling foam. The clay must be treated with water, work it out in your hands to soften it then apply it over your model, do not make it thinner than 1 mm as it will crack while it dries out.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/8912ae9b97d2bcd581aadefb82e7ea1d.jpg\n\n## Stage 3\n\nRefining and creating details, use a sharp tool to sharpen the surface of your model. Use some water to clean up your tools every now and then, it helps the most when you are working with clay to have clean and wet tools to work out.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/falainitsastage294837.jpg\n\n## Stage 4\n\nCuring process. Allow your clay model to complete dry out. It will take approximately 24 hours for this procedure to occur.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/falainitsastage35b415.jpg\n\n## Stage 5\n\nPainting your model. I used casual temperas colors, you can use acrylics or sprays. It all comes down to what you are aiming for as an end result so it is a matter of preference. Congrats your sculpture is ready it is time for some photo shooting.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/final3cab50.jpg\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/final25f3cb.jpg\n\nI hope you like the end result.\nI sure did. It now decorates a shelf on my bedroom I will call her the Ocean Pearl I was going for Marianda but she is simple not fat enough for that...\n@ned @dan @smooth @berniesanders @blocktrades @itsascam @andeverywhale out thereI hope you get a giggle out of this. I have made this as mean to go to the Amsterdam steemfest and get some of my fellows with him. Please enjoy.\n\n\nThank you all for your support\nI will include some high res photos for you to check out the final sculpture\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/c6049e3fffe58f0a25d8c9b9433fbdb1.png\n\nFollow me \n@skapaneas",

At the end of the Ice Age occurred after the earthquake the mountains and the sea has disappeared, leaving the lake.</strong> &nbsp;</h2>\n<blockquote>\u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u044f \u043e\u0442\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044e. \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0439, \u043c\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u0432\u043e\u0437\u044c \u0441\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0441 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443 \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0443 (\u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0430 400 \u043c \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0440\u044f). \u0418\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0441\u044e\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440. \u0421\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u2013 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u043e \u0411\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435, \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u2013 \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u0427\u0435\u0431\u0430\u0447\u044c\u0435. \u0423\u0437\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u043e\u0442 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430. \u041c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435. \u0412 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u044d\u043f\u043e\u0445\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043b\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044b, \u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0447\u0435\u0437\u043b\u043e, \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0432 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430. &nbsp;</blockquote>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<p>https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14359259_152799475167975_98603255398361972_n.jpg?oh=7b83e27871bfc6f510e974824845ffae&amp;oe=587D0CB9</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14264902_152799531834636_3309893395448978116_n.jpg?oh=da6935b1e00c6d9e4831a001aa355d4b&amp;oe=5878E28F</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14355113_152799521834637_6431813635807103091_n.jpg?oh=586833de4b32c0a4e68a4de0f0685fdc&amp;oe=583C7EAD</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>From the observation deck offers breathtaking scenic views of the Blue Bay Lake Borovoye.

    "body": "Eight years have passed since we encountered the severe financial crisis that badly shook our economy. Back in 2008, we witnessed some of the most tiresome times for the financial markets. The last time something close to that had occurred, or even worse, was in the 1930s when the Great Depression had hit our economy. However, the economy has settled now from the adverse effects of the 2008 crisis and is behaving in a more normal manner, but what if those economic nightmares happened again? Are we prepared enough for that? Here are a few important lessons that everyone should learn from the economic crisis of 2008.\n\n1. Prepare yourself for the unexpected\nYou might have heard the saying that you should always expect the unexpected. Surely, you will never know what tomorrow may bring. You should always be ready for the uncertain events that might occur anytime. The financial markets might be stable today, but they can become unstable tomorrow. So it is essential for you to take some steps to prepare yourself.\n\n2. Don\u2019t entirely believe in the good face of the market\nDo you see too much good around you? Is there a constant rise in markets? Are loans available to everyone easily? Are interest rates continually lower than expected? You should watch out if anything like that happens. Always remember that too much good is never good for anyone. These conditions only create a false sense of security. People take more loans because of the lower interest rates and when things get back to normal, it causes a crisis.\n\n3. Always invest for long-term gains\nIf you want to live tension-free when the next financial crisis occurs, it is crucial that you start investing for long-term gains rather than short-term ones. These short-term gains might appear tempting, but they won't help you at all in the long run and not even in an economic crisis. You might not know this, but short-term investments increase the possibility of illiquidity when you need the cash, leaving you empty-handed.\n\n4. Experts know a lot but not everything\nIf you blindly believe what experts say, you might not be able to survive the crisis. We put our trust in the experts whether they were economists, stock analysts, fund managers, accounting firms, the government, industry regulators, CEOs, and what happened? They disappointed us. Not all, but surely some of them lied to us and knowingly deceived us for their personal gain and greed. The crisis of 2008 has clearly demonstrated that even the geniuses of our economy fail too. Undoubtedly, this is the best lesson from the past crises. We should not blindly trust the professionals as their predictions can be wrong and misleading.\n\n5. Make your investment approach flexible\nWhen a crisis hits, opportunities can come in various ways which you might have no idea about. This is why it's important that you have a flexible investment approach. Never get too attached to a single",

    "body": "<html>\n<blockquote>TL;DR: <br>\nIf you're like me: a software engineer, who's been writing code for many years and attends lots of startup events, then you've been asked over a hundred times, by someone you've just met, to be their co-founder. And you've met even more people who want you to build their app for free and then they'll pay you when it gets big and it starts making money. To be honest, whenever I meet someone in the second category, I don't know if I should laugh or cry - I don't think I'll ever be able to help them. But in this article, I'd like to help people in the first category. Oh &amp; BTW: with 2 failed startups and one that's doing great under my belt, I'm speaking from experience.</blockquote>\n<p>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bp7sQtPCMAECFrL.jpg</p>\n<p><strong>1. Pick someone you\u2019ve been friends with for years</strong><br>\nThe reason you want to start your company with the person you drink beer with on evenings on weekdays, play with her kids on weekends or eat supper at his house when there\u2019s a power-cut at yours (these are not is because starting a company is hard: there are going to be times when it makes sense to quit or times when you disagree on things that are very important to you (and not her). <br>\nIf you have some history/relationship, there\u2019s going to be a lot more to lose when you disappoint your co-founder or when you quit. That history/relationship alone will be enough reason to keep going during the tough times.<br>\nSecondly, you will have more time to work together to get more stuff done. Because you already have beers together until late at night and spend all weekend together you don\u2019t have wait until Monday morning to discuss an important decision.<br>\nThirdly, you\u2019re going to likely need your co-founders help when things get bad in your personal life (because you spend most of your time with them) and it helps if she understands. These bad situations are unique for everyone of course and they could be anything from having a landlord who is trying to kick you out because your rent is late again or the death of a close family member.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Pick someone who sees things differently from you</strong><br>\nHaving a co-founder who did the same degree as you do, who drinks the same beer that you drink and agrees with everything you say won\u2019t help you as much as you as much as having a cofounder who challenges you, who thinks of things you didn\u2019t. A co-founder who is exactly like you wont\u2019 help you grow personally.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Pick someone who doesn\u2019t mind working with people who see things differently.</strong> <br>\nI consider this as one of the best lessons I learnt from my co-founder. We have a friend (actually, she\u2019s just someone we know) we keep going to for advice because she has a lot of experience in our industry. I never really looked forward to those meetings because every time, she was not-only patronising but she always finds something to criticise. There was a point when I realised that my co-founder didn\u2019t mind listening to her talk. When she started talking, he was not only attentive but seemed to have some \u2018<em>inner-peace</em>\u2019. One day I asked him why and he told me that he \u201c<em>actually preferred being around people who were very different from him</em>\u201d because he could \u201c<em>learn most from people like that than those who were not</em>\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Pick someone who is as passionate about the problem you\u2019re solving as you are.</strong><br>\nIf your startup is going to be the next best thing, everyone else is going to think you\u2019re crazy when you\u2019re geeking out about how well the technology you\u2019re building solves X. Don\u2019t start your company with non-believers. When the going starts getting tough (and it will) they will have a bunch of reasons why this was a bad idea to start with.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Someone who believes in you</strong><br>\nIf she doesn\u2019t believe in you, she is going to micromanage you and second-guess your every move. There are some things you can do to get your co-founder to believe in you more:<br>\n- be good at something. And learn to do it better than anyone else in the world<br>\n- avoid doing the things you\u2019re not very good at - learn to delegate.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Someone you believe in</strong><br>\nThis is another reason you should get a co-founder who is way better that yo are at something. No matter how good you are, you can\u2019t do everything yourself; you\u2019re going to have to delegate. It\u2019s harder to delegate to someone if you can do the job better than they can.<br>\nThat\u2019s also (one of) the reason why you want to hire people who are smarter than you are - it\u2019s easier to delegate stuff to them and you get more done. You should strive to make yourself obsolete by finding and hiring people who are better at what you do than you are. And then delegating everything to them.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Don\u2019t listen to me or anyone</strong><br>\nYou\u2019re an entrepreneur, follow your gut and do whatever you want. Don\u2019t listen to other people\u2019s advice. Nobody knows what the hell the are doing. Don\u2019t believe me, watch this:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sycgL3Qg_Ak</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>WILL NEXT-GEN CIVILIZATIONS BEGIN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/mbai68c0x/image.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"393\"/></p>\n<p>(Thanks to ndtv.com for image)</p>\n<p>INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p>The fishermen of the Indian state of Kerala had a big &nbsp;problem, prior to 2001. It was this: The fish they caught were intended to be sold at market, but the only way they had of finding out if they had a buyer was to go to a market and engage in face to face communication. If the market they went to had no need of their fish, they would not be able to visit another, because the markets were about ten miles apart, the fish were perishable and the markets closed at 8AM. Choose the wrong buyer, and the whole catch would have to be thrown back into the sea. Economists call this a \u2018coordination problem\u2019.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But then these workers got hold of technology familiar to us all that matched buyers and sellers much more effectively. They got themselves mobile phones. Now, while they were still out at sea, they could phone ahead and arrange the best deal for their catch.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Now, I am not really interested in fish, but rather the fact that these workers made the jump from what was essentially stoneage communications to 21st century communications. What if developing countries can achieve a similar leap forward with agriculture, banking, education, energy, money and civil engineering and so on? If so, what they might develop into would be a new kind of civilization. Some people, for instance Marshall Brain, call this a \u20184th generation civilization\u2019. But, since I am unsure as to how many civilizations there have been, I will play safe and call it a next-generation civilization.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>NEXT-GENERATION CIVILIZATION</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.postimg.org/3kwz8pw0z/image.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"/></p>\n<p>(Thanks to wallpapercave.com for image)</p>\n<p>So what is this next-generation civilization? I see it as being a civilization that uses the only resources we have- natural capital and human potential- with maximum efficiency. Because it has achieved this, it has eliminated- as far as is physically possible- the obstacles to greater social cohesion and personal development. Citizens of next-generation civilization would find themselves much further up Maslow\u2019s famous pyramid of the hierarchy of needs than is the case for all but a few of the nations\u2019 population today. This would make next-generation civilizations the best platform we have ever had for realizing the transhuman pursuit of social and individual excellence.</p>\n<p>WHY THERE?</p>\n<p>If we acknowledge that a next-generation civilization could be achieved, why should we suppose it would emerge in developing countries? In many ways, these are places that have barely reached the 20th century. Dreaming up some glitzy, high-tech civilization sounds like an undertaking for people of affluent countries with plenty of time on their hands, not something that would concern those struggling to get by on one or two dollars per day. And then there is the matter of corruption. Stories abound of the terrible misallocation of wealth that goes on in the world\u2019s poorest countries. The African Union estimated that some 25% of its annual GDP is lost to corruption. As they are so far behind, and the corrupt and criminal tend to thwart dreams of a better life, why look to such countries for the rise of NGC?</p>\n<p>ADVANTAGES</p>\n<p>We should not think that developing nations have no advantages. There is, for example, the \u2018latecomer\u2019s advantage\u2019. There is no rule that says a country has to retread all the steps that lead to the modern world. They can leapfrog straight to the latest technologies and practices. Indeed, this leapfrogging makes a great deal of sense, because the most modern technologies often do the same job as predecessors, only more cost effectively and less wastefully. The cost of purchasing and burying copper wire for a communications infrastructure would be more than $100 million. Cell tower infrastructure would cost a relatively small tens of thousands of dollars. If a city like Zinder in South Niger were to adopt PCs, then by the time 10% of the population were using them, the power they consume- 1,500 KW- would exceed that of all households today. Mobile devices, on the other hand, would consume just 74KWs, and as they run off of batteries they would be more useful in areas where power outage is a common experience. It is for reasons such as these that countries like El Salvdore and Panama have adopted mobile communications faster than the USA.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The fact that the rich nations have well-established systems and infrastructures could be an impediment to progress. W. Brian Arthur, External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and author of \u2018The Nature of Technology\u2019 has written about how established technologies and practices can delay the adoption of new methods, even though those new methods are superior. In 1955, the economist Marvin Frankel noticed that cotton mills in Lancashire were not using the more modern and efficient machinery. This was because the old brick structures that housed the old machinery would have to be torn down before the new machinery could be installed. As Arthur wrote, \u201cThe outer assemblies thus locked in the inner machinery and thus the Lancashire mills did not change\u201d. To this day, whenever a technology is so interwoven with the fabric of everyday life or business practice that replacing it seems too much bother, we say it has become \u2018locked-in\u2019.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/9s4bde9wz/image.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"457\"/></p>\n<p>(thanks to Wikipedia.org for image)</p>\n<p>ATTITUDES</p>\n<p>There is also a psychological aspect to consider. Established technologies and practices can lead people to adopting certain ways of doing things, and upstart technologies that obsolete the old ways can be threatening. Sociologist Diane Vaughan called this \u2018Psychological Dissonance\u2019 and wrote:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>\u201c(We use) a frame of reference constructed from integrated sets of assumptions, expectations, and experiences\u2026This frame of reference is not easily altered or dismantled, because the way we tend to see the world is intimately linked to how we see and define ourselves in relation to the world. Thus, we have a vested interest in maintaining consistency because our own identity is at risk\u201d.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Therefore, established technologies, infrastructures and methods can create hysteresis- a delayed response to change- that holds the new at bay, at least until the old ways simply cannot be stretched any further. So, it could be that developing countries which lack many of these established infrastructures and technologies, would adopt the new and accommodate themselves more quickly to the methods and practices they make possible.</p>\n<p>CORRUPTION</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/voz978hk9/image.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"616\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>(Thanks to thefifthcolumnnews.com for image)</p>\n<p>As for the problem of corruption, we should not think that it only goes on in the poor nations of the world. The reason why the corruption that goes on there seems so overt and in-your-face may be because it is immature. In the West, centuries of adjustments and fine-tuning have evolved institutions that divert real wealth from those who create it to those who set the rules. As world-renowned linguist and social philosopher Noam Chomsky pointed out, using violence in order to get people to obey, as the Soviet Union did, will ultimately fail. What is needed are systems of indoctrination to ensure that citizens agree to what the ruling class want. This can be achieved by, among other things, entering the school system and educating the nation\u2019s future workforce towards the \u2018correct\u2019 way of thinking (one third of textbooks in American schools are provided by corporations) and censoring material that questions state dogma (a study by Vincent Navarro of John Hopkins University that found a correlation between class and race and wealth inequality was refused publication by every major medical journal in the US). These and other insidious practices successfully hide much of the elite wealth appropriation that goes on from view. It would be no mean feat to successfully un-entangle those immoral methods of wealth creation from the beneficial forms that is vital for any successful civilization.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But much of the corruption in developing countries will be relatively easy to deal with. Much of it consists of plain old bribery, for instance having to pay your boss before he will hand over your wages. If you were working online for a foreign company and your wages were wired directly into your account, that form of corruption would be much reduced. Moving to a cashless society using mobile devices that recognize their rightful owner and refuse to work for unauthorized users- say by using biometrics to identify users- would leave folks less vulnerable to theft. In countries like Niger, Senegal and Uganda, parents may have to pay bribes to get their children into school. With Internet access and availability of free educational resources like Kahn Academy and Granny Cloud (the latter being a service in which retirees voluntarily give some of their time to running lessons over Skype) that form of corruption is rendered obsolete. Many other forms of overt corruption would be harder to get way with in a country where the mass adoption of camera-phones and social networking makes surveillance possible.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Futurists forecast some pretty astonishing technological capabilities becoming available as NBIC (nanotech, biotech, information tech and cognitive science) ride up Kurzweil's curves of exponential progress. It would be a truly great thing if the amazing possibilities of such technologies unlocked the entrepreurial and creative potential of the bottom billion and transformed their lives into a civilization that is the envy of the world.</p>\n</html>",

The Ziff and Alliance fighters had mounted a heroic defense, but the Void Seeds were simply too many and too strong.  The city traps had caused havoc, but the enemy had regrouped and regained the initiative.  Finally, before all was lost, the order was given for everyone to pull back into the desert.  The South was lost.  Transports were in the process of being deployed to collect the survivors.\n\nThe Void Seeds allowed the defenders to disengage and proceeded to swarm all over the three intact cities.  They drained the shield domes rapidly.  As the shields collapsed, the Southern Daxiste-agorian flagship fired two white bone plasma rounds. It was a costly use of their most potent weapon but there was no choice.  The Void Seeds, along with every Southern city, were vapourised.\n   \nThe Alliance could not afford to expend the last plasma rounds.  Sserwellia's Northern cities would have to be saved the hard way.\n    \n********************\nPresent\n********************\n\nAnna\u2019s squads of Hoverflies were proving fairly effective at distracting the Void Seeds on the fringes but they were not inflicting much damage.  The human fighters did not have the strength or speed to match the Void Seed in close combat.  They had already sustained losses which she was finding difficult to bear.\n\nAhead, she saw a squad become embroiled within a mass of Void Seeds.  They were rapidly being ripped from the Hoverflies and torn apart.  \n\n\u201cOn me!\u201d\n\nHer squad crashed into the Void Seeds, pushing them back with several of her fighters using the impact and momentum of the Hoverflies to leap onto the chests of a number of Void Seeds.  They attempted to plunge their white bone weapons into their chests.\n\nSome of the Void Seed went down, their hearts having been successfully speared, but others remained combat effective.  One of her fighters, caught in the grip of a Void Seed, was crushed against it\u2019s chest until his back snapped with a loud crack and blood poured out of his mouth, nose and eyes.  The Void Seed\u2019s trumpeting roar proclaimed it\u2019s victory and then it threw the body into another of her fighters, knocking her from her Hoverfly. \nWithout hesitation, Anna throttled up her Hoverfly and rammed it into the Void Seed.  She tried to leap onto it\u2019s chest but her leg became tangled up and she fell to the ground.  The Void Seed, smashed one of it\u2019s three, misshapen arms into the Hoverfly which crumpled and cracked down the middle.  She looked around and realised that within moments, the two squads would be annihilated. \n\n\u201cPull back!  Pull back!\u201d  She cried.\n\nWhen they saw their commander lying on the ground, a Void Seed bearing down on her, the remaining fighters went into a frenzy, trying desperately to fight their way to her.\n \n\u201cNo!  Pull\u2026..\u201d\n\nThe Void Seed picked her up by one leg and with sickening force, smashed her body into the side of her demolished Hoverfly.\n\n********************\nPresent\n********************\n\nJoshua had never been more filled with rage, but something was changing.  The initial overwhelming fog seemed to be receding.  In it\u2019s place came clarity.  He could think.  The rage was ever-present, powerful.  Yet he could see clearly.\n\nAs he ran towards the Void Seeds, he scanned the ground for white bone.  It wasn\u2019t long before he spotted a something.  He diverted his course towards it and scooped it up.  It appeared to be some kind of large, single edged, white bone katana.  It would do nicely.  He would be more combat effective now.\n\nHe reached the Void Seed and took the heads of the first two as he dove between them.  Two others charged towards him.  He rolled, taking a leg from each, then rammed the katana through each of their backs as they collapsed inwards.\n\nHe looked up and saw some of the human Hoverfly fighters mired in a vicious engagement with the enemy.  He sprinted towards them.  A large Void Seed had a human by the leg.  Before he could reach them, the Void Seed brutally slammed her into the side of a busted Hoverfly.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\nJoshua\u2019s katana took the Void Seed\u2019s arm as it was about to slam her a second time.  Both arm and body flew up into the air.  He spun and rammed the blade into the Void Seed\u2019s heart, spun again and took it\u2019s head.  He caught the body before it landed.\n\nSome of the other humans reached them as Joshua was carefully laying the woman down on the ground.  They formed a perimeter and one of the fighters called for immediate backup.  \n\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d  Joshua asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our commander, Anna.\u201d  Replied the frantic fighter.\n\nJoshua looked down at the woman.  Her injuries appeared to be severe.  Joshua was not a medic but he could see she was going to die very soon.  Her breathing was very shallow.  She had several superficial cuts but the real damage was likely to be internal.\n\nThe other Hoverfly squads had begun arriving, desperate to save their commander.  They loved her.  \nIn that moment, Joshua made a decision.  He took the katana and opened the chest of the Void Seed he\u2019d just killed.  He tore out its heart and brought it to Anna\u2019s prone body.  He ripped several small chunks off with his teeth.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d  Shouted an older fighter grizzled hair.   \n\nGary grabbed Joshua\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the only thing that might save her.\u201d  Joshua replied quietly.\n\nGary looked deeply into Joshua\u2019s eyes.  In that instant, Joshua saw the reflection of his own eyes.  They were white.  Gary\u2019s eyes were full of anguish then acceptance, followed by a grim determination.\n\n\u201cOk.  Do it.\u201d\n\nJoshua began feeding small bits of the Void Seed heart to her, then gently rubbing her throat.  Suddenly she arched back then forwards, her eyes wide and wild.\n\n\u201cMore!\u201d \n\nShe grabbed the heart and began to devour it.  Black matter covered her face, mingling with her blood.\n\n********************\nPresent\n********************\n\nGary looked down at Anna, then at Joshua and back to Anna.  There was no question she had been at death\u2019s door.  He knew it by the terrible throbbing pain in his chest.  When she had reared up and begun devouring the heart, he had almost  jumped for joy.  He didn\u2019t know what was happening, he didn\u2019t care.  He loved Anna and she was alive, she had a chance.  There was only one thing left to do.  Join her in her fate, whatever that may be.\n\n\u201cOur Commander has eaten the heart of a Void Seed.  She is alive.\u201d  \n\nThe fighters all around the perimeter roared their approval.  \n\n\u201cVoid Seed heart just went on the menu. Every man and woman must decide for themselves, but I will follow Anna in her fate.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t hear the response from the human fighters if any.  He struggled to the battle front and attacked the first Void Seed that came within reach.  It swept him up in a massive arm, so he plunged his white bone knife down into it\u2019s wrist.  As he was dropped to the ground, a leg swept out towards him.  He spun to the side so that it missed him, then charged in close.  He stabbed the inside of it\u2019s legs and up into it\u2019s groin.  The Void Seed dropped down and transformed into a something like a bear, flinging him to his back.  The Void Seed\u2019s maw closed upon Gary\u2019s shoulder as he thrust the knife into it\u2019s neck.  The Void Seed reared back and lifted Gary as he clung to the embedded knife.  Then, before he could be dislodged, he rammed the knife deep into it\u2019s chest, over and over.  \nOne of the thrusts must have reach the heart because the Void Seed collapsed onto it\u2019s back.  Without stopping, Gary ripped out the heart and began to devour it.",

Shake the bottle, and watch the glitter swirl around and eventually settle at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It can be used when feeling stressed out or uncomfortable, or if you just want something pretty to look at.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>(Remember to be careful when working with glitter. Don't get it in your eyes, it can cause serious damage if it gets stuck there.)</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>What you need:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Clear plastic bottle (you can use glass, but if it breaks it will be a pain to clean up...)</li>\n  <li>Aleene's Clear Gel Tacky Glue (or similar, the important thing is that it's clear)</li>\n  <li>Extra fine glitter (regular glitter will not settle at the bottom)</li>\n  <li>Glitter glue (optional, if you don't use this, just add a bit more of the clear glue)</li>\n  <li>Super glue (for gluing the lid shut)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>https://s26.postimg.org/ia1dyh1u1/1.jpg</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>How to make it:</h3>\n<p>For one 500 ml bottle (regular sized bottle):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1/3 - 1/2 bottle of the glue (depending on how fast you want the glitter to settle)</li>\n  <li>1 bottle of extra fine glitter (there is no right or wrong amount, I used 20 ml)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Fill the bottle 2/3 full with hot water. Add the glue and the glitter, and also the glitter glue if you have that as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://s26.postimg.org/44vkwnssp/2.jpg</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Close the lid, and shake the bottle until all the glue has dissolved. If you use colder water this will take forever, so remember to use hot water...&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://s26.postimg.org/oqacokadl/3.jpg</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Shake the bottle, and see how long it takes before the glitter settles at the bottom. If it's settling to fast - add more glue! If it's settling to slow, add more water. You will add a bit more water in the end, so it's better that it is a bit too slow than the other way around.</p>\n<p>Sometimes bubbles will form at the top. This will go away after a couple of hours, or you can remove them with a spoon or something like that. When the bubbles are gone, add the rest of the water. Remember to leave a bit of air in the bottle to easier be able to shake it up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://s26.postimg.org/hocf2d6rt/4.jpg</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The last thing you need to do, is superglue the lid shut. Glue and glitter all over your house is not something you would want... So remember this final, but important, step.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>The finished bottles</h1>\n<p>This is what my bottles lookes like when all the glitter is at the bottom.</p>\n<p>https://s26.postimg.org/if5585955/5.jpg</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And when shaken up. The ones I made take around 2-3 minutes to settle.</p>\n<p>https://s26.postimg.org/8w01sfb0p/6.jpg</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

However the quick chat with\nAnderson Cooper was scripted and rehearsed which is why it sounds canned.  \n \nRemember, \"This is CNN.\"\n \nHillary Clinton is in a high-security, secluded and private, intensive care unit with\n4:1 nursing 24/7.  She also has a team of physicians representing practically every\nmedical specialty.   There are no other patients anywhere near her secure care setting.      \n \nShe is dying of Sepsis.

My acquaintances who repeatedly travel abroad advised me to go to one of hot countries and to try diving there.\nSo, here is it, my long-awaited leave, and sky-blue waves and active vacation were already waiting for me.

    "body": "Have you ever looked at famous entrepreneurs and wondered about the secret to their success? You might have heard a lot that people who are highly successful are the ones who are extremely motivated. It is true to some extent but not entirely. Motivation is undoubtedly necessary for everything you do, but what play a significant role in being successful are your actions and habits.\nThat's right, your actions can determine your future. If you are a person whose days are dominated by vigorous and productive practices, you are more likely to get successful. Here are some of the habits that you need to adopt to become a great entrepreneur.\n\n1. Wake Up Early in the Morning\nRising early is one of the most crucial practices that you should embrace to become a great entrepreneur. It is the time when you have clarity of mind and are fully recharged and fresh. Are you saying that you already wake up at eight in the morning? Well, when I say early in the morning, I mean way early. Most of the successful entrepreneurs wake up even before 6 a.m. You might not believe it, but Tim Cook (the CEO of Apple) wakes up at 4:30 a.m. whereas Richard Branson (founder of Virgin Group) at 05:45 a.m.\n\n2. Read as Much as You Can\nReading helps you generate new ideas, augments your ability to focus, expands and boosts your memory, improves and broadens your views, makes you more creative, and motivates you in many different ways. All of those qualities are vital for an entrepreneur. That's why you should read for at least 30 to 60 seconds in the morning or before going to bed. Even Bill Gates, a well-known entrepreneur, is a total book lover. He reads a lot every now and then. He even publishes posts on his website about book recommendations.\n\n3. Take Small but Frequent Breaks\nTaking breaks during your work will make you more energetic and involved. Most of the people who work hard day and night are more likely to get stressed and frantic. If you're thinking that an entrepreneur-in-making should stick to what they are doing and shouldn't take breaks at all, you are wrong. Adequate breaks between your work will make you more productive. It is said that most successful people work for about 60 to 90 minutes and then take a 20-minute break.\n\n4. Keep Looking for Inspiration\nNo matter how successful you are in your life, never stop seeking inspiration. Everyone has to deal with some major hindrances in their life. Sometimes, it becomes hard to overcome them as we suffer a mental roadblock. If this happens to you, you should never lose hope and look for inspiration. The best place to get inspired is watching inspirational videos on TED or reading successful entrepreneur stories or biographies. These things will help you remember to stay on track and keep doing your thing even when things appear bleak.\n\n5. Other Habits to Remember\nSome other practices to remember are to always opt for healthy meals, exercise early in the morning to kick-start your brain and body, set daily goals, follow a plan and take action, stay organized, manage your time effectively, be persistent, and always be grateful.",

    "body": "This is a real story that happened to me and left a very deep impression. This story tells how I became the member of the Russian mafia, what we were doing, and how it all ended... This story is real, some parts of the group are still active that is why some names and places are completely changed, and all the photos are retouched. Some of my friends are dead by now, but I do not want to be running ahead of the story, I will just go through all this again together with you. \n\n<center>https://s16.postimg.org/bjzhlwtth/x_c9850a04.jpg</center>\n\nNot everyone knows when the mafia in Russia started its way. It started much earlier, in the early '90s, when the Soviet Union had collapsed, and people were able to engage in business activities. Then the people who had the physical strength and desire to live well got craving to take someone else's. Young people, usually the members of sports clubs, formed criminal communities to accumulate power to take income of entrepreneurs and get the cash flow of the businesses. Often, the physical violence was applied against those who did not want to obey to frighten others. In Russia, there were hundreds of large and thousands of small criminal networks which not only \"earned\" a living by racket, but fought for it between each other. Most of the participants of those events are now in prison or dead.\n\nIt was a real criminal war, but I personally did not participate in it. For me everything started in 2003, when I was 13 years old. That day, my friends from the hood invited me to the boxing class. I was expecting this, because I already knew that the guys were doing something interesting, they just didn't want to share it with me, \"You'll know everything when you come,\" that was how they kept the intrigue. I was watching them from the side, I had not been in their social circle yet, I did not see anything illegal in what they did, but I was fascinated by their organized movement relied on the principle \u2013 One for all and all for one.\n\nIt meant that the cell of their community resolved all their problems on the streets.  Physical fights didn't happen often in our time, nobody wanted to deal with more than a hundred bald, well-organized men. If they expected some kind of more or less equal force coming up, they called up the larger number of community cells. It was 57 cells in total. Totally, it is more than 3,000 people at the peak of its activity in 2005. Many people were armed and almost all of them were boxers. It was a huge strength. \n\nBut I did not know any details back then. I just came to a boxing class to train under good coaches, the champions of Russia, Europe and the World. They were really good, they prepared a lot of champions of Russia, Europe and the World... I was excited by the fact that I would train with my friends, especially in a secret place. \n\nAfter the active part of the training, we all got in a large room with tables, where everybody drank tea. There were more than 100 people, many of them were standing at the door, because they could not come in. People were talking to each other. There was this steady low clatter in the room, I was drinking tea, munching cookies, and was not thinking about anything bad. It was fun and calm, all my close friends were sitting by my side, and I was just tired. \n\n<center>https://s16.postimg.org/gu4gd7e2d/\u043f\u0430\u0446\u0430\u043d\u044b3.png</center>\n\nIn a while we heard the voice saying, \"So, let's talk?\"\" And everybody got quiet. The guy with the appearance of 26-year-old with a wide scar on his forehead, began a one-sided dialogue with the team. But I did not really get what was going on, and at some point I even lost focus on what is happening and shut off myself from the world. Jolt to the elbow brought me back, someone whispered me to get up.\n\n\"That meant everybody would be sitting, and I had to get up? ... What the fuck?\" - I thought that I was not ready for this, but I had no choice, so I got up. \n\"Newbie? What's your name?\" - the guy with the scar said.\n\"Alex,\" - I replied.\n\"Alex, we have three golden rules: no weapons, no drugs, no crimes. We solve all our problems ourselves without police. Your friends will tell you the rest. Any questions?\" \n\"No questions.\"\n\"Then sit down, drink tea and enjoy yourself.\" \nI was shocked. I was not ready for that. I was discouraged, but at the same time I was amused by what was going on. \n\nTrainings went fast, I learned quickly and got used to everything. Every day, we played football, went to the gym, took the boxing classes, and everything was for FREE. Football? No problem. Workout? Sure. Boxing? All coaches were waiting for us. Trainings took place in our own two-story building, which included workout and boxing rooms, rooms for table tennis and billiards, and on the street we had mini and full-size football fields. \n\nWe paid only for tea, but it was nothing compared to how much they charged in regular sport clubs: 100 rubles a month, it's less than $ 2 in current money. At the same time, we did everything off our own bat. We did repairs in the hall, built the arbour and even the stadium with bleachers!!! And all of that was done with no outside help. We did everything using only our own resources, we had no wages, and nobody put pressure on us. \n\nIt is said that it is easy to get into the mafia, but difficult to leave. It was the opposite in our case. At every training, some man did a head check.  If you missed 3 trainings without good reason, you will be asked some questions. If you had nothing to answer, they would show you out. \n\nIf you decided to leave the community, nobody would make you pay. Also you will be not forced to bring a TV from home or do something like that. Want to leave? Go away, do not waste our time and do not dare to think bad about us. If you took something, bring it back. They didn't care about anything else.\n\nHow did we make our living? Parkings. We had been opening the night paid car parkings in the yards, and offered protection to the vehicles owners. From the parking money we had been paying for electricity in the building, buying building materials, paying cleaners and saving some to help those ones who were in jail.\n\nIn our language we called this help \"warming a prison\". It is when you send some stuff to a prison. For a prisoner the parcel itself is not so important, it is more important that someone actually cares about him. The parcel usually has cigarettes, candies and cookies, sometimes phones. You cannot call yourself a bro without this element of street life. \n\nAlso if someone on the street asks you a question \"Who are you?\" \nIf you answer - \"A man,\" they say, \"A man should work in the field, so go work.\" \n\"An athlete.\"  - \"So go and train.\" \n\"A bro.\"  - \"Who do you warm then?\" \nOn the street only a bro can talk to another bro as an equal, the verbal fight is a whole science. If a fight is against you, and you are not strong in it, it is likely you will lose and will be owing money to someone. But we have never lost and regularly trained our skills, including the street language. \n\nThose gyms, which were opened after ours, didn't have any source of income except the parkings. And even if they had, nobody talked about them, because they violate the three golden rules: no weapons, no drugs, no crimes. One parking could bring up to $ 5000 of a monthly net income, and every normal gym had, at least, 3 of them. We lived that way working on our own parkings. The older gyms also had other businesses: pharmacy chains, shops and so on... I do not know how they set up those businesses.\n\nMany young people were, literally, saved from drugs by our gyms. They were given the meaning and purpose to live. Many of the guys came from dysfunctional families, and lots of them had already taken the criminal path. But then they came to us, and their lives changed. They got work, exercises, friends and new very large social network. It doesn't look like a mafia yet, right? :-))\n\nBut first things first. At the time I was only 13 years old teenager taking the boxing classes. I liked the guys and the power I had behind me. I wasn't quite sure where I was and how it worked, and, of course, I could not imagine where this would lead me and what I would have to pass through. \n\nThe first little criminal history happened soon, it happened to me personally outside the gym. I knew one guy, his name was Sergey, he was 21, and once he took advantage of my trust. He asked me to give a cell phone to call, and as soon as I left, he disappeared. And that was my first cell phone. It was a real problem, because someone stole my phone, and I had to tell my brothers about it, explain everything to them. \n\nIt was a difficult day and training, I was getting closer and closer to the time when I had to tell everyone. I had to stand up in front of everybody and tell them what happened. It was frightening. But I believed that they would help me, would not leave my problem aside, and I would not have to talk about this bitter case to my parents. \n\nThe time to talk has come. There were many people, as always. And as always, there was a question at the end, \"Any questions? Problems?\"\n\"I have a problem,\" - I got up.  \n\"What happened?\" \n\"My phone was stolen\u2026\" -  And I told how it happened. My brothers listened to me, and then gave me the answer I didn't expect.\n\"You should solve the problem yourself. Do whatever it takes, but get back what belongs to you.\" \n\"But how? He is 2 heads taller, bigger and 8 years older than me. How do I make him give my stuff back?\" I asked. \n\"Now it's just your problem. Arm yourself with something, if you cannot deal with him barehanded. Watch him every day, break him. Do not come here until you have your problem solved,\" - that's what my brothers told me.\n\nIt was unexpected turn. That day I realized that my brothers wouldn't help me with all my problems, and that it was not that simple as it seemed before. Why did this guy just take my phone and get lost? Because he felt neither possible punishment nor my power. He was not even thinking about the power behind me. If he did not feel my strength, it meant that the team would not protect me. Every person is the team's face, and if I am like that, then everyone is. So I had to solve the problem myself, and I had to do it, whatever it cost me, because this gym was my entire social circle. \n\nIt was a hard challenge, and it changed my life. My friends were with me, despite the fact that I had to solve the problem myself, they said that they would come with me. We drove around the hood to find the bustard and punish him. But it was me who had to punish him.\n\nWe got there... In total there were about 3-4 cars and, maybe, 15 people. I did not believe that we would find him quickly, honestly, I did not believe that we would find him in general... But suddenly, we got him spotted. He was walking with his fighting dog in one yard in the hood, we drove up and surrounded him. We followed all the rules of a street fight. What happened next? ... I had to get up my guts, and I had only one chance. I had never been in an actual street fight before, I had been just training.\n\nMy opponent kept a stiff upper lip. Despite the fact that there were many people set against him, and I was so young and severe, he acted openly and rudely. He said he would not give me the phone back, because he did not see a man in me. That was the boiling point. After these words, it was the first time in my life when I felt fear changing to aggression. Hands do their job, and the adrenaline slows down what is happening. Bam! And the border is passed.\n\nDespite the fact that he was holding the fighting dog and was 2 heads taller than me, I set upon him with blows, having completely forgotten about the dog. Now I do not understand why it did not even bite me. My opponent did not dare to fight back, because he did not know how the other guys would react. I would not call it beating, it was a spirit manifestation, and it has changed me forever. I became acquainted with him and said \"hi\". \n\nI\u2019ve been getting back to this situation many times. It also helped me to survive in the army. It's not completely aggression. It is a self-defense, which switches on when you believe that a retreat is not an option. When all your words would not help the situation, so you have to fight, otherwise you will lose everything: your honor, your name, and, finally, yourself. \n\nI do not quite remember what the end of the scrummage was, but there was a police station across the street, and we did not want to be stuck there. It does not matter that I had not beaten him to a mummy or trodden him into the ground. I showed everyone what I was made of and I could do it again if needed - that is what really matters.\n\nWe left. The next day his aunt called me and offered to take the phone back (she had seen the whole process, and as far as I remember, she broke up our fight). I took what was mine, the problem was solved. On the second day I came back to the gym and told everyone about my success. Then my brothers told me, \"You should have solved your problem by yourself, but what's done is done. Good job.\"\n\nI would have different life without this victory. Further, I got a lot of \"combat\" experience, participated in many conflicts, was in charge for organization. My extraordinary intelligence and abilities distinguished me from other people. Of course, I was not a godfather or top dog... nothing of the kind. I was just a normal guy among my friends. Here I want to share with you some stories about our life. I would like to stop now. But, judging by the details I want to give you, we are far from the end of the story. \n\n<center>https://s16.postimg.org/v342v9sl1/\u043f\u0430\u0446\u0430\u043d\u044b2.png</center>",

Here is where they wash, dry and press the all the sheets, towels, and clothes of over eight thousand passengers and crew.\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/gf5xPXz.jpg</center>\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/QfEY84U.jpg</center>\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/v5ucKkZ.jpg</center>\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/7dryMQ6.jpg</center>\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/pLBCxjM.jpg</center>\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/Bv2HbG7.jpg</center>\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/ITU835d.jpg</center>\n\n# The Bridge\n\nThe Captain's personal office.  A very fancy room where he commands the ship.\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/repodJe.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/5FltrgB.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/Kng8Yw2.jpg</center>\n<center>*The view from the Bridge* </center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/takqeWz.jpg</center>\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/EgYFfUy.jpg</center>\n<center>*Our route in the Caribbean*</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/Aowv6e8.jpg</center>\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/OMNFwnc.jpg</center>\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/k1XoLr6.jpg</center>\n<center>*Three engines, each independently controlled*</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/R9vrrZn.jpg</center>\n<center>*Comfy*</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/d5t4tlt.jpg</center>\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/DgNmdw1.jpg</center>\n<center>*Right next to the bridge, they monitor alarms and status of the whole ship*</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/VBFMq0r.jpg</center>\n<center>*The Captain's Chair. Yes you can sit on it.*</center>\n\n# The Heli Bar\n\nWe weren't allowed to take pictures of the crew's personal spaces: restaurants, rest areas, etc. The only place we could register was the Heli Bar, their exclusive bar where they party and hang out on their off time, just below the ship's helipad.\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/3diOj4G.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/Jq8EasG.jpg</center>\n<center>*The light was really low so apologies for the blurriness*</center>\n\n*** \n\nAnd that's it. I really recommend taking this cruise, and I can post a review later if there's interest. I also recommend the All Access Tour, that, while pricey, shows you a huge world inside the ship that most people have no idea that it's there.\n\n*don't forget to follow @burnin for more things like this (and unlike this as well)*",

Don't forget to follow :)\n\nThe Earth is unique amongst the terrestrial planets in having a large satellite, the Moon, which, relative to the Earth, has the largest mass of any satellite-parent system. Numerous lines of evidence indicate that the Moon was derived from the Earth as the result of a singular impact event soon after the initial formation of the Earth. As a result, the subsequent evolution of the Earth and the emergence and development of life has been strongly influenced by the presence of the Moon.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/w2VnAiE.png\n\n#pointilism\n#art\n#design\n#holiday",

    "body": "<center>\nhttp://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset0.jpg\n</center>\nI was able to capture an interesting sunset sequence at Point Sur, California. In this first image it was apparent that this was going to be a beautifully textured sunset with the multi-layered Cirrocumulus clouds above and the Altocumulus clouds below. Additionally the low thin shoreline fog was beginning to slightly develop, giving the area immediately along the shore a mystical softness. Point Sur is a light house, for more info go [here](http://www.pointsur.org/).\n\n<center>\nhttp://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset5.jpg\n*Point Sur Sunset Stage 2*</center>\nI wandered around the area trying to set up a classic \"rule-of-thirds\" composition using both horizontal and vertical positioning. Lots of times the issue is that there are just too many cool ways to shoot the image. So, I opted to shoot it a number of different ways, especially as time went on and colors shifted against the available light making the image more mysterious. \n[Go here to see larger version](http://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset5.jpg)\n\n<center>\nhttp://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset2.jpg\n*Point Sur Sunset Stage 3*</center>\nI'm shooting from about a mile away from Point Sur and was attempting to correctly gauge what the prime spot would be to capture the sun \"spash\" effect as it intersected with the horizon. Over the ocean it is a very beautiful effect if caught at exactly the right moment, but I suddenly realized that effect would be obfuscated by Point Sur itself so I needed to alter my shot composition setup.\n\n<center>\nhttp://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset3.jpg\n*Point Sur Sunset Stage 4*</center>\nRunning like a madman with my equipment bag, tripod and camera gear I scrambled to get in position on the right side of Point Sur to capture at least some of the horizon flare effect, and was able to get in position and set up, right in the nick of time! What I like about this shot is the way the sun rays on the right side are stopped by the sand dune on the shoreline. You can see it slightly glow along the top edge of the dune as it casts a shadow across the pasture.\n[Go here to see larger version](http://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset3.jpg)\n\n<center>\nhttp://geraldzmorse.com/images/steemit/Point-Sur-Sunset4.jpg\n*Point Sur Sunset Stage Cows*</center>\nThen backing out the frame I noticied I had company... these guys had been somewhat following me around while I was doing this... they must have thought I was crazy! LOL... \nWow, what a view they have every day.",

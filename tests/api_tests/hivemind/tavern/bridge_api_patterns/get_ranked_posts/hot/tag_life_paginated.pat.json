    "body": "# Why, Hello There, World\n\nHi, my name is James Brown and I'm what some like to call a \"health-nut\".  \n\n# Here's My Typical Day\n\n* I get 9 to 10 hours of sleep every night.  \n* I stretch and give myself messages with various self-massage tools for 45 minutes to an hour.\n* I drink at least 2 gallons of purified water.\n* I jump rope for 30 minutes on an anti-fatigue mat, 6 days a week.\n* I follow-up skipping rope with 5 to 10 minutes of push-ups, followed by another 5 to 10 minutes of bent-over underhand rows.  I do these together in order to give my body a balance of \"push\" and \"pull\" on my muscles, seeing to it that adding muscle doesn't pull my posture forward or backward.\n* I jog outside, in beautiful nature trails, for anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours, 3 to 6 times per week.\n* I do a heavy-lifting routine with barbells and dumbbells for 1 to 1.5 hours, 2 to 3 days per week.\n* I do a Pilates, core workout, routine for 45 minutes to an hour, 3 to 4 days per week.\n* I eat A LOT of greens, fruits, beans, nuts and seeds.\n* I especially eat lots of hemp seed (hearts), oatmeal, and organic peanut butter (heavy protein) - usually all mixed together.  It tastes heavenly :)\n* I meditate for 20 to 30 minutes in the morning and sometimes for another 15 to 20 minutes before I go to sleep at night.\n\nI do these things routinely and I LOVE doing it.  I feel great!  I feel healthy, vital, strong, flexible, calm and relaxed.  My mind is clear and focused on my goals and the people whom I love.  I'm happy and healthy physically, psychologically, and socially.  Everything is good :)\n \n# My Goal Here On Steemit..\n\n...is to share some of my health-tips and personal techniques that I've used to make it easy and painless to develop healthier habits.  I plan to share some of the tools I use to loosen up my body, making it feel wonderful and bringing all the \"life\" to the muscles that they need in order to get the most out of stretching and exercising them.  I'll go through how I approach exercise and weight-lifting.  I'll share my secrets on how to build a strong and flexible body in a way that's fun and effective.  I'll touch base on my diet approach and even share some delicious and nutritious recipes.\n\n# Keep Your Eyes Peeled\n\nI'll be around @feelinggood.  Throw me an up-vote and a follow if you like where I'm going with this.\n\nI'm so excited to share my secrets to healthy and happy living :)\n\n# Peace.\n\n<center><img src=\"http://quotes.greet2k.com/image-code/health-3.jpg\"></center><br>\n<center><([source image](http://quotes.greet2k.com/image-code/health-3.jpg))></center>",

    "body": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/draper2.jpg\n\nThe below three marketing campaigns have impacted their respective companies not only with massively increased profits but the invaluable brand recognition that has made them household names we know them as today. Clever marketing can skyrocket a brand and even create a industry around your product - (see De Beers below). \n\nMarketers know how to tap into the collective consciousness and read the human psyche to ascertain the emotive reasons for buying, rather than functional. It's rare you'll see advertising that will actually list a products functions these days. Most adverts try to make you feel a certain way and relate that to their product. If you feel good watching a razor advert and that brand crosses your eye at the supermarket, you will subconsciously feel drawn towards it.\n\nHats off to the evil genius of advertising!\n\n\n**1. NIKE - JUST DO IT!**\n\nhttp://www.companyfolders.com/blog/media/2015/01/nike-300x170.jpg\n\nNike used to make trainers for marathon runners only. They recognised a fitness trend early and their marketing department thought of a slogan in the late 80's to try to surpass their closest competitors, Reebok. JUST DO IT!\n\nNike sales went up from $800m in 1988 to $9.2b  by 1998. The slogan was short, snappy and entirely relatable.  No-one really enjoys excising when they start doing it so the JUST DO IT! campaign tapped into what people were thinking. Want to start running but can't be bothered? JUST DO IT! Want to push yourself and go to the gym? JUST DO IT!\n\nA simple message that people understood propelled Nike to the forefront of fitness gear and they have been enjoying the number one spot ever since. Kudos.\n\n**MARLBORO - THE MARLBORO MAN**\n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/radiotv/graphics/marlboroman.jpg\n\nSelling a highly addictive drug is probably a dream product to marketers but having a cigarette smoker choose your particular brand is more difficult. Marlboro began running Marlboro Man ads in the fifties and they wanted to advertise the lifestyle of the consumer, not the product. \n\nDo you want to live free like a cowboy? Do you want to be a real man? Do you want to do you own thing? This is what the Marlboro Man represented. He was the epitome of masculinity and he allowed Marlboro cigarettes to fit into the lifestyle of the consumer and allow the consumer to have the illusion that that particular cigarette made him like a cowboy.\n\n\n**DE BEERS - A DIAMOND IS FOREVER**\n\nhttp://www.thediamondauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/diamond-is-forever-300x238.jpg\n\nPrevious to the famous De Beers slogan, engagements rings were not seen as a luxury item and didn't cost too much money. They were sometimes ruby's or semi-precious stones as a symbol of a betrothed couple. \n\nDe Beers changed the game. They thought that instead of promoting their product into the existing jewelry marketplace, they would create a whole new industry around diamonds. Now, even if a women knows the history of the marketing of diamond engagement rings, they will still demand one. That is how ingrained the marketing has become. \n\nAs soon as you walk out of a jeweler with a diamond engagement ring, it devalues by 50%. There is an inflated price due to De Beers stockpiling the product to give false scarcity and they have conditioned every woman in the western world to believe that a man should spend at least one months salary on a diamond. If that isn't a stroke of evil genius marketing, I don't know what is!\n\nMarketing can make a relatively inexpensive product seem luxurious and essential and De Beers carried this out masterfully.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nLet me know what marketing campaigns you think have been most successful below and if you like my work, follow me and check out some of my other posts [HERE](https://steemit.com/@doubledex).",

    "body": "My day job brings me in contact with many mentally ill or abused individuals. We can be cruel to each other. I witness enough purposeful cruelty to grow weary at times, but never enough to call it quits. I have been thinking on this frequently.\n\nJust as [I choose to celebrate the positive legacies of those I have lost](https://steemit.com/relationships/@honeyscribe/celebrating-losses-in-life-and-death), I choose to celebrate the personal successes of the individuals I work with. Have they faced severe tragedy? Often the answer is yes. Yet they choose persistence and recovery. Even when they want to stay in bed. \n\n<center>(https://anonmgur.com/up/12ad11aaeba5286984df064b24c5bbc0.jpg) </center>\n\nAs a person who shares in their histories and their struggles, I am astounded. [I spoke about magic yesterday.](https://steemit.com/life/@honeyscribe/do-you-believe-in-magic) The repatterning of the brain through conscious positive thought was listed as magic to me. The reason is this: \n\nWhy keep trying?\n\nWhy get up?\n\nWhy love again?\n\nQuitting seems the simpler option, yet we persist in our belief there is something better.\n\nWe search for purpose. \n\nWe create entirely new lives for ourselves. \n\nWe succeed. \n\nI see it over and over. Humans at their lowest insistent on reaching for their highest\n\n## and achieving it!\n\n<center> (https://anonmgur.com/up/d7d4ef0d35598ec3e02d0eec2b919e6e.jpg)\n*Chocolate earned.* </center>\n\nLittle else in life inspires me so much. Especially as I know what it is like to *want* to stay down. Somehow I have kept myself moving. It is a profound statement of personal ability. \n\nI am adding to my commitment to celebrate. I do not only want to celebrate positive memories. I want to cheer for consciously positive actions, regardless of size. There are times in life when brushing my teeth twice a day is asking too much of me. To my amazement, as depression is no small hindrance, I always manage to brush at least once. From now on, I will give myself a round of applause for completing that basic act of self-care. \n\nI hope you will join me. We may need to look for actions to celebrate. We will begin to spot them quicker. \n\n<center>(https://anonmgur.com/up/3d0adddea5123c9d3e1dddbb2ddb99ae.png) </center>\n\n## What are you celebrating today?\n\n*All images sourced through Pixabay.*",

    "body": "Is this a typo? Benefits? You ask. How could there be any possible benefit from having a disability?\n\nWell, in fact there are. And here are three unexpected benefits I have personally experienced in my own journey living with a degenerating eye condition.\n\n## Improved lateral thinking and innovation\nGrowing up with a vision impairment meant that there were often things that most people took for granted, but which I struggled to do. To do the same things, I needed to come up with creative solutions and alternative ways of doing things. So from a very young age, I learnt to think laterally and developed my problem solving skills. Most people are so use to perceiving the world in a certain way, but when you are stripped of one of your senses, you learn to perceive things in a different way.\n\nhttps://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmWb5pzYhKKJZ8zmeYqVeV6oNqGi5h7yDEtxBbjwRdTUZ7\n\nWhen I was still living by myself a few years ago, I had the annoying task of having to cook for myself each night. The challenge I faced in the kitchen was not been able to read the labels on various bottles and containers. As a result, I couldn't tell which container was the salt and which one was the sugar, and all the packaging for the herbs looked the same. So how did I manage? Instead of using sight, I used my sense of smell to distinguish between the herbs, and for some ingredients where I couldn't use the sense of smell, I used different containers and labels to help me identify all the different ingredients.\n\nAnd this leads on to the second benefit.\n\n## Improved memory\nPeople who know me well often comment on my ability to remember things. In fact, I've noticed this in many other people I know who also have a vision impairment. I think this is due to the fact that for someone with a vision impairment to thrive in a sighted world, we often need to make extra effort to adapt to our circumstances.\n\nFor example, I remember when I was still in university, I had to do many presentations. For most people, they could refer to speech notes as they are presenting. However, for me, this was not possible, as I couldn't read speech notes no matter how big the font was. Furthermore, as I have some sight, I never needed to learn braille, which meant I couldn't refer to braille notes either. _As a side note, this is why the title of my memoir which I've been posting on Steemit is \"Living in Between Two Worlds\", because I have often found myself being caught between the world of the sighted and the world of the blind, and also between the identity of being Chinese but not fully Chinese, and being Australian but not fully Australian._ As a result, every time I had to do a presentation, I would always remember the entire speech. Over time, this has become second nature to me. I have learnt how to force things into my memory, and be innovative when I need to.\n\n## Resilience\nGrowing up with a vision impairment, I experienced a lot of bullying at school and a lot of hurtful comments and actions from people, sometimes done knowingly and sometimes unknowingly. Sometimes this comes in the form of a patronising comment, and sometimes from a look or stare. The interesting thing with people staring and giving me strange looks is that I can often notice people are doing it to me because I have some peripheral vision, however people generally can't tell I'm looking back at them because it doesn't seem like I'm looking at them. Most of the time however, those hurtful words and actions are done out of ignorance and a lack of understanding, rather then out of malice.\n\n#### But from all these things I've experienced, it has made me a stronger and more resilient person.\nAs a result, whatever unforeseen things I may experience in life, there's not much that can knock me out completely. I have developed the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and stay optimistic, because as they say:\n### What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.\n\nSo I'm thankful to God for the person I have become today. Disability isn't all bad. Without what I have gone through with my vision impairment, I wouldn't be the person I am today, and for these reasons, I am thankful.\n\nTo read more about my story, you can read my short memoir series.

    "body": "<html>\n<center><img src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j132/mgaft1/steemit/reset1_zpsvq2qnyuf.jpg\"></center>\n<p>Liz liked that his name was Robert, starting with the same letter as her husband\u2019s. There are certain moments when a woman wants to say the name of her partner out loud. Both men being started from the same letter saved her some confusion.</p>\n<p>She met Robert in Kinko when the worker messed up her set of copies and she requested a manager. She noticed sparkles of excitement in his eyes when he first looked at her and sparkles of humor when he listened to her complaints and, somehow easily, she let him lull her into resolving their disagreement in the nearby Starbucks. &nbsp;Nothing came out of it...Besides maybe a couple of sweet emails. Nothing. Yet.</p>\n<p>Liz stretched with the pleasure of remembrance and supposition. It was eight-thirty AM on Wednesday. The beach, place of her daily morning stroll after dropping kids to school, was almost completely deserted. She looked at the horizon and her train of thought switched to the contemplation of her life in general.</p>\n<p>She knew that everybody thought she had it made. Fifteen years ago she married a successful attorney. Now she was the \u201clady of the castle\u201d as she often thought of herself. Indeed she had a great house, Jaguar, a yacht, trips over the Atlantic where she got to dine in the restaurant on top of the Ethel tower, took a gondola ride in Venice and ski in Swiss Alps. Meetings with relatives, she could sit with proud and accomplished countenance if not with the hint of arrogance to them \u201call\u201d - well dressed, well-groomed and feeling above all their skirmishes and little territorial disputes. Roger and kids were her life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But\u2026 Was she HAPPY?</p>\n<p>Was this life to her ultimate liking? Something she chose to live or something she settled for?</p>\n<p>Back when they met \u2013 their relationship were new, exciting, different. Roger Powell came across as smart, witty, charming and certainly way more attractive than all other people in the town; certainly, much more, overall, attractive than Tony Beady - her high school sweetheart. And back then when she was twenty-two and Robert was forty the difference in age didn\u2019t feel so much.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But now, more often than not, she really felt it. His age manifested itself on the top of his head where now Liz could witness the color of his skin, with the heavy breathing when they were hiking, with the special diet he had to adhere to and a BP medicine he had to take and with (ah how unromantic) the sample of his urine she had to take today to the lab for his kidney test.</p>\n<p>But especially it was noticeable in the bedroom. From spontaneous and frequent, their lovemaking became much less spontaneous and, alas, so much less frequents. To hint this to Roger was humiliating whereas he as if realizing his shortcomings, became suspicious and possessive.</p>\n<p>If she could only return these moments of excitement, of passion! Liz buttoned her coat because a gust of wind made her feel cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, may I have some of your time, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Startled, Liz quickly turned around and shivered. Behind her, literally next to her, there stood a tall man. Not that she sensed anything threatening, in fact, he seemed as polite as an experienced salesman, but his sheer appearance \u201cfrom a thin air\u201d and his contradictory conduct made her feel alerted.</p>\n<p>On one hand, he looked old \u2013 wrinkly face, a completely gray hair, the eye color that used to be blue now dissolved into off white. On the other hand, his smile and demeanor were of the relatively young man, the one who knew of his charm and tried to make a use of it. </p>\n<center><img src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j132/mgaft1/steemit/reset5_zpsbyeecsll.jpg\"></center>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Liz\u2019s answer lacked confidence. \u201cAre you a reporter of a sort?\u201d Roger was a respected member of the community and, now and then, their photograph flickering in the local newspaper.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf a sort, of a sort, mam and, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t take much of your time.\u201d The man\u2019s lips stretched.</p>\n<p>\u2018Weirdo,\u2019 Liz mentally rolled her eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the man pulled out a gadget, what Liz originally thought, was a movie camera, but what turned out to be a cell phone looking device with unusually large footprint.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you please hold it for me?\u201d he handed the gadget to Liz showing sign of approaching sneeze. Liz held it through two sneezes and then gave it back. \u201cBless you.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now looking from his side Liz saw that the display panel had two viewing areas, left one labeled \u201cBio-Time Server\u201d and the right one labeled as \u201cBio-Time Receiver,\u201d with the button labeled \u201cTransmit\u201d in between. </p\n\n><center><img src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j132/mgaft1/steemit/reset4_zpsorggc6te.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>To her utmost surprise Liz saw that the left panel contained her information: </p>\n<p>  Name: Elisabeth Powell &nbsp;<br>\n  Biological age &nbsp;37&nbsp;<br>\n  Psychological age &nbsp;22&nbsp;<br>\n  Donated Age &nbsp;0 \u2026 </p>\n<p>The right one contained the information, apparently, of the reporter: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>  Leslie Berwick &nbsp;<br>\n  Biological Age &nbsp;77 &nbsp;<br>\n  Psychological age &nbsp;50&nbsp;<br>\n  Donated Age &nbsp;-43 &nbsp;\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Liz approached closer to the gadget.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cA little patience, ma'am.\u201d Leslie winked at her and then again looked down at the gadget that displayed green status line message \u201cLoading Transmission Matrix. Please wait...\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As soon as the message changed to \u201cReady to Transmit\u201d Leslie looked around the beach both direction and quickly, almost hurriedly pressed the Transmit button.</p>\n<p>The message box showed: You are about to transmit 20 Bio-Time years from Elizabeth Powell to Leslie Berwick. Are you sure?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWait just a second!\u201d Liz started suspecting that something was wrong. \u201cWhatever you are doing, I don\u2019t want you to use my name for whatever it is that you are doing!\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI am afraid, ma\u2019am,\u201d Leslie smirked, about to press the \u201cYes\u201d option, \u201cthis is already not in your power.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, so fast Berwick!\u201d Liz heard a new voice and observed the gadget flying four feet away.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, MacFearson,\u201d Leslie rushed after the device as fast as he could, \u201cdidn\u2019t you mother teach you to knock?\u201d The man, who kicked the gadget out of Leslie\u2019s hands was faster and took a position between Berwick and the device. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Leslie, who apparently used to act quickly, swung at MacFearson, but the later, acted even faster and with one short right hook to the jaw, dropped Leslie and letting him lay face down in the sand, picked up the device and turned to Liz who was in the state of a complete bewilderment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSpecial Agent Sam MacFearson, ma-am.\u201d The man bowed. \u201c\u2026sorry that you had to go through this, Mrs\u2026\u201d he looked at the left panel of the device. \u201cMrs. Powell. Luckily, I arrived just in time to stop him.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026stop him from what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026from stealing\u201d he looked at the device again \u201cof twenty years of your bio-time.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWell thank you, officer.\u201d By now Liz has already come to her senses. \u201cAnd you are, I guess, from the \u2026 future,\u201d she made exaggeratedly big eyes and lifted her eyebrows.</p>\n<p>MacFearson nodded as if not even noticing her irony keeping his eyes on the tall figure of Berwick spread on the sand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t I, knowing this all,\u201d she made a wide gesture pointing both to the device and knocked out man, \u201cchange something in the future?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMrs. Powell, normally we try to avoid contacts with the subjects from the \u201cpast.\u201d But since the contact has already occurred we are obligated by law to minimize the possibility of a bio-time theft.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Sam stopped for a moment as if struggling with himself. \u201c\u2026you see, where Berwick and I came from it\u2019s a common offense. Well, actually, the \u201ctime donating\u201d is a legitimate business, sort of like the organ donating in your time. But time is expensive and only a few wealthy people can afford it or it could be done between close relatives. So pirates acquire Bio-Time illegally and resell it on the Black market, which results in big losses to the company I am working for. \u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cBio-time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2026sorry. A time travel seemingly might gain you some time. But if you spend two weeks in Ancient Rome, you\u2019d still be biologically two weeks older. Bio-time would, in fact, make you younger or older depending on whether you sold or bought it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how come did this Berwick chose specifically me?\u201d Liz pointed to the old man who still lay unconscious. \u201cHow did he know I would be here waiting for him?\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cAn accident, pure accident, Mrs. Powell. What wasn\u2019t an accident was the fact that Berwick was going so far back in time. You see with the modern Global Planetary Security System (GPSS), it is close to impossible to execute the time theft. But GPSS is calibrated only from the year 2050 so pirates like Berwick, travel earlier than that. They make themselves both donors and recipients \u2013 sell their time in the future, jump to a remote past, pirate bio-time, make themselves young and then come back to resale it in the future. Berwick made his last sale two bio days ago - thirty bio-years to a broker in Hong-Kong. This made him quite old, the circumstance, as you could observe, that made it much easier for me to neutralize him. When Berwick is bio-young he is a pretty dangerous in hand-to-hand combat.\u201d MacFearson shook his head \u201cyes\u201d with appreciation.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless a large company like <em><strong>Travel Anywhere</strong></em> does the arrangements, it\u2019s a pretty risky to travel so far into the past, unpredictable both in the sense of the time slot and in circumstances of the landing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how were you able to track us so easily?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, our agency was tracking Berwick already for a while. We were just waiting to catch him in action.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;MacFearson stopped and pulled on his lower lip. \u201cStill I am not sure how he was able to bypass the transmitter security,\u201d then he mumbled to himself\u201c\u2026he needed a sample of your DNA\u2026 Tell me, Mrs. Powell, did Berwick somehow have gotten a hold of your fingerprints?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She wrinkled her forehead remembering. \u201cWait, he asked me to hold this thingy,\u201d she pointed to the device,\u201d while he was sneezing.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u201c\u2026Ah, there we go. Anything other questions ma\u2019am?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. MacFearson, what was that other number on the panel? The one that said I am twenty-two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, how should one put it?\u201d He scratched his chin arranging an explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s that age that describes how old you feel rather than how old you are, actually. Make sense?\u201d</p>\n<p>Liz nodded.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cAs for your concern regarding you affecting anything in the future. Don\u2019t even worry about it, because in a couple of minutes when we\u2019re done I will erase your memory of this incident. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s very safe.\u201d He added seeing her hand instinctively lifting to defend her head. MacFearson turned away from the pirate, smiled and looked Liz in the eyes. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSam!\u201d Liz screamed, seeing with her peripheral vision that Berwick within this short moment woke up and was aiming at MacFearson. \u201cHE\u2019S GOT THE GUN!\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MacFearson spun around pulling his own weapon. Two laser beams sparked at the same time and both men instantly evaporated.</p>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j132/mgaft1/steemit/reset2_zpsppg97iha.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>Shaken and exhausted, Liz sat on the sand with her thoughts in disarray. What was she supposed to do? Call the police? Which police, from what time, how? Did all of this actually happen? Oh yes, it did \u2013 the transmitter laid next to her on the sand. MacFearson apparently resets it but the power was still on. Whatever happened was unbelievable; made absolutely no sense. It made sense but only to her. No not only to her, to millions of people somewhere in the future. After seeing laser shots Liz was pretty sure of that. Oh, what a mess? Liz\u2019s eye watered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two people died in her presence and she couldn\u2019t do a thing about it. It was nice, at least, that there was no blood or anything. But still\u2026 The tears continued to roll while she wanted that someone big, strong and kind came to her and calmed her down. Put her in bed, covered her with a blanket and tucked it in \u2026 then, maybe, they could do something else.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Phooey\u2026This was just stupid. Stupid. She was a big and responsible adult. She could handle it. If only the difference in age with Roger wouldn\u2019t be so drastic. If she could only return these emotionally fulfilled moments of excitement, of passion!</p>\n<p>With widened eyes, Liz looked at the transmitter turning around the thought in her head.</p>\n<p>If she could give him five years of her life then their difference would be only eight years. Five years? What kind of a difference do they make? What is going to happen with her over these years? Nothing but frustration and boredom. What does she live for anyway? Is there a purpose? Procreation? Haven\u2019t she already done with that? Roger and she didn\u2019t plan to have more children. Certainly, she still needed to care for them and love them and stuff, but really, at this point in time, she was sort of living on overdrive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Five years?</p>\n<p>If she wanted to go alone with it, she better do it and do it fast. Who knows who else would pop up from the thin air? Nervously Liz looked at the device. There was no keypad except for numbers. She entered the number five.</p>\n<p>MacFearson talked about DNA. But how can she get Roger\u2019s DNA? Wait\u2026 Liz run toward the car got Roger\u2019s urine sample and turning away her nose she poured a drop of it on the recipient side of the device. Yes! Roger\u2019s data appeared on the panel. Now she thumb-printed the server side and her data appeared there as well. Liz pressed the button.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You are about to transmit 5 Bio-Time years from Elizabeth Powell to Roger Powell. Are you sure?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Was she? Liz was shivering. Was she really ready to give away five years of her own youth so that Roger and she could, perhaps, experience emotional fulfillment? What if not? What if this would be a stupid useless loss? What if the spring in a relationship only possible once? Her psychological age was twenty-two. This meant she didn\u2019t at all grow as a person since she got married.</p>\n<p>Robert, young, powerful! He was excited about her. Even now when she was so much older than him. With him, she would experience the emotional fulfillment once again and I would grow as a person.</p>\n<center><img src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j132/mgaft1/steemit/reset3_zpsf1wnbbtr.jpg\"></center>\n<p>Liz pushed the \u2018No\u2019 button, reset the device and quickly redone the procedure, now putting her husband on the donor and herself on the receiving side. Five years? No, I want to come back to the beginning, to the same point where I started.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Liz entered the digit fifteen and pressed the transmit button.</p>\n<p>You are about to transmit 15 Bio-Time years from Roger Powell to Elizabeth Powell. Are you sure?</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Liz said out loud and pushed the button again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "In [yesterday's episode](https://steemit.com/story/@ericvancewalton/alarm-clock-dawn-an-original-novel-episode-29) Adam watched as Marcus was gunned down in cold blood at XenTek headquarters. The kill order was issued by Seth Busby himself. This was Seth's first attempt to show Johann he was indeed tough enough to take the helm at XenTek. This one decision will be something that has the potential to cast a shadow over the rest of his days. \n\n\nEpisode 30 is monumental in that it marks the halfway point but there is much more yet to come. \n\nDid Evelyn survive the night with the black widow spider? Will Johann decide to make more jumps into the future to steal technology from his own company? Who is this Ikeda person that\u2019s being mentioned (Disclaimer: he\u2019s my favorite character.)? You\u2019ll find out all this and more in the days to come.\n\nWelcome to today's episode of Alarm Clock Dawn!\n\n---\n \n<center> *Did you miss Episode 29 of Alarm Clock Dawn? If so [click here](https://steemit.com/story/@ericvancewalton/alarm-clock-dawn-an-original-novel-episode-29) to catch up.* </center> \n\n<center> Are you new to Alarm Clock Dawn? If so [click here](https://steemit.com/story/@ericvancewalton/alarm-clock-dawn-an-original-novel-part-1) to start at the beginning. </center>\n\n---\n\n<center> ![](https://s16.postimg.org/qqq0yhmd1/image.png) </center>\n\n---\n\n### CHAPTER 10 ###\n\n\n\u201cMr. Busby, this is Captain Ellis. The mission is complete. The target has been apprehended and terminated. Over.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good, Captain. Now it is imperative we find Adam Harkin. He's a valuable asset to us. Send out a locator on his Consumer Identification Card immediately. If he has his C.ID badge or Holo on his person, it will also reveal to us his precise location.\u201d Busby made his way to the director\u2019s office for an emergency briefing he had just been  summoned to attend. Only two people were on the invite: he and Evelyn Poltier, the head of Research and Development. \n\nTo say that Johann Pfizer's second in command was relieved that Marcus had been caught was an understatement, but Busby realized he hadn\u2019t escaped unscathed yet.\n\n\u201cTell me what the hell is going on!\u201d the director barked from behind his desk as Busby entered his office. The door clicked as it closed behind him. \n\nBusby's hands shook as he stopped directly in front of Johann Pfizer\u2019s desk. \u201cSir, the guard tried to escape. I understand that a kill order wasn't the ideal method, but given the circumstances it was our only choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Harkin?\u201d The director asked, his jaw clenched in anger. \n\nBusby felt the anxiety level in the room escalating, and his voice cracked as a result. \u201cSir, he hasn't been found yet, but Captain Ellis has assured me that he is making it his top priority.\u201d \n\nThe director sprung up like a tiger, grabbing Seth\u2019s necktie just under the knot, pulling him off his feet and across the desk. Seth's eyes bulged, his chest pinned flat against the desktop. Johann leaned down and in a quiet, snakelike whisper just inches from his ear said, \u201cListen to me very carefully, Busby, more carefully than you ever have in your life. We are now in the midst of a situation more crucial than you can even imagine. Because of your incompetence we now must race to clean up this mess. Ms. Poltier has disappeared. We tried to locate her Consumer I.D. signal and she's not even showing up on the grid. I explicitly told you to watch her closely. She\u2019s extremely smart and knows far too many of our secrets, secrets that could easily destroy us. Now use all the resources at your disposal. We must find them both. Do not fail me this time.\u201d \n\nJohann relaxed his grip on the wrinkled necktie, and Seth's eyes watered as he struggled to catch his breath. He straightened his crooked tortoise shell glasses and nodded. \n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d as his chest heaved with each inhalation. \n\nJohann walked slowly around the front of his desk, staring Seth in the eyes. \u201cSince I will soon be transitioning control to you, I'll have to brief you on everything eventually, and I suppose there is no time like the present to begin. Please sit down.\u201d Johann\u2019s voice had suddenly taken on a quieter, gentler tone. \n\nHe sat down on the corner of his desk and rested his hands on his knees, pausing for a long moment. Seth knew this was the precise point where his reality finally caught up with his dreams and his destiny became forever intertwined with XenTek. The silence of this moment seemed deafening as he took what would be his last breath of innocence.\n\n\u201cSeth, what I'm about to tell you will surely change you. It will alter what you believed was your reality and it will come as a shock. A lot of things have happened in the last few decades that a very small and a very select group of people in the world have official knowledge about. What I told the board members last night about the UFO wreckage and the exclusive contracts that XenTek secured from our government was true, but it was only the beginning.\u201d\n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/qoZYnzZHq3ziM.gif) </center>\n\nBusby shifted forward in anticipation and pushed up his glasses onto the bridge of his nose with his finger as the director continued.\n\n\u201cXenTek had released most of the products reverse engineered from the wreckage in fifteen short years. We are talking about lasers, the semiconductor, and fiber optics. We were desperate for more, as were our shareholders. Our programmers uncovered things we were never meant to learn in the craft\u2019s computers about several different alien civilizations. This knowledge was even more valuable than any of the technology we harvested. We eventually deciphered their written languages, and we began reaching out to communicate with a certain group of them that were known to openly trade with civilizations less advanced than their own.\u201d\n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/lrYGEvZp97wTS.gif) </center>\n\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, just a few years after I took over XenTek, we held open, face-to-face meetings between our company, the government, and the Agemo. The Agemo are composed of two different neighboring civilizations that have joined forces. The Agemo group sent a team of diplomats that landed in their craft at night right in the Terra Valley on the very site where the Phoenix collider is today.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll of this has been kept secret from the Consumers of this world. The government was very concerned about losing control of the population and causing mass hysteria, so when any news related to this did leak, it was always counterbalanced in the media with false news stories, and it worked wonderfully. Seth, these civilizations are millions of years more advanced than our own, but we quickly learned that just like us, some were good and some were bad. Oh, what a glorious night that was! It was our finest hour. We struck two major agreements from that particular round of negotiations.\u201d\n\n<center> ![](http://i.giphy.com/11Iy9AE36WSTOo.gif) </center>\n\nJohann smiled as he paused for a moment to reminisce. He got up from his desk and looked out the window, putting his hands in his pants pockets as he continued. \u201cThe faction of the Agemo just needed one thing\u2014gold and lots of it. Their home planet was becoming too warm and their plan was to suspend fine gold dust in their atmosphere to help reflect the sun's heat away from their planet. Do you remember when our government moved away from the gold standard that backed our currency?\u201d \n\nSeth\u2019s brain was on complete overload and he could only manage to nod his head in shock.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n<center> ![](https://s18.postimg.org/9phdrughl/TBC.png) </center>\n\n---\n\n*Alarm Clock Dawn is the first novel of a trilogy. The sequel entitled, Truth Is Stranger, will be published in the Spring of 2017.*\n\n<center> ![](https://s14.postimg.org/dlcthfcxd/image.jpg) </center>\n\nPlease visit [my website](http://www.ericvancewalton.net) to sign up for my author newsletter.

And this seems to be the case for more individuals these days as an increasing number get out of school, loaded with student loan debt, and unable to find a job. Real estate bubbles fueling sky-rocketing house prices, thanks to the Federal Reserve and its low interest rates, also haven't been helping the matter. \n\n<center> https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2016/07/24/636049157125156907828879602_white.jpg </center>\n\nBack only a couple of decades ago,  it seemed like you didn't need that great of a job and yet you could still afford to get a home and live on your own, but now millions of people are finding it's difficult to get by even when both parents are out in the work force. \n\n<center> https://media1.giphy.com/media/J8Iqja8CXfMw8/200_s.gif </center> \n\nMy friend Steven just turned 32 and he still lives at home while trying to save up for his own place, and while trying to pay off student loans and other debts. He could technically move out on his own now, he has the ability and funds to, but if he did then he would struggle with a much lower standard of living. Instead of choosing that option, he decides to stay right where he is because that way he can have a higher standard of living; although he'll need to put-up with the negative judgments from others about choosing to still live at home.\n\n<center> https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/bhLi9N3ce2mQpEotY50okUmzfw4/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2014/12/03/068/n/1922283/88078dd8a2c177bf_tumblr_m2wow2jYeD1qgcra2o1_r1_500/i/When-He-Says-What-We-All-Wanted.gif </center> \nFor some people they really just can't get along with their families for too much time and for their own sanity and healthy it's probably better that they separate and try to live on their own. But for the families that can get along and work positively and peacefully together as a network, what drawback is there to living at home past a certain age, aside from the negative judgments associated with it? If anything, I see a lot of benefit that can be had from living this way. \n\n<center> http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/5616x3741+0+2/resize/640x426!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://hss-prod.hss.aol.com/hss/storage/adam/73d6ba71eca9fdac90982fda290eedb7/83590572.jpg </center> \n\nFor example, my friend Karen and her husband still choose to live at home with her family. They have a beautiful home with lots of room for everyone and there are at the moment 7 people living in the house, because the grandparents live downstairs while the parents and kids live upstairs. \n\nThe grandparents are always there to babysit the kids, cook when its needed, and the kids and parents can offer the grandparents help too whenever they need it, like rides to the doctor or grocery store, or maybe help with some yard work. They work together peacefully and voluntarily in order to help each other and they all benefit from it and are able to have a higher standard of living because of it. \n\n<center> http://grandmother-blog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Living-with-parents.jpg </center> \n\nIt's easy to shame people who still live at home but I try not to be too quick in rushing to judgment because you never know what circumstances brought them there. And for all I know they could be enjoying a much higher standard of living than my own, who am I to judge? I think there can be a lot of benefit to living with family so that you can help one another and it also helps to save potentially hundreds if not thousands of dollars.",

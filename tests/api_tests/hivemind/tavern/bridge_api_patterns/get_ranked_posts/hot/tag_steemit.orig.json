Its mission is to help reward content creators who are posting great original content, yet who have not yet become established. In the short time since Curie began, our writers group has partnered with @nextgencrypto and other whale accounts to bring rewards to these deserving authors. *Writers, artists, chefs, photographers, videographers, and many others have been recognized by these rewards.*\n\nEach day, the members of our Project will publish this list of the posts that Project Curie has chosen to reward recently. We hope that this list will provide more positive exposure to the authors we have selected. Also, it is an effort for us to be more transparent about which posts are being rewarded. We hope that you will consider following not only this @curie account, but also many of the authors whose work is featured here each day. **Please consider adding your comments on these posts also!**\n\nProject Curie's daily curation lists will now be called \"The Daily Curie\". We hope you like the name! Future editions of The Daily Curie will [feature our new logo](https://steemit.com/curie/@kevinwong/logo-contest-for-project-curie-contest-process-and-winners-announcement). For the latest on Project Curie, do check out our [Month #1 update](https://steemit.com/curie/@curie/special-edition-major-updates-and-project-curie-month-1-roundup-12-august-11-september-2016). \n\n----------------------\n\n## Today's Brief Analysis\n\nToday's list polls all posts curated between 17:00 14/09 UTC and 17:00 15/09 UTC. Project Curie voted on a total of **103 posts** by 99 unique authors. **SBD 3,832** has been generated for authors thus far, at an average of SBD 37 per post. \n\n----------------------\n| Author     | Post       | Payout |\n| --------- | ---------- | --------- |\n| [@faddat](https://steemit.com/@faddat) | [[SYSTEMS GEEK SERIES] Roll your own Docker Platform:  Faster and cheaper than the cloud, more rebellious than legal weed!](https://steemit.com/beyondbitcoin/@faddat/roll-your-own-docker-platform-faster-and-cheaper-than-the-cloud-more-rebellious-than-legal-weed) | 616.681 SBD |\n| [@rampant](https://steemit.com/@rampant) | [Steemit Daily Drawing Tutorial - Gesture drawings (plus tool)](https://steemit.com/art/@rampant/steemit-daily-drawing-tutorial-gesture-drawings-plus-tool) | 215.310 SBD |\n| [@shenanigator](https://steemit.com/@shenanigator) | [Doing the Right Thing Will Get You Fired.

    "body": "# Is The Takeover of Crypto-Currencies About to Begin by the Central Banks?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NxCYMpy.png\n([Image Source](http://www.e-corp-usa.com/ecoin/))\n\nThe show **Mr. Robot** has fictionalized the **\"Powers that Shouldn't Be\"** into a singular Corporation called **E Corp**. This E Corp is supposed to basically represent the powers behind the Global Central Bankers, the true World Rulers. The head of E Corp even states in a recent Episode \"Politicians are Puppets\", which reminds me of the quotation by Nathan Rothschild regarding the head on which the crown of England is placed. Clearly one could see that E Corp in the show is the fictionalization of the **\"Illuminati\"** if you will. The show is heavily laden with [esoteric symbolism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2lZn-ZcJMs) but to the public it comes across as \"counter-culture\" as the main character is the founding member of **\"F Society\"** a hacking group based directly on **\"Anonymous\"**. This hacking group causes a financial crash, which leads to E Corp releasing a new digital Currency called **\"ECoin\"**, the above image is from a promotional website for the TV show. \n\n## Is Mr. Robot demonizing Crypto-Currencies? \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f6gXhrn.jpg\n([Image Source](http://www.serialminds.com/2015/06/05/mr-robot-la-serie-che-sta-piacendo-tutti-forse-troppo/))\n\nNow the interesting part for those fans of crypto-currencies like everyone on **Steemit** and for everyone who uses **Bitcoin**. I think the reason for they added an \"Ecoin\" in this show is to demonize crypto-currencies. The powers that shouldn't be have no way to take over these crypto-currencies so they have decided to wage information war against them. With the countless videos warning about the rise of *\"digital only currency\"* being the *\"mark of the beast\"*, one could easily see lots of propaganda has already been employed. However this new form is quite intelligent, by associating \"ECoins\" with \"E Corp\" they make the average mind (who doesn't know what Bitcoin or Steemit really is), subconsciously associate all crypto-currencies with the Federal Reserve banskters, with \"E Corp\". This is classic subconscious guilt by association created entirely by fiction that is often employed in fictional movies. This is why I think the \"E Coin\" was added to the show, but I could be wrong, so why else might it be in this show? \n\n## Do the Elite Plan to Replace the Dollar with a Digital Only Currency? \nhttp://i.imgur.com/IJJxcBR.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nWe all know the financial system is basically teetering on the verge of collapse. It is the biggest ponzy scheme ever devised and like all ponzy schemes if the Federal Reserve doesn't increase demand for the use of it's currency the system will collapse. It was designed to collapse. I believe like many others for one reason, so they can start the whole process that made them so rich, all over again on a global scale. The new world order if you will, being run by financial despotism and technical autocracy. So, is their plan to create a financial collapse being shown in plain sight in this show? One idea I heard from my friend who maintains the [\"What is Real\" YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/szymborski11) is they may \n>\"allow a false flag attack that they can blame on some shadowy hacking group, possibly even **Anonymous** itself as anyone can claim to be Anonymous\" \n\nPersonally I do not buy this theory as Anonymous is completely decentralized and would be almost impossible to blame for a false flag. However, to fully analyze a situation one must always look at every angle. \n\nSo if the system collapsed, especially overnight due to a hack, would they replace the Federal Reserve Notes with a new digital only \"E Coin\" backed by the IMF World Bank and their massive Gold Holdings, and Special Drawing Rights Holdings? The Group of Thirty, also known as the G30 reported in the [latest working papers on their website](http://group30.org/publications) that they want a return to a **GOLD Standard** just like how the Federal Reserve started out but in a new **Global Currency**. See my Documentary on the [\"Group of Thirty\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOB9QfxsgdQ) for more on this group of 30 Central Bankers that meet in secret. So is it out of the realm of possibilities that the new Global Currency that the World Bank has planned for post the collapse of the Federal Reserve System is a new digital only currency based on Gold and SDR holdings? No this would make a lot of sense to me but what do you the readers think? \n\n## Decentralization the Key to Defeating Takeover of Crypto-Currencies by Central Banks\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KVNo7nE.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nThe decentralized concept at the basis of the crypto-currencies could be the key to their survival if the Central Banks decide to try and take over the market. Right now their is a few crypto-currencies that are from the perspective of a non trader even worth mentioning. **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and **STEEM**, however if the Central Banks created a new \"ECoin\" it would easily make replace Bitcoin as the number 1 crypto-currency. However, there will always be a demand for crypto-currencies that are not \"Ecoins\", because thankfully we have a whole planet full of awesome people who will never conform to the system. The useless governments will always make things illegal that people want and can't buy with their new \"Ecoins\". So we will always have a demand for a currency like Bitcoin that is not a part of the centralized system, but is outside of that system's control. So try as they might, the powers that be can only wage information war against crypto-currencies because there will always be new entrepreneurs that create new currencies just like steemit, that are outside their systems of control. The harder the hidden hand squeezes the more of us will fall through their fingertips. \n\n#### Thanks for Reading! \nhttp://i.imgur.com/k10p6Pf.jpg\nIf you liked my article please join **steemit** and let me know by leaving a comment or upvoting!

    "body": "So far, a great number of applications, or tools that can considerably improve our user experience whether we are old users or new, has been created. The application directory created by @roelandp is accepted as an official directory that currently contains more than 80 various tools, mainly created by the community members, with a few official ones. The number of applications is growing rapidly, thanks to talented developers and other users, whose ideas are being converted into functional programs.\n\nHere, I want to introduce you to an infographic that contains 17 very useful tools singled out and sorted into categories according to their use. The first category 'for new and old users' contains essential applications for most users, including applications such as the official chat server and block explorer, as well as a dedicated service for uninterrupted adding of photos,  @jesta's tool for easier tracking of data related to your account, and a tool for real-time Steem Backed Dollar conversion, with a few extra applications included in the service.\n\nThe next group contains the applications essential for developers, led by @xeroc's piston which says for itself 'The Swiff Army Knife for the Steem network'. They facilitate the communication with the steem blockchain and there is also an application that facilitates the integration of Steem payments to your service. \n\nThe Miscellaneous group contains a variety of useful applications such as tools for curators, a precise browser of user reputation, a dedicated tool for creating shortened links with statistics, a Steem Stream display of all activity in real time with an option of adjusting your settings, as well as speech community and radio.\n\nLast group are applications in the category of data and analytics that contain most of data about the network, the network activity and the users. \n\nI apologize in advance if some of your favorite applications have been left out; if that is the case, you can always visit http://SteemTools.com which contains all the applications.\n\n*For a clearer view, it is recommended that you open the image in full resolution.* *[Infographic Hotlink!](http://res.cloudinary.com/powerup/image/upload/c_scale,w_1437/v1473957114/revision-02_tdjkik.png)*\nhttps://s11.postimg.io/8uxamnavn/revision_02.png\n---\n ![http://steemit.com/@powerup](https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://resources.sketch.cloud/public/102c8fee-b651-415a-8498-36de3c522b7d.png)",

Do you have favorite Steemit authors who have brought value to your life with their writing, but aren't raking in the steem dollars yet?\n\n# Incorporate TIPPING into your Steemit strategy to make Steemit a more welcoming environment and to grow the platform. #\nTips are a wonderful way to show your appreciation to your favorite Steemit authors, and to encourage new Steemians. Upvoting and commenting are a given, but sometimes you'll want to do even more to show your appreciation. By transferring just a dollar or two of SBD, along with a short message of support, you are letting the author know that their efforts are not going unnoticed, and that their voice is valuable to you.\n\nI've been tipping whenever I cash out my SBD. If I'm about to cash out $156, I will round it down to $150. Then I will use the remaining $6 to tip my favorite minnow authors. You could do it this way, or tip once a week or once a month, or just tip for a really great article whenever you find one. You could tip people for leaving really insightful comments on your own posts, as well. \n\n# Guidelines for tipping #\n\n* DON'T tip a whale, or a large dolphin. This will most likely be seen as vote-begging, and that's not cool. If you want to show your appreciation to a whale or dolphin, leave them a thoughtful comment.\n* DON'T tip with the expectation of any kind of return in mind. Just do it to show appreciation or offer encouragement.\n* DO write a brief explanation for your tip in the memo field when you perform the transfer. Something as simple as \"Here's a tip, I like your work!\" will suffice. Additionally, if you are tipping because you really loved a particular article, you could comment on that article to let the author know that you have tipped them. Otherwise the author will not know you have tipped them until the next time they check their wallet. (This can be good, too, if you want your tip to be more of a surprise.)\n\n# Your tips inspire more tips! #\nWhen you tip a new author, you are welcoming them to the Steemit community and encouraging them to keep trying. They might not be able to \"pay it forward\" right away, but once they achieve some success on Steemit, chances are they will incorporate tipping into their Steemit strategy, as well. The more people do this, the more of a welcoming environment Steemit will become to new authors, and the more Steemit will grow as a platform.\n\n# You can ask for tips, too! (Do it in a nice, friendly, lighthearted way--not a desperate or demanding way.) #\nOn many of my posts, I include a handy link at the bottom that encourages readers to tip me if they found my content valuable. I haven't received any tips yet, but that's okay. I do this more as a way to encourage a culture of tipping, than of actually getting tips (though I do love getting tipped--who doesn't?)\n\nIf you want to try this on your posts, you can build a custom link <a href=\"http://steempay.io/generate\">here.</a> It only takes a second, and then you can copy the code and paste it to the bottom of all your posts.\n\nThe really cool thing about having a digital tip jar at the bottom of each of your posts, is that ***non-Steemians*** can tip you for your work. People who find your post through Google, Facebook, or wherever. This can help monetize your content beyond the Steemit readership.\n\n# What do you think? Is tipping a good strategy for making growing the Steemit platform and making the Steemit community more welcoming? What are some other ways to do this? Let me know in the comments. #",

He couldn't figure out what was happening. All he knew that he had to stay in cover. Shootings weren't too common in Rome. In fact, this was the first in months, even years.\n\nIt was a massacre. The bullets came in through the window and wreaked havoc inside the library. When the rain of bullets stopped, Arcadius took a breath of relief with the knowledge that it would be quite a while that he would get to breathe relief again. The sight of blood was not unknown to Arcadius. He, like, many other Romans who had fought in the war of 2035* would have grown accustomed to its sight and smell. The bloodbath in the library had cost the lives of innocents, many of whom were deeply immersed in reading. Some were chatting about life itself, relishing its ups and dreading its downs. In all the chaos, something captured Arcadius' eye. I am afraid I do not know what he saw then and there, as he never told anyone. Arcadius collapsed to the floor and burst into a sob. Without a doubt, it must have been a powerful sight.\n\nThe police and the ambulances soon reached the scene of the massacre. The grilling sound of the bullets was still fresh in Arcadius' ears. The scene was burnt into his mind. The gray matter of innocent men, women, and children splattered across the floor, books, and tables. He started to repeatedly wipe the crimson blood that stained his white shirt but in vain. He was starting to fear that his head might explode.\n\n\"Are you okay, man?\" Leonidas rushed to Arcadius' side and hugged him.\n\nWith blood smeared all over his hands and white shirt, Arcadius replied, \"I'm okay.\"\n\n\"The media is going crazy with this one. Boy, the police are in some deep shit.\" Leonidas commented.\n\nAlong with the ambulances and police cars, there were cameras and TV reporters. *Their wish finally came true* Arcadius chuckled. It had been a while since anything big happened. The TV News stations mostly covered the weather, finance, celebrity gossip, and sports which had resulted in drastic fall in the ratings. This mishap gave them the very boost needed. It seemed like everybody wanted a piece of the action. For every victim, there were two reporters and cameras. A detective in black trenchcoat walked up to Arcadius, with a writing pad in one hand and a pen in the other.\n\n\"Mr... Straton. I'm Detective Caius, RPD.\" The detective pulled out a badge from the left pocket of his trenchcoat and showed it to Arcadius.\n\n\"Do you know what happened?\" The detective asked.\n\n\"I was reading this book, and ugh... all of a sudden, there was blood everywhere. I ran and took cover.\" Arcadius replied. \"Do you have any leads on who might have done it?\" He continued.\n\n\"We're working on that, sir. It'd help us a lot if you dropped by the police station.\" The detective said. Arcadius nodded in reply.\n\nAs the detective started to walk back to the crime scene, Arcadius asked, \"There was uh... the librarian. Do you know what happened to her? Her name was Axia.\" He hoped that the universe had saved him even a slither of good news. A part of him had analyzed the patterns in which the universe worked, which meant that he would have to hear something he doesn't want to.\n\nThe detective started to turn pages of his writing pad. After a few pages, he stopped at a page which seemed to have the names of all the victims. The suspense was crushed Arcadius. The detective noticed that. Perhaps, he took so long just to observe Arcadius' reaction. His grin - which seemed to be a proof of that - annoyed and angered Arcadius. Just as he was about to snap, the detective finally spoke.\n\n\"Hm... Axia. No one on this list by that name.\" The detective curiously spoke.\n\nArcadius was taken aback. He knew that he could trust his senses, but ultimately he decided to play along and said, \"Oh, nevermind.\" The detective gave Arcadius a stare and walked back to the crime scene, scribbling something on the pad. Arcadius knew that the detective had either written his name or Axia's under the *Suspects* section.\n\nLeonidas took out his vibrating Daelus Corp phone. \"Sorry, I gotta take this. I'll talk to you later.\" He said and went back to his car. Arcadius decided to walk back to his apartment which was only a few blocks down. Everyone used Daelus Corp phones, everyone that Arcadius had ever known. The Daelus Corp was leading in almost every technological field. Their phones, computers, and laptops were light-years ahead of their so-called competitors. And a thousand times cheaper. The corporation was like a conspiracy theorist's paradise. Though, their involvement with the military was far more than a mere conspiracy but still treated like one. Arcadius himself kept a flip-phone. Those were thought to be long-obsolete but were easy to find online. Perhaps he kept it as a memento of his father. Coincidentally, while pondering over the life and times of D Corp, his flip-phone vibrated. A text message from an unknown ID. *Meet me at the square at 8. Don't bring anyone.* The message read. It was equally thrilling and terrifying for Arcadius. *Who is this?* He thought to himself.\n\nAs ominous as it was, it led Arcadius to more paranoia. Arcadius was exhausted, he needed to rest. He had reached his apartment after what seemed like a decade-long day. He went up the stairs, to the right, and unlocked his apartment door.\n\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uTEQBjzP26g/UULYHWBYWAI/AAAAAAAAYyw/4M0IvR40LmI/s1600/Trevor+Tondor+modern+living+room+silver+round+coffee+table+hide+rug+blinds+Nbaynadamas.png\n\nThe apartment was an untidy mess. He stopped to admire the setting sun from the window in front of him. He remembered the bloodbath in the library, from which he had miraculously escaped unscathed. He wondered if he could fathom the pain the families of the victims must be going through. He remembered a dead body he saw in the library. *Jesus Christ, this day...* he thought to himself, dreading his luck. He lowered the white blinds on the window and wiped his tears with the tissue on the glass coffee table behind him. The kitchen was to the right while his bedroom and study were towards the left. The empty boxes of pizza, burgers, cans of soda and beer only added to his throbbing headache. He let out a sigh and went towards his bedroom. Falling down on his bed, the only thing that seemed to make sense at that moment was that he needed to fall asleep. And so he did.",

It is so addicting meeting with new people and exchanging ideas with each other and support them. So I thought it is time to support steemit as best as I can and organised steemit meetup yesterday(<strong>14th Sep</strong>, 2016) at <strong>QED42, Pune, India.</strong></p>\n<br>\n<center>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/meetuIndiaa4044.png\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1200\"/></p></center>\n<br>\n<p>It was a very <strong>amazing, cheerful and informative evening</strong>. I started with some <strong>great facts about steemit and followed by detailed explanation of Steem Power, Steem Dollars, Reputation and sharing content</strong>. I encouraged them to post only <strong>original and genuine content</strong> or otherwise they are going to get banned. I had to explain all these things because they had never heard of that kind of social media platform. <strong>All the people were like \u201cIs it for real?\u201d, \u201cHow do they get so much money?\u201d, \u201cIs there is any joining fee?\u201d and more.</strong> I answered them as best as I could and <strong>motivated them by giving example of @liberosist and how did he started and look where he is now?.</strong> The response was pretty good and I felt that they felt motivated. &nbsp;</p>\n<br>\n<center>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/20160915_1656470e974.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG-20160914-WA00058087c.jpg\" width=\"1152\" height=\"864\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG-20160914-WA0007caf12.jpg\" width=\"864\" height=\"1152\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG-20160914-WA0004e90dc.jpg\" width=\"1080\" height=\"810\"/></p>\n<br>\n</center>\n<p><strong>There are very few people from India who are using steemit</strong> and have found only 10-15 people on steemit that are from India. <strong>This is way too low percentage.</strong> It may be because most of the people have <strong>never heard of this crypto social blogging platform</strong>. <strong>Now, I have set my goals. I will bring as many people as I can to steemit from India.

Tomatoes are also now in season and so the experiment should be more than fair.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Slice the tomatoes and examine them, then squeeze them for the juice. Strain the tomatoes with a sieve and pour juice into wine glasses.

    "body": "Eight years have passed since we encountered the severe financial crisis that badly shook our economy. Back in 2008, we witnessed some of the most tiresome times for the financial markets. The last time something close to that had occurred, or even worse, was in the 1930s when the Great Depression had hit our economy. However, the economy has settled now from the adverse effects of the 2008 crisis and is behaving in a more normal manner, but what if those economic nightmares happened again? Are we prepared enough for that? Here are a few important lessons that everyone should learn from the economic crisis of 2008.\n\n1. Prepare yourself for the unexpected\nYou might have heard the saying that you should always expect the unexpected. Surely, you will never know what tomorrow may bring. You should always be ready for the uncertain events that might occur anytime. The financial markets might be stable today, but they can become unstable tomorrow. So it is essential for you to take some steps to prepare yourself.\n\n2. Don\u2019t entirely believe in the good face of the market\nDo you see too much good around you? Is there a constant rise in markets? Are loans available to everyone easily? Are interest rates continually lower than expected? You should watch out if anything like that happens. Always remember that too much good is never good for anyone. These conditions only create a false sense of security. People take more loans because of the lower interest rates and when things get back to normal, it causes a crisis.\n\n3. Always invest for long-term gains\nIf you want to live tension-free when the next financial crisis occurs, it is crucial that you start investing for long-term gains rather than short-term ones. These short-term gains might appear tempting, but they won't help you at all in the long run and not even in an economic crisis. You might not know this, but short-term investments increase the possibility of illiquidity when you need the cash, leaving you empty-handed.\n\n4. Experts know a lot but not everything\nIf you blindly believe what experts say, you might not be able to survive the crisis. We put our trust in the experts whether they were economists, stock analysts, fund managers, accounting firms, the government, industry regulators, CEOs, and what happened? They disappointed us. Not all, but surely some of them lied to us and knowingly deceived us for their personal gain and greed. The crisis of 2008 has clearly demonstrated that even the geniuses of our economy fail too. Undoubtedly, this is the best lesson from the past crises. We should not blindly trust the professionals as their predictions can be wrong and misleading.\n\n5. Make your investment approach flexible\nWhen a crisis hits, opportunities can come in various ways which you might have no idea about. This is why it's important that you have a flexible investment approach. Never get too attached to a single",

    "body": "Have you ever looked at famous entrepreneurs and wondered about the secret to their success? You might have heard a lot that people who are highly successful are the ones who are extremely motivated. It is true to some extent but not entirely. Motivation is undoubtedly necessary for everything you do, but what play a significant role in being successful are your actions and habits.\nThat's right, your actions can determine your future. If you are a person whose days are dominated by vigorous and productive practices, you are more likely to get successful. Here are some of the habits that you need to adopt to become a great entrepreneur.\n\n1. Wake Up Early in the Morning\nRising early is one of the most crucial practices that you should embrace to become a great entrepreneur. It is the time when you have clarity of mind and are fully recharged and fresh. Are you saying that you already wake up at eight in the morning? Well, when I say early in the morning, I mean way early. Most of the successful entrepreneurs wake up even before 6 a.m. You might not believe it, but Tim Cook (the CEO of Apple) wakes up at 4:30 a.m. whereas Richard Branson (founder of Virgin Group) at 05:45 a.m.\n\n2. Read as Much as You Can\nReading helps you generate new ideas, augments your ability to focus, expands and boosts your memory, improves and broadens your views, makes you more creative, and motivates you in many different ways. All of those qualities are vital for an entrepreneur. That's why you should read for at least 30 to 60 seconds in the morning or before going to bed. Even Bill Gates, a well-known entrepreneur, is a total book lover. He reads a lot every now and then. He even publishes posts on his website about book recommendations.\n\n3. Take Small but Frequent Breaks\nTaking breaks during your work will make you more energetic and involved. Most of the people who work hard day and night are more likely to get stressed and frantic. If you're thinking that an entrepreneur-in-making should stick to what they are doing and shouldn't take breaks at all, you are wrong. Adequate breaks between your work will make you more productive. It is said that most successful people work for about 60 to 90 minutes and then take a 20-minute break.\n\n4. Keep Looking for Inspiration\nNo matter how successful you are in your life, never stop seeking inspiration. Everyone has to deal with some major hindrances in their life. Sometimes, it becomes hard to overcome them as we suffer a mental roadblock. If this happens to you, you should never lose hope and look for inspiration. The best place to get inspired is watching inspirational videos on TED or reading successful entrepreneur stories or biographies. These things will help you remember to stay on track and keep doing your thing even when things appear bleak.\n\n5. Other Habits to Remember\nSome other practices to remember are to always opt for healthy meals, exercise early in the morning to kick-start your brain and body, set daily goals, follow a plan and take action, stay organized, manage your time effectively, be persistent, and always be grateful.",

    "body": "https://www.upload.ee/image/6166721/satcks700.png\nThe day starts with me heading to Steemit Headquarters, here's a quick peek.\nhttps://www.upload.ee/image/6166719/steemitofficepsd2PNG.png\n\n\"Good morning, sir\" is what my secretary tells me as I arrive to the  Steemit Headquarters and not soon after I get an annoying phone call. Having arrived at Steemit HQ I can't even sit down before @ned calls me and starts bothering me about not fluctuating the Poloniex STEEM funds, because the charts are just going crazy. But little does he know I don't have a single clue what's he talking about because I let my cryptocurrency fund manager, Stella, take care of it for me. I've been invited as a VIP quest to Capital Markets Blockchain Conference and I need to start going, @ned can wait and I'm sure the market will be just fine. If not, luckily I have plentiful hidden cryptocurrencies offshore. As I leave the office my parking valley brings up my car.\nhttps://www.upload.ee/image/6166730/STEEMBENTLEY.png\nOh look, it's a Bentley! Not to brag, but Steemit has been treating me well and I'm getting to ride this fine piece of a car for \"marketing purposes\". Just look at the custom designed interior, hand-crafted leather widgets that I can't even name. '14 Bentley Continental GT, rocksolid twin-turbo with just 616 horsepower. Yeah, it's not the most expensive car in the world, but considering I'm getting paid by Steemit to drive it then I can live with that.\n\nSpeaking of \"promotional fees\" then Steemit made me a little present, a custom made, hand-engineered by finest Switzerland  professionals, this little ol' watch, with subtle Steemit symbolics. Nothing too fancy. \nhttps://www.upload.ee/image/6166734/steemitrolex.png\nOh and yes, it's a Rolex alright. But this is no collector item, this is the only model in the world and is estimated to be valued at around 1.6 million American Dollars. But American dollars mean nothing to me, because my Steem Dollars are beating the national fiats by tenfold and it just keeps growing. What a lucky man I am to jump on the Steem board as soon I did back in '16.\n\n<h2>All the Blockchain Conferences That I'm Getting Paid To Attend</h2>\nHaving to travel often, for example to Capital Markets Blockchain Conference or The Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference afterwards, is keeping me busy and recently bought myself a little private jet, because why not?\nhttps://www.upload.ee/image/6166743/THEPLANE.png\n\nI'd love to talk more about my daily routine, it's nothing too special to be honest, but I have to get going, being a busy man myself I know that time is money or like my new motto is \"time is Steem\". \n\n<p><code>If you enjoyed this post, please </code><code><strong>FOLLOW & UPVOTE</strong></code><code> at </code><code><strong><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@modernbukowski\">@modernbukowski</a></strong></code></p>\nImage Sources: Have rights to use the stock photos, digital alternations have been made by yours truly.",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>&nbsp;Social Media these days is everything. By everything, I of course mean in terms of internet usage, it's how we connect with friends, family, coworkers, and our favorite brands. We use it to video chat over a long distance with a loved one, and to seek the opinion of our friends of what restaurants to go to when we visit a new city. It's purpose is in the name: \u201cSocial.\u201d I've talked before about the need for a more \u201chumanistic\u201d approach to blockchain technologies, and I seem to be right back at square one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On July 8th, just a week after I obtained my first chunk of Bitcoin, I was browsing headlines on my MSN news homepage (just, don't ask, OK?), and one in particular caught my eye. A Cryptocurrency was up 1000% over the week. I took a look at the article, and it talked about this thing called \u201cSteem.\u201d I looked it up, and learned it's a currency attached to a Social Media site. On that site, you can earn the currency based on people \u201cliking\u201d or \u201cupvoting\u201d your post. So I decided to take a look at it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>SteemIt is the platform. It has a fairly simple, clean, and mildly outdated UI (User Interface). There's top posts, trending posts, new posts and a few other categories. One of the easiest things to pick out is just how much people are earning on their posts. When I joined one of the posts had earned some $20,000+. Right now the highest posts seem to be around $2,000. It all seems spectacular. I mean, who doesn't want to post their thoughts and get paid for it?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/730961175182073860/AY9SsNuk_400x400.jpg\" width=\"339\" height=\"339\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Image Source: [https://twitter.com/Steemit]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This is the point where the human approach ends and the (as I said in my first article) \u201cSmart Crypto Nerd\u201d begins. SteemIt is broken into Steem (the currency), SteemDollars (the $1 parity cash out of your new digital wealth), and SteemPower (the weighted influence each user has). Each of these can be purchased, each of these can be earned and each of these works together to make the platform run. Honestly, I'm feeling overwhelmed and anxious just thinking about how these Apocalyptic 4 Horsemen of SteemIt work together to ruin your dreams of SteemIt wealth. I'm sure all the Smart Cypto folk get it and it makes perfect sense, but if you're the average Social Media user, it's too much of a mental exercise to think about how SteemPower determines how much someone earns when you up-vote their post (and when), how it also relates to how much you earn when you have your posts up-voted and just how much in SteemDollars you will earn when people up-vote your post. This doesn't even mention the fact that Steem is useless unless you're speculating (which hasn't gone too well after that 1000% gain week) or you're using it to purchase SteemPower which is really a long term investment into the system.</p>\n<p>Excuse me while I towel off. I don't know if it was the mental calisthenics or stress. From an average Joe standpoint, this gets even worse. All seemed fair and balanced when I first joined SteemIt. One of my early posts had some 4 up-votes and earned me a whopping 2 cents (in SteemDollars). I thought I was on my way up. Until a week or so later when I had a post with 8 up-votes, and it earned nothing. My first Confessions article, 14 up-votes. Earned nothing. I learned it's because of a \u201cWhales, Dolphins and Minnows\u201d tiered system based on SteemPower. Basically, Whales are \u201csuper-users\u201d with high SteemPower. Minnows are the lowest tier. If 1 whale upvotes your post, you may suddenly be at $400 SteemDollars earned and every subsequent up-vote only makes that increase. Have 20 minnows up-vote you, and you may end up with nothing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This creates a really odd dynamic. I've read of some of these Whales as being bots that automatically peruse posts and will automatically up-vote it based on a large set of criteria just as confusing as the SteemIt ecosystem. As a result, for a good while SteemIt's trending page was filled with posts lacking substance that were literally just an attractive girl saying she loved SteemIt and Bitcoin and was going to make SteemIt their source of income. It all began looking like a gigantic ruse, and I got turned off from it. Yes, I'm still using SteemIt only to post these Crypto based articles, because that's where my audience would be. That audience is the one that needs to hear this: Crypto and Blockchain technologies WILL NOT be adopted by the mainstream if it is this convoluted and confusing. I know where the idea for SteemIt came from, and the execution of that idea is poor. So I will close this with a few points of noobish advice for the folks behind SteemIt:</p>\n<p>1) Simplify- Pare down the number of \u201cSteem\u201d items. SteemPower and Steem or SteeemDollars would do. Just two.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) Decentralize- It looks like SteemIt and it's SteemPower is using Whales as an enticement (or \u201creal case\u201d advertisement). From someone not in love with the platform, it looks like Whales are used to fake results and say \u201cJoin because looks how well it works!\u201d That's the team setting that culture. They need to be more hands off in shaping usage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) Focus- Right now SteemIt is in Beta. Clarify the UI, unless its going for cheesy late 90's website, it needs to \u201cflow\u201d better. The categories are unclear, and need to be grouped under category better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4) Socialize- What's the point of social media if people aren't socially interacting? The flow needs to be more engaging between users versus being a massive posturing of \u201cHey look at my posts!\u201d Otherwise a massive re-branding is necessary and SteemIt needs to become more of a \u201cMedium\u201d of the blockchain space instead of identifying more as a \u201cReddit\u201d of blockchain technologies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a Crypto Noob, that's my take on the SteemIt platform. I'm the people you want invested in your platform, and I'm also the people you want using the platform. If you want mainstream noobs who are less savvy to researching how this all works: simplify, decentralize, focus and most importantly SOCIALIZE.</p>\n</html>",

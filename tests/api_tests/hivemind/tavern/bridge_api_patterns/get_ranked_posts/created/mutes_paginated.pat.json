    "body": "<html>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, at 5 am when the moon completes his round, the alarm rings, my deepest sleep I wake up painfully. K\u00e9ops my cat starts singing tour and stops only when he filled his mess tin. Sweety then, the cat of my son jumps on the furniture in the kitchen and also claimed his bowl. Kashmir him not to come after me, until I make him hugs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/DSCN0477faad0.jpg\" width=\"2758\" height=\"2736\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/keops0029612b.jpg\" width=\"1464\" height=\"1162\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Au-sommet81f7b.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"645\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;A small cup of coffee and I'm up for the day. After my shower, I have to feed the fish pond and two hens, they are waiting for me impatiently for me to release them from their cages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/16e3c4.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"464\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Photo0224b24a.jpg\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;6:15, I start my bag on her arm, my water bottle and my biscuit for lunch. On the road I am alone, few vehicles I meet. Great to run your car on a deserted road. In the winter when it snowed, I am the first to make tracks in the whiteness of the snow grows like cotton wool, sometimes, crazy beyond me and skids, it is an adrenaline rush. In summer the sun rises gives the sky a color of red sweetness, yellow, orange. In autumn, the trees begin to change color, it is a season because I love the beauty of trees is unique.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/d85917d4a45b3d581b5f40d1d7a7504a3bb1e.jpg\" width=\"236\" height=\"234\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Here I come down the street or is my workplace, hospital, regional hospital, the CHR. Vehicles coming after one another because we start at 7am. The staff is found, speak, tells their evening then everyone goes to the same place: the time clock, control object of our hours worked.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/chr841bd.jpg\" width=\"916\" height=\"613\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;In the ladies locker room, it gets held: white jacket with blue and green patterns representing the logo of the institution, blue pants with various pockets which we do not serve!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/DSCN1513-Copiee7a4d.jpg\" width=\"410\" height=\"681\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We arrive in our service, mine is the neurological rehabilitation service: we give up (or so) of people who have a stroke, an accident with neurological trauma, people who have multiple sclerosis or Guillain barred and other chronic diseases whose name is almost unknown.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Capture2bb0b8.jpg\" width=\"539\" height=\"627\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/370086-1f7d83.jpg\" width=\"325\" height=\"300\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Capturec0ccc.jpg\" width=\"589\" height=\"598\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We start our day with a report on each patient last night, we have 20 in service. After beginning the nursing: we make the toilet of the patient who is totally dependent. We get up in the chair. For others, we must educate, continue the actions he has learned with the therapist in the individual care, the patient should regain maximum independence so they can go home and take care only . It's a job that can last from 3 months to 6 months beyond, we can not do anything for them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/souleve-malade-foldyadb08.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Headline in this service is: you come to bed but you leave again walking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sometimes, we fail either because the patient does not want a return to autonomy, or because the patient is too ill. We give the same chance to everyone, rich, poor, alcoholic, drug addict, young or old.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The management of a patient goes from shaving the beard of a man to the presentation on the toilet, the room arrangement the carefully tended beds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Lunch arrived around 8:30 am, few patient is in the dining hall for breakfast, other unfinished eat in bed Logistical assistance serves meals that are different if the patient is diabetic, diet, dieters, old, or in solid supply resumption. You should know that when the patient has had a stroke, a stroke, swallowing is absent, which means that if the patient eats a sandwich, but he swallows the bread goes in the bronchial tubes and not in the stomach, giving a false swallowing, bronchi become infected and it's a disaster. So this patient who made false swallowing should eat while cream consistency and drink thickened liquid. Which is not very good but I admit it must go through these stages in order to re-eat a day normally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Physiotherapists arrive at 9am and leave a 17h, occupational therapists also. There is also a neuropsychologist, a speech therapist and all do work that allows the patient to regain maximum independence, which means that the patient all day is busy. Visitors can come between 14:30 and 19:30.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>After lunch, we continue our work, when all is well, we finish around 10:30 or 11am but sometimes it is noon we are still in the rooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In terms of handling, the entry of the patient, it is usually in bed or in a wheelchair with a right hemiplegia or left, some have forgotten that they had half a disabled body, so it must withstand and no wear and show him how to do with one leg to go from wheelchair to bed and vice versa. Others are completely invalid, they know not move neither arms nor legs, and for those, or we wear them either we lift them with a forklift.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>During dinner, we feed the disabled and we encode our care in the computer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Around 13h, we are a few naps after going on the toilet. Sometimes we have a problem in the pants, oops! When everyone is changed to bed, we have a service change ratio and the time, the hour of the end of our service is lagging. At 14h is the start of the morning shift. For my part, I take a good shower and I take the way home or waiting for my cats and my dog makes me a big party.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We must not believe that the nursing profession is simple, each service is different and you can not compare the care of each other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I hope I have not bothered you with this long text, I wish you a good day to you all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

It's funny how we can get so caught up in work and the business of a crazy life and miss the simply beauty along the way. Sometime you've just got to stop and smell the roses; and while you're there, take a picture!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-3-1024x768-300x225.jpeg\"/></p>\n<p>These aren't roses, I know: they're wild flowers. They don't get the nurture and care that roses do, and yet they are provided for and they bloom into beautiful blossoms in their own time. They have a harder life than others, and that's how we humans are as well. Some of us were well taken care of growing up and were treated like roses, while others were left in the field to grow up alone and without the love and care we should have had. But we are all beautiful in our own ways and if we survive long enough, we will blossom into something spectacular.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_6440-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Colorado mountain rivers</h2>\n<p>When the snow on the tops of the mountains melt, it feed the rushing rivers that carve their way down the mountainside. The climbing is excellent, the whether and the views are truly gorgeous, but something about the rivers rushing through the mountains draws you in. There is a memorization about the brave rivers unafraid of the mountains and simply rushing on by recklessly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_6031-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Mississippi at sunset</h2>\n<p>Sometimes the world just slows down and magic happens. This was one of those times. On the night before my sister's wedding in Tupelo, Mississippi the sky exploded in color. What a calm reassurance before a monumental event: the approval stamp of God upon the sanction of their marriage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_5829-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Hundreds of years old Indian hieroglyphs in Arizona</h2>\n<p>This was an incredible hike in the Arizona mountain ranges to discover a place where the Apache Indians, or perhaps some other tribe had lived hundreds of years ago!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2015-07-13-06-37-59-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Uganda, Africa at twilight, from a moving bus</h2>\n<p>Africa is always an adventure, but in 2015 we took a safari on the northern rim and caught this shot on the way back to the lodge. I love how the beauty of the world is unique in its diversity from place to place, even across the Atlantic.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_7281-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>This is one of my favorite shots. I don't remember where I took it or when, but the colors, the bliss, the peacefulness of this field of flowers was stunning. I'm glad I was able to capture an image of its beauty to remember it by. And to think, all of this beauty was made by God in a second! His power to create a world is amazing and perfect in every way. We get to see His marvelous creation every day!&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Follow me <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@ejaredallen\">@ejaredallen </a>for more pictures and great content!</h2>\n</html>",

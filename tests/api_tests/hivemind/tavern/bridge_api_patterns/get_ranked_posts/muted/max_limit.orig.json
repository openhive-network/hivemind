They are kind, generous, full of life, fun to be around and crazy creative. They are really cool people.\n\nWe have four children, Alex, Ashley, Abby and Austin. My wife's idea to name them all \"A\" names. They are referred to as the \"A Team\".\n\nWe have a close family. We argue very little and maintain open communication. We have treated them like people from early on and they have behaved as such.\n\n![Guitar](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/guitar.png 'Guitar')\n\n\n\nAn Eye Opening Experience\n-\nA few weeks ago I was in Dallas visiting a friend whom I had not seen in many years. There were other people there as well that I had also not seen in a very long time. I struck up a conversation with one of them and the discussion of family ensued. He told me about his children and what it had been like for him to become a father. He has a wonderful family with children that are still very young. When the time came for me to share about my children, I began listing off what each one was doing from the oldest to the youngest. Before I could get to the youngest one, his mouth was gaped open and he burst out, \"What are you feeding them!\" We had a big laugh as I told him about the youngest and expanded on our philosophy of family.\n\nWe have had many compliments on our children throughout their life. Even today, the people with whom they interact; family, friends and the people who work with them in stage productions, make a point of complimenting them. I am around them all the time, and many of their friends are homeschooled as well so sometimes I forget how special they are and the impact they have on others.\n\n![Railroad tracks](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/alex-railroad-tracks-600.jpg 'Railroad tracks')\n\nWhy Am I Sharing\n-\nI hope to convey a few things here. First, if you are considering homeschooling and have reservations, may these stories encourage you. If you already homeschool and wonder if it is all worth it, maybe our stories will give you hope and encouragement as well.\n\nAnd lastly, I am proud of them and want to share their success with you.\n\n![Sis](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/children-800.jpg 'Children')\n\nWhy We Homeschool\n-\nMy personal experience in public schools was a nightmare. I moved a lot when I was young and changed schools every three to six months. During one stretch of five years, I switched schools nineteen times. I did not build long term relationships and being the new kid all the time often created struggles with teachers.\n\nThere is a very long story to my history so I will not get into that here. It is however, the main reason I became excited about homeschooling when my wife suggested it.\n\nOur Oldest Child Alex\n-\n![Alex](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alexthrowback.jpg 'Alex')\n\nAlex has always been intelligent as I believe all children are. He had memorized many of the family members phone numbers and home addresses by the time he was six. We started him off in Montessori school at age four where he attended three years. We would have kept him in Montessori but they did not offer classes above six years old. \n\nAt that time my wife was still concerned about her ability to homeschool so we enrolled him in a Christian private school for one year. After that, she had researched enough to build her confidence. She was ready to go. (As the years went by, she found out that she was more than capable. We are guides.)\n\nPre-Teen\n-\n![Sis](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/alex-littlekid1.jpeg 'Alex and Sister')\n\nAlex took two years of Latin and one year of Japanese. He acted in plays and did what most children do, play a lot.\n\nTeen Years\n-\n![Sis](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/ateam.jpg 'Alex and Sister')\n\nMany people will tell you that you will have to deal with the teenage years. \"Brace yourself,\" they will say. \"You will become their enemy!\" We did not experience this with Alex or our other children. Alex would come to me for advice about issues him and his friends were discussing. When he would share how I reacted to some of our serious conversations, his friends were astonished and would respond with descriptions of their parents exploding if they attempted to have the same discussions with their parents.\n\nKeeping your cool when one of your children comes to you with a confession is a sure way to have them trust you with other issues of concern.\n\nDuring his teen years, Alex took CLEP tests and earned twelve college hours.\n\nAt sixteen, he began to gain interest in programming. I had introduced it to him when he was nine but he wasn't interested. Then again around eleven but still no interest. At sixteen, the interest was all his. Had I forced him to do it earlier, he may have never liked it.\n\n![Graduation](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/graduation.jpg 'Graduation')\n\nBecoming an Adult\n-\n![Alex](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/alex-adult1.jpeg 'Alex')\n\nOne his eighteenth birthday, he begin working his first job as a software developer. He was hired as an apprentice and was promoted to junior developer after only three months. At that time, he began mentoring two of his friends. Within a few months he had taken on a third person to mentor. Within a year or so, each of them have now changed their path and work as software developers. It has significantly changed their lives. Alex just recently began mentoring another friend. Pretty cool to pass forward. He had received help from some of my co-workers early on which made all the difference in his progression.\n\nHe now speaks French and Mandarin and has aspirations to learn many more. He has traveled to seven countries and has an arrangement with his employer to work from anywhere in the world as long as he is at the office for part of the year.\n\n![Alex](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/amsterdamcollage.jpg 'Alex')\n\nHe gives technical talks at local meet ups, plays both acoustic and electric guitar, has never met a stranger and has made no enemies.\n\nHe is an inspiration to others, his family and siblings. The bar has been set high but the other children have many interests and accomplishments of their own. I'll share those in subsequent posts.\n\n![Leon](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/leoncollage.jpg 'Leon')\n\nWhat was our part?\n-\nMy wife has worked hard to keep them supplied with good school material, staying compliant with state requirements and providing some structure for learning. We never set up a school room like environment. There are never set hours of study. Homeschooling hours vary depending on the age of the child and what they are working on at that phase of their education. I would say that most of the time they spend less time doing actual school work and the rest of the time exploring, using their imagination and focusing their energy on things they are interested in.\n\nFor Alex, that was a foreign language. Other times it was memorizing all the Pokemon cards and building decks and playing in tournaments. Alex said one of the things that has helped him so much in learning new things was the fact that he had memorized so much Pokemon data. He developed the ability to store and retrieve things in his mind.\n\nThe simple fact is\u2026 we didn't do it. Alex did. He deserves all the credit. He did all the work. We provided the canvas, the paint and the paintbrushes. \n\nConclusion\n-\nI feel we have a pretty cool family. There are many ways to raise your children. The most important thing is to love them unconditionally, give them room to grow and treat them as you would your very best friend. They are people and are smarter than most give them credit.\n\nI hope I have been able to convey how proud we are of Alex. These are but a few highlights of his life as he is only twenty-one. There is so much in store for him.\n\nI am so grateful that as much as possible we have given Alex the opportunity to live life on his own terms and he has flourished.",

Through time writers of all kinds being the sensitive, emotional and deep people that they are, have always associated the rain with loneliness. Today, whenever a cold wind blows through an open window or an empty space on a street, we are swept with its glum, warning us of a heavy feeling, reminding us of what we have lost, memories that are only too sad we almost wish could bury everything in a shroud of oblivion. Regrets come again, as well as faces of people from the past as a teardrop suddenly threatens to fall anytime from already lost and almost hollow eyes. The cold brought by the rain along with the dark clouds lurking outside makes us want to wrap our arms protectively around ourselves to keep us warm or to shut out any sad thoughts that dare to overstep the arms engulfing our curled bodies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/6iwlyw.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But its not always like that. Not if we can help it, no. The Rain is perceived negatively most of the time but we can care enough to see beyond what is often seen. GO, outside on an early September morning and you will see that the rain leaves a magnificent dew drenched flower or a grass all the more alive as the sunlight hits the few drops left from last night's rain. All for you to behold. See that under umbrellas are faces of people smiling and radiant as you meet them on the street. Really, the rain cant be that bad. Not at all. It is natures gift, a gift from the Almighty. And after a rain, what do the heavens hold for you? An array of colors painting the sky and we know it as rainbow. Just as we know that after the tears, laughter comes, making us very much worthy of the joy because of what we have gone through.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/fnzjtl.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>All our days cannot simply be filled with sunshine and it cannot be simply all laughter and smiles. We have to grow as a person just as the rain lets the flowers in the meadow bloom and grow. The flowers need the rain just as much as they need sunshine. Same is true with people. We need to be happy just as we need to be lonely so that we can grow as a person. Then can we only bring ourselves to realize that the bad is not so bad afer all as long as we allow the growth it brings to us as individuals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/16kp014.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>You cannot escape the rain, nor chase it away. Dare to hear its pitter patter rhythm as something which can never be a hindrance for you to see things in a different and brighter way no matter how dark the clouds and heavy the downpour. It is as inevitable as the troubles we come across. Learn from the rain because it is the law of nature. Learn from loneliness or troubles because... It is the law of life.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>(c) to the owner of the picture I used...</p>\n</html>",

Don't they know what harm soda is and all the things that are wrong with pacifiers!\" Then I had children. We have four. It was a lot harder than I thought it would be. When children are very young, you cannot reason with them. You cannot get through to them with logic.\n\nI hope you continue on Steemit and share your experiences with your children. You do have children, right?\n\nI love the concepts being presented by this an other posts to raise our children and never discipline them but what I am not seeing are examples of how to do that. Not once they are old enough to reason, between 4 and 6, but before that.\n\nI am a strong opponent to child abuse. I grew up in a **very** unstable home. That was something I did not want and did not do in my own family but each of my children did receive a few spankings when they were very young. Once they were old enough to reason with, we discussed matters and consequences came into play.\n\nI have a post on my oldest son, he is 21 now and I talk about homeschooling and letting children play a large role in their life. It is __their__ life after all.\n\nhttps://steemit.com/life/@craigwilliamz/how-to-raise-fantastic-children-part-1",

There is nothing wrong about that, but whale @smooth decided to flag me, destroying my reputation and so my ability to greet new steemians. Just look at the messages on my introductory post and you will see how much I was apreciated for this initiative: no one complained.\n\nThis is unfair! Flagging me as if I were a \"bot\" is an insult to the time I took to salute each new steemian I could.\n\nNo one complained about me and only positive reactions from new steemians is what you could read (if my reputation wasn't destroyed by @smooth). So what kind of \"spam\" is the one that makes people happy when they are personaly greeted when they join (and how could this be compared with an \"spambot\", it's my time that was there dedicated for this task). What is the problem if I found time to do this \"repetitive\" task?\n\n@steemwelcome",

    "body": "Come on, now.  Your life isn't ruined.\n\nYou're just playing a game on yourself called \"temptation, judgment and withdrawal,\" we've all done it - it's human nature; it's part of the cycle of life to know what we want and to have things \"perfect\" for a time, only to have those things taken away in more time, you see.\n\nIn reality, you're blessed.  You're beautiful both outside (which is very apparent from your photo, btw) and on the inside.  You say that the real self is ugly, but it really isn't.\n\nYou see, you were conditioned to identify with the archetype of satan; to associate yourself with that part of you which is \"animal\" (instinct) and to judge that side of yourself as \"bad\" and \"wrong\".  But it really isn't bad at all.  In fact, it's just as natural and good as any other \"part\" of ourselves.\n\nSelfishness isn't bad.  Greed isn't bad.  On the flip side, selflessness isn't good.  You're just **here**, being aware of actions happening to you, around you, and \"coming out from you\".  The selfishness or selflessness that you observe coming out from you are just **here** for you to witness, just like everything else that \"happens\" to you.  You aren't them.  You're not even the energy of their engagement.\n\nYou're the joy and compassion that embraces the witnessing and the judging and the condemning and the pleasures and the pains and the attachments and the losses - a non-personal, all-embracing witness to all these waves and cycles of good and bad, happy and sad - you see.\n\nYou're greater than that which you perceive.  You're beyond the suffering that you observe inside of yourself and outside, in the world that your body interacts with.\n\nYou're the non-judgmental, ever-peaceful and content, presence that underlies all the complex (ego) games of your conditioned consciousness, which is your ever-present means to psychological healing and the absolute forgiveness of your apparent sins.\n\nCan you feel it?  Can you sense the truth and power of these words that I share here?\n\nIf you can let go of your attachment to suffering and punishing yourself for being less than perfect, then you will immediately feel peace and space fill your awareness.  The words that I speak here only help to direct your attention there.  I'm not doing anything to you, nor are you doing anything to yourself.  You're simply releasing from effort and restricting your energies and this great sense of peace and contentment is the natural consequence of doing this.\n\nNow, see if you can look on yourself with shame or anger.  See if you can look on others with pity, jealousy or resentment.  Notice how the energies associated with these types of feelings and emotions may still be present inside of your awareness, but how you no longer feel attached to them or judgmental towards them - they no longer feel like they ARE you.\n\nRather, these emotions, or energies that evoke strong memories and make inner-resistances to a healthy flow of energy very apparent, are a \"happening\", no different from a car passing you by on the street.  You always have the choice to attach a lot of meaning in these \"passer-bys\", whether it be the car in my recent analogy or the emotions, but you also have the choice to ignore them and/or allow them to be as they are.\n\nIt's the allowing of things to be as they are which provides us with insight as to who we really are, you see...and I assure you that it is in no way ugly.",

Ingress and Pok\u00e9mon Go are the latest examples of gamification done right.

    "body": "https://i.imgsafe.org/a633508263.jpg\n**There's no good way to introduce myself. I'm a 20 year-old woman, I\u2019m between the cracks, I\u2019m a slave, forced into whoring myself, a victim of what is usually called \u201chuman trafficking.\u201d There's no way I can escape from this without harm coming to my family, I\u2019m not here for pity. This is the life I'm stuck in, and I'm making the best of it, day by day. The last year, though has been much better than expected.\nI began reading this reddit with interest in 2012, and in 2013 (first buy was at $43), began coordinating meets downtown with people selling local. (Nice guys, every one of them wanted to rescue me, really sweet (if any of you are reading this, thank you)) and I'd exchange a small portion of my night's cash for bitcoins.\nI had one seller who began to meet me regularly, act like an ordinary John on until we got to the room, and then just educate me for the hour about bitcoin. These sessions are some of my happiest memories from the past 2 years. He even paid/tipped me for my time after teaching me! Some in cash, only a little in bitcoin: kept the management from growing suspicious. always still mostly taking home cash) I trusted him enough to hold my bitcoin for me, to keep any evidence of what I was doing off my phone. He was truly a good samaritan. In this way I managed to put about 10% of my earnings away every month. I don't have to tell you how smart and lucky I felt come December.\nI sent 22 BTC home that month (around $750 exchange rate) to help pay off a portion of my parent's debt. If this was taken home as cash, almost 2/3 of it would have gone to management \"expenses.\" Once I've finished covering their debt, I plan to save to purchase my freedom and be through with the business. This should be in about a year. I've recently begin to understand basic margin trading, and I suspect that, even with my extremely limited computer access, I could turn a profit on the bitcoin i already have by opening a 3:1 buy when I feel btc has dipped close to low.\nI had some rare free time and II wanted to thank you, users of this subreddit, for helping educate me about bitcoin and, in turn, helping me to get my parent's life back on track as soon as possible. If I'm living a different life in a year, I'll have you all to thank. I bet this all sounds tragic, but it\u2019s reality, and I'm doing much better than I ever imagined. I thought you would be happy to know how it has has positively affected my life & my parents.**\n\nFrom 2014 it was a whole new kind of experience it was a smooth sailing until my mom got admitted for breast cancer\ni will be posting about myself a lot over here about what all i have went through in the next post\n\nhere is the link to my reddit story which was well received by the wonderful community  \n**https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2keueb/my_thanks_to_you_all_bitcoin_has_changed_my_life/**\n\ni would love to stay here and be a part of this community\nLets steem!!",

To date, it has polarized blockchain experts while&nbsp;winning scores of newcomers to the technology.The brain-child of Daniel Larimer, founder of <a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/bitshares-decentralized-exchange-crypto-2-0/\">BitShares</a>, and Ned Scott, a former financial analyst, Steemit aims to provide a place for individuals to create content, promote&nbsp;the content they believe is good and comment on stories \u2014 all while earning money.</p>\n<p>But Steemit is more than just a website for earning spare change.It\u2019s an actual blockchain built on a piece of technology developed by Larimer called Graphene, which allows for the deployment of application-specific blockchains.Scott, in interview with CoinDesk, explained that the team only had the idea for Steemit back in January and, because of the Graphene framework, they were able to quickly roll the project out.</p>\n<p>The rest, like most things in the blockchain space, is a bit difficult to explain.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The pop</h2>\n<p>For the first few months,&nbsp;there <a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/facebook-user-controlled-social-media-blockchain/\">wasn\u2019t much</a> talk about Steemit.While there were early miners and people contributing content, the real big bang didn\u2019t come until&nbsp;4th July. When the dam opened, $1.3m worth of stored-up blockchain-based currency called \"steem\" was released to those that had been participating on the platform.</p>\n<p>Scott explained that, while all of the blog posts, comments and upvotes that had occurred on the site pre-July 4th were all on the blockchain, the rewards users had been promised for their contributions had not been distributed. The underlying idea was that the team wanted to continue testing the platform, finding bugs and fixing them prior to a rush of new people signing up.</p>\n<p>He cautioned that, no matter how diligent the development team is, there are going to be bugs and that they wanted to ensure that Steemit was safe and secure for everyone.Nevertheless,&nbsp;4th July&nbsp;was a day that they had all been looking forward to.</p>\n<p>Scott said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And with that pop, users who had been watching their balances rise were instantly rewarded.</p>\n<h2>One currency, two smart contracts</h2>\n<p>Part of the confusion with Steemit lies in the different ways that the currency is presented to users.</p>\n<p>At the root is the currency Steem, which is the typical transferrable, fungible, freely moveable token akin to bitcoin, ethereum or any other cryptocurrency.&nbsp;But that same Steem can be put into two different types of smart contracts depending on the particular utility an individual wants.The first is called Steem Power, which provides utility and leverage. Steem Power is the backbone of an account's voting-potential. In other words, the more Steem Power an individual has, the stronger their vote is on Steemit.</p>\n<p>Scott explained that the team wanted to provide a mechanism by which individuals could take a long-term interest in the project, while allowing others to continue with their speculation.&nbsp;In the white paper, Steem Power is compared to long-term capital commitments, similar to what a venture capitalist might do.While users can invest their money instantly, there is an expectation that it will take time to see a return on that investment.</p>\n<p>In the case of Steem Power, should a user want to convert back to the base currency of Steem, it will need to occur in 104 weekly conversions.The second smart contract is called Steem Dollars. This is a debt-like instrument that promises to distribute $1 worth of Steem to the token holder at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>Scott explained:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;This seven-day conversion process is meant to minimize the ability to create arbitrage attacks by market timers. If the Steem Dollars were convertible to Steem immediately, a user could take advantage of a difference in price, convert their Steem Dollars into regular Steem and earn more than the $1 worth the smart contract intended for it.</p>\n<p>Because it is a stable debt instrument, users who hold Steem Dollars miss out on any Steem price increases. If Steem is worth $1 and this conversion took place, the individual would receive 1 Steem for every Steem Dollar they owned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;If Steem rose to&nbsp;$2, the individual would receive 0.5 Steem for every Steem Dollar they owned.To compensate for the locked value, Steem Dollars accrue interest.&nbsp;At time of story, users that hold Steem Dollars will earn 10% a year in interest, paid out in Steem Dollars.</p>\n<h2>Rewards for writing and curating</h2>\n<p>There are two methods of earning Steem on Steemit.The first is by writing a blog post. As that blog post accrues votes, the amount of Steem that will be distributed to the writer increase.</p>\n<p>However, every vote on the site is not worth a flat amount of money.&nbsp;Instead, the amount earned is based on both the number of votes an individual receives and the amount of Steem Power a voter has.For example, if one user had 1,000 Steem Power and another had 10,000 Steem Power, it's clear that the latter has a more powerful account than the former. The effect of each of those two people voting on a piece of content is not equal; specifically, the user with 10,000 Steem Power's&nbsp;vote is worth more.</p>\n<p>This has resulted in the development of a sort of whale chasing culture, whereby writers hope to convince the large Steem Power holders to give them upvotes. A vote by Scott or Larimer has been seen to increase the value of a post by hundreds of dollars, resulting in a pile-on effect where others chase the post.To incentivize this sort of voting, there is also the curation reward paid out in the form of Steem Power. If a post does well, you earn more Steem Power than if a post doesn\u2019t do well, thus incentivizing you to only vote for content that you believe is high quality.</p>\n<p>Further, not every vote from the same account is equal in value. Voting on multiple pieces of content reduces the strength of each of your votes depending on how much time passes&nbsp;between each vote. Scott explained voting power by comparing it to certain video games.</p>\n<p>He said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;There are two reward pool distributions.</p>\n<p>The first is approximately 12 hours after the post has been submitted. The reward, denominated in US dollars, is released to the writer divided evenly&nbsp;between Steem Power and Steem Dollars. Voters&nbsp;receive the reward entirely in Steem Power. The second reward pool distribution occurs one month later.</p>\n<h2>Delegated proof-of-stake</h2>\n<p>A blockchain without security is not one anyone would have faith in.Steemit gains its security from&nbsp;a delegated proof-of-stake algorithm, first developed for Larimer's BitShares project, which is a variation of proof-of-stake.&nbsp;A true proof-of-stake algorithm, such as<a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/how-peercoin-got-a-boost-from-bitcoins-halving/\">peercoin</a>, relies on those who hold&nbsp;the currency to verify transactions.</p>\n<p>The more currency held by a wider variety of people, the more secure the network is.In a delegated proof-of-stake system, the community votes for individuals, called witnesses, to be responsible for verifying transactions.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to think about it is proof-of-stake is true democracy similar to ancient Athens. Delegated proof-of-stake is more of a democratic republic, such as the US. By that logic, witnesses are like Congressmen, elected by the community to be responsible for securing the network.</p>\n<p>However, the analogy ends there, because witnesses can be kicked out of their job for not doing it, something the US Congress has been immune to for some time.</p>\n<p>Scott said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In total, there are 21 witnesses responsible for creating and signing blocks of transactions each time a block is made. The first 19 are voted for, as described above. Then there is a 20th witness, which is a random witness who might not have been in the top 19. The 21st witness is a miner doing typical proof-of-work.</p>\n<p>In the Steemit white paper, the authors write:&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>New, but growing</h2>\n<p>Since catapulting in value to over $400m, Steem has cooled to an approximate market-cap of $157m, but this still makes it one of the six largest cryptocurrencies on the space.While there are certainly naysayers, the reality is that Steemit continues to see more people signing up and participating.</p>\n<p>However, it\u2019s not simply Steemit the social media site, but also the blockchain that has experienced tremendous growth. Scott said that entrepreneurs and developers have already created 50 different tools, such as Catch a Whale (which tracks where whales have recently voted) and SteemMarket (which lets users buy, sell and&nbsp;rent goods with Steem).</p>\n<p>Ned said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Whether they stick around past the excitement, though, remains to be seen.If the stories of people paying off bills, buying family members washing machines and going on vacations is any indication, Steemit might have found a niche for content creators looking for ways to generate income.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/WisdomPlanet/wisdomtimes/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Qualities-of-a-mother-and-her-transformation.jpg\n\n\"The evolution of a Mother, in spite of its half\u2212humorous, half\u2212sacrilegious sound, is a serious study in Biology. Even on its physical side this was the most stupendous task Evolution ever undertook. It began when the first bud burst from the first plant\u2212cell, and was only completed when the last and most elaborately wrought pinnacle of the temple of Nature crowned the animal creation.\n\nWhat was that pinnacle? There is no more instructive question in science. For the answer brings into relief one of the expression\u2212points of Nature one of these great teleological notes of which the natural order is so full, and of which this is by far the most impressive. Run the eye for a moment up the scale of animal life. At the bottom are the first animals, the Protozoa. The Coelenterates follow, then in mixed array, the Echinoderms, Worms, and Molluscs. Above these come the Pisces, then the Amphibia, then the Reptilia, then the Aves, then What? The Mammalia, THE MOTHERS. There the series stops. Nature has never made anything since.\n\nIs it too much to say that the one motive of organic Nature was to make Mothers? It is at least certain that this was the chief thing she did. Ask the Zoologist what, judging from science alone, Nature aspired to from the first, he could but answer Mammalia Mothers. In as real a sense as a factory is meant to turn out locomotives or clocks, the machinery of Nature is designed in the last resort to turn out Mothers. You will find Mothers in lower Nature at every stage of imperfection; you will see attempts being made to get at better types; you find old ideas abandoned and higher models coming to the front. And when you get to the top you find the last great act was but to present to the world a physiologically perfect type. It is a fact which no human Mother can regard without awe, which no man can realize without a new reverence for woman and a new belief in the higher meaning of Nature, that the goal of the whole plant and animal kingdoms seems to have been the creation of a family, which the very naturalist has had to call Mammalia.\n\nThat care for others, from which the Mammalia take their name, though reaching its highest expression there, is introduced into Nature in cruder forms almost from the dawn of life. In the vegetable kingdom, from the motherlessness of the early Cryptogams, we rise to find a first maternity foreshadowed in the flowering tree. It elaborates a seed or nut or fruit with infinite precaution, surrounding the embryo with coat after coat of protective substance, and storing around it the richest foods for its future use. And rudimentary though the manifestation be, when we remember that this is not an incident in the tree\u2019s life but its whole blossom and crown, it is impossible but to think of this solicitude and Motherhood together. So exalted in the tree\u2019s life is this provision for others that the Botanist, like the Zoologist, places the mothering plants at the top of his department of Nature. His highest division is the Phanerogams named, literally, in terms of their reproductive specialization.\n\nCrossing into the animal kingdom we observe the same motherless beginning, the same cared\u2212for end. All elementary animals are orphans; they know neither home nor care; the earth is their only mother or theinhospitable sea; they waken to isolation, to apathy, to the attentions only of those who seek their doom. But as we draw nearer the apex of the animal kingdom, the spectacle of a protective Maternity looms into view. At whatprecise point it begins it is difficult to say. But that it does not begin at once, that there is a long and gradual Evolution of Maternity, is clear. From casual observation, and from popular books, it might be inferred that care of offspring we cannot yet speak of affection is characteristic of the whole field of Nature. On the contrary, it is doubtful whether in the Invertebrate half of Nature it exists at all. If it does it is very rare; and in the Vertebrates it is met with only exceptionally till we reach the two highest classes. What does exist, and sometimes in marvellous perfection, is care for eggs; but that is a wholly different thing, both in its physical and psychical aspect, from love of offspring. The truth is, Nature so made animals in the early days that they did not need Mothers. The moment they were born they looked after themselves, and were perfectly able to look after themselves. Mothers in these days would have been a superfluity. All that Nature worked at at that dawning date was Maternity in a physical sense Motherhood came as a later and a rarer growth. The children of those days were not really children at all; they were only offspring, springers off, deserters from home. At one bound they were out into life on their own account, and she who beg at them knew them no more. That early world, therefore, for millions and millions of years was a bleak and loveless world. It was a world without children and a world without Mothers. It is good to realize how heartless Nature was till these arrived.\n\nIn the lower reaches of Nature, things remain still unchanged. The rule is not that the Mother ignores, but that she never sees her child. The land\u2212crabs of the West Indies descend from their homes in the mountains once a year, march in procession to the sea, commit their eggs to the waves, and come away. The burying\u2212beetles deposit their fragile capsules in the dead carcase of a mouse or bird, plant all together in the earth, and leave them to their fate. Myriads of other creatures are born into the world, and ordained so to be born, whose Mothers are dead before they begin to live. The moment of birth with the Ephemeridae is also the moment of death. These are not cases nevertheless where there has been no care. On the contrary, there is a solicitude for the egg of the most extreme kind for its being placed exactly in the right spot, at the right time, protected from the weather, shielded from enemies, and provided with a first supply of food. The butterfly places the eggs of its young on the very leaf which the coming caterpillar likes the most, and on the under side of the leaf, where they will be least exposed a case which illustrates in a palpable way the essential difference between Motherhood and Maternity. Maternity here, in the restricted sense of merely adequate physical care, is carried to its utmost perfection. Everything that can be done for the egg is done. Motherhood, on the other hand, is non\u2212existent, is even an anatomical impossibility. If a butterfly could live till its egg was hatched which does not happen it would see no butterfly come out of the egg, no airy likeness of itself, but an earth\u2212bound caterpillar. If it recognized this creature as its child, it could never play the Mother to it. The anatomical form is so different that were it starving it could not feed it, were it threatened it could not save it, nor is it possible to see any direction in which it could be of the slightest use to it. It is obvious that Nature never intended to make a Mother here; that all that she desired as yet was to perfect the first maternal instinct. And the tragedy of the situation is that on that day when its training to be a true Mother should begin, the butterfly passes out of the world.\n....\"\n\nFrom:\nTHE LOWELL LECTURES ON THE ASCENT OF MAN\nby HENRY DRUMMOND\nhttp://www.searchengine.org.uk/ebooks/12/4.pdf",

While the reasons for swapping shoes for slippers before entering the home have changed, the result is still a cleaner floor.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Significance</h2>\n<p>When traveling to countries with different traditions and cultures other than your own, it is important to remember to be considerate and respectful of those traditions and their significance to the culture you are visiting. In Japan, it is considered very disrespectful to wear shoes inside of a home and, in some cases, businesses as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Reason Why</h2>\n<p>According to some sources, the tradition of removing shoes is related to the climate of Japan. As it is a country that experiences heavy rainfall, roads and sidewalks are often wet and muddy. To track this muddy mess into another's home would be less than thoughtful if the visitor understood that many Japanese use rooms for more than one purpose; for example, futons may be laid on the living room floor at night for sleeping.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>In Practice</h2>\n<p>Remove your shoes when in the genken, or entryway, to a home. In practice, remove your shoes so that you are still pointing in the direction in which you entered the home. Then kneel and turn them around and move them to the side to allow easy access to the door for anyone else who may be arriving. It is important to note that in Japanese culture it is a sign of disrespect to show your back to your host.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Once Inside</h2>\n<p>Generally, a pair of house slippers will be waiting nearby for you to put on when in the home. Even the house slippers must be taken off to step on to tatami, or floor mats, in the home to protect them from damage and dirt. Additionally, when using a restroom, house slippers are removed and a different pair, just for using the restroom, are used.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>In Other Cultures</h2>\n<p>Removing one's shoes at the door as a sign of respect to a host is not a tradition confined to Japan. It also exists in Thailand and the Czech Republic and has migrated into many Western countries.&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

That begs the question, as to why are we only reading about Steemit, why are our lives not being enriched by content that is suppose to be valuable to us as Humans?</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Buzz is the word we are looking for here.</p>\n<p>Here Is How It Works.</p>\n<p>The Founders need to encourage new posts, so you may get an upvote from them. Reward you with your introduction and efforts. You are hooked!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Whales and the Founders want to gain more attention on the platform - they are invested and they in turn protect their investments. So, naturally so - they are going to like anything that puts the platform into the public eye.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The authors who attempt to write compelling content need to re-invest into the system to power up their accounts so they begin to become a whale themselves.

Even this POST is an example of what I'm talking about.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Premise</p>\n<p>The premise of this network is for content to be awarded upon providing value to the readers. Right now, the greatest value that can be provided to the community is that of spreading the word about the community. This is what the founders want, the whales and without you even knowing it. It is actually what you want.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>So, spread the word.

    "body": "<html>\n<p><img src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/6xugi9.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Though considered common eats among many Filipinos, there are still those who have yet to pluck up the courage to try <em><strong>balut</strong></em>. <em>Balut</em> is a fertilized duck egg, either 16 or 18 days old, which has been boiled and is eaten with salt or vinegar. Though the almost-fully-formed duckling inside the egg can be off-putting to some, <em>balut</em> is a tasty afternoon treat all over the Philippines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/2450ojn.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>How to Make Balut</strong><br>\n1. Select eggs that are fit for incubation. Eggs should come from mated flocks, and be not more than five days old. They should have thick shells without any cracks.</p>\n<p>2. Preheat the selected eggs under the sun for three to five hours.</p>\n<p>3. Heat some unpolished rice in an iron cauldron or vat until it reaches a temperature of about 42 to 42.5 degrees C (107 to 108 degrees F).</p>\n<p>4. Put 100 to 125 eggs into a large cloth made of either abaca (sinamay) or nylon.</p>\n<p>5. Place a layer of heated rice at the bottom of a cylindrical bamboo incubator basket (45 cm in diameter and 60 cm deep), and place a bag of eggs on the rice. Alternate the bags of eggs with the bags of heated rice. Eight bags of eggs will fit into the basket. Bamboo baskets can be arranged either in a single row along the wall of the balutan, or in double rows placed in the middle of the balutan. Rice hull is firmly tamped down between baskets as an insulator.</p>\n<p>6. Turn the eggs at least two or three times a day.</p>\n<p>7. Heat the rice in the morning and in the afternoon on cool days.</p>\n<p>8. Candle the eggs on the 7th, 14th and 18th day to select infertile eggs; D1 (dead embryo on first candling) and D2 (dead embryo on second candling). The infertile eggs, both D1 and D2, are removed, hard-boiled, and sold as a snack.</p>\n<p>9. Eggs containing a normal embryo candled on the 16th to 18th day should be hard boiled and sold as balut<br>\n</p>\n<p>If you go in the Philippines, dont forget to try this food.</p>\n</html>",

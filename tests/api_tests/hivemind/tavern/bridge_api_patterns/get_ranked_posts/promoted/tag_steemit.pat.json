    "body": "# Happy September. #\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/3wokqy0mf/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s15.postimg.org/3jx6kricr/image.jpg' border='0' alt='image'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/'>\n\n**I know others on this website have said this, so I'm not the first, but yeah, I quit my job to write for Steemit.** \n\nActually, though, that's not entirely true. It's kind of true. I quit my job because something shifted inside of me. When the job was gone, Steemit, on the selfsame day, rose up into my focus immediately to fill the void like it was just waiting for me to finally get real. To do this stuff I've always been wanting to do. And always *have been doing* at the expense of sleep, money, time, etc. I was now beginning to get *paid for it.* What the!?!\n\n**The first half of August was bliss.** After some initial discouragement, I found some good verbs in the mouth of one Sterlin Luxan, and was inspired to actually dig down inside of myself and make a more [honest post.](https://steemit.com/steemit/@kafkanarchy84/why-i-have-quit-five-jobs-in-the-past-six-years-a-steemit-confessional) I finally made twenty bucks on the site. From there I thought, hell, I'll just do this full time. I began to make significant sums of cash for an honest day's worth of work writing, and felt that with my side job,  as long as I hammered down, I would be able to cover my family's usual expenses by the time September rolled around.\n\n\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/wk9d1kjsx/image.jpg\n*Spending time with my son has been one of the biggest bonuses of leaving my 9-5.*\n# **Well. August 31st. Paying all my bills with SBDs? No such luck, my friend.** # \n\nBut I will tell you one thing. I never dreamed I could pull down 2Gs cold, hard cash through writing in less than a month, even if one half of it is still vested in Steem Power (I am happy about this). I was sick to my stomach, though. I have a wife and a child. Playing games at this point was not an option. Still....I had heard something that was very lovely and very clear.\n\nIt was a kind of feeling I have never had before, but which was also at once very perfectly familiar. As my kid is playing on the Octopus slide behind me, and I am staring out at the sea, it hits me:  ***It's over. You will never teach kids again.***\n\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/4xqdopsip/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s16.postimg.org/dfztt1z1h/image.jpg' border='0' alt='image'/><br />\n\n**Weird. It's like my wish, but this time I am not even wishing for it. It comes to me. I just know that that chapter of my life is completed. That was the day after I quit my job.**\n\n**Fast forward to the end of the month.** I haven't made enough money like I had hoped....I pray to someone or something over my Matsuya beef bowl in the sketchy back alley district of the burlesque dancers: *what should I do?* I was really, really feeling low and full of doubts and self-accusations.\n\nImmediately that silly voice came back again: \n # *(Keep doing what you're doing)* #\n\nI haven't been eating this month. Haven't been sleeping. Have had headaches. Upset stomach. Welcome to fear. Welcome to the real shit. You were so cocky! Are you lazy!? You didn't like your job but so what!? You've got a family!!! Son comes home from daycare. *DAAAAADDDYYYYYY!!!!!!! Let's play!!!!!*\n\nPull yourself together.\nDon't show your frayed nerves.\n\n**My wife is equally worried.**\nShe needs security. She wants to get into massage. Vocal training school. So many dreams. Here I am sitting around the house in my underwear when all I really want to do is hand her a big fat envelope full of money.\n\nhttps://s17.postimg.org/56h7g4qxb/image.jpg\n\n**I've never been lazy. I will work my ass off when I care, and when I need to.** Fuck sleep. Fuck food. Fuck everything but the goal. \n\n# I just can't seem to give a damn about most shit that everybody else says is important. #\nWell, a lot of shit, at least. Still. Mouths to feed, my friend. But that \"voice,\" didn't it mean something? And despite the nerves, hasn't this been one of the happiest, most productive months of my life? Yes. Yes, and yes. Besides, the other job was no good. Bad, unsustainable situation. You know that, Graham.\n\nhttps://s15.postimg.org/i7lfk6hzv/image.jpg\n*My buddy Kevin shows up to the Local.*\n\n**Back to now, August, 31st, 2016. Evening. I went to my friend Craig's bar tonight.** At the depth of my despair, on the bus ride over, I received a mail from my other friend, Aidan. There might be some part time work at his school. Mail sounds promising. \n\nAfter a couple beers at Craig's place it is settled I will work Saturdays mixing booze and playing guitar. I am starting to feel good again. It is starting to seem possible that I can build my own, full-time, part-time \"Steem-lance\" schedule. [Fake priest weddings](https://steemit.com/religion/@kafkanarchy84/my-life-as-a-fake-priest-true-believer), English classes, serving beer and singing....and....\n\n# STEEEEEEEEEEEEMMMMMM!!!!!!! #\n\nAnd you know what? \n\nI am going to document it every step of the way. This is the first episode. Hope to see you next time, from my first day on the job as a bartender. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/jasziAzaiZ4\n\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/rjlhw49rp/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s18.postimg.org/aj2lnfwqh/image.jpg' border='0' alt='image'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/'>\n\nhttps://s17.postimg.org/yb9pkx39b/image.jpg\n*Basically how I feel now that I have discovered Steemit.com*\n\nPeace, Love, and Anarchy,\n\n~KafkA\n\nP.S. Another thing I have never been good at is keeping a consistent diary. I'm too private, and can't be bothered, even for myself. Should \"My Steemit Life\" transform into an existentialist thought stream ramble resembling a blog-turned-extended-acid trip, please forgive me. Maybe I will commit to  5 episodes. That sounds like a good number to me. Deal?\n\n***\n*Graham Smith is a Voluntaryist activist residing in Niigata, Japan.*",

That\u2019s what makes the chapter more comfortable to read in; it didn\u2019t force the material on the reader but instead, it gives suggestions and real life examples about how being a teacher would look like. \u201cYou be the Judge\u201d is whole examples for a student to know how being a teacher could have a negative or positive impact on their lives, and it\u2019s a good way to them clarify their position whether to continue with being a teacher as a career meant to them or not convinced by. Also, there was a survey in the chapter that shows how many teachers get paid yearly in different states; it\u2019s a good side to the students to know that being a teacher could provide a decent life for them as a job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers need to have a bunch of specification in orders to be called a successor. Preparing a teacher to this career and guiding them to be effective to his class is an important step that could impact the whole future of both teachers and learner. That idea of preparation considers as an informative process and not implicit, and it\u2019s a good topic that's been clarified in that chapter. Moreover, another idea that been addressed at the end of the chapter is how the student could improve his skills and concepts of the learning process before graduation, and that been shown with listing several steps that the student should put into consideration in order to become successful and creative. It does not only help the learner himself in the long run but also give a chance to make his future classes more creative and cooperative at the time. For instance, some of the steps say that the teacher should study their courses that the handle carefully and planned for them ahead to make sure it\u2019s clear to him and would be to students at the time. Also, they should have a good impression during their learning process and to keep on building it on. That\u2019s how a student could have some ideas to consider and to begin with if they are struggling with what to start with or improve while they are still learning about their career.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students should figure out if the teaching career is the one that meant to them and they will enjoy practicing end for most of their life. That chapter did a good job in discussing some topic that will help the student take their decision regarding this career and if they willing to take that challenge and start filling and building their knowledge. It does not only help the student to become successful teachers but also prepare them to make a more bright future for the generation they will be willing to teach, and to be creative with their work and thoughts. So, after knowing and considering what a teacher need to handle and think of, the student will start to find their own way to teach and make their job process different from other teachers they encounter before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

Although it was a bit of a <em><strong>negative post</strong></em>, I received some <em><strong>positive feedback</strong></em>. I realised that I have been looking at Steemit from the wrong perspective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.org/m18fyrqb1/download_1.png\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\"/></p>\n<p>You see... <em><strong>I am a teacher</strong></em>, and to look at something from a teacher's perspective, is totally different than looking at something from a parent's point of view, or even a fellow steemit writer. &nbsp;I would like to thank @RHW for listening, and I am very glad to be part of this community. Many projects are being launched, &nbsp;and the whales are putting in a lot of effort to notice the new aspiring writers.</p>\n<p>I have changed my view on things now, &nbsp;I make a point to read as many posts as possible. I comment if needed, and I upvote a post if I find it interesting. We are not in a race here. We are after all in the business of finding new undiscovered talent and to be heard. Now, also said, that what interests me, <em><strong>might not be interesting to you at all.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p>What I have noticed is that there are quite a few nasty people on steemit. I am certainly not going to call them by their names, but I really feel sorry for these people, as they would not give someone the time of day.</p>\n<p><em>I felt very offended by some of the comments made about my post, but realised that negative feedback can be changed into a positive view.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><strong>I do not promote or upvote a post just for the sake of upvoting.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I &nbsp;do my fair share by reading as many posts as possible about my interests.&nbsp;</strong>Now, also said, that what interests me, <em><strong>might not be interesting to you at all.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>But people are just people.</strong></em>............people&nbsp;should try and upvote the good posts and promote these writers, so we can have new and exciting reading material here on Steemit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you do not succeed today, tomorrow is a new day. Try harder. Do not let negative comments make you lose your way. Don't give up. <em><strong>Stay positive.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Because if you are noticed by the right person, then your posts will mean something. Then you will have a voice.</strong></em></p>\n<p>I am totally up for a good debate and if you don't agree with me on posts, then&nbsp;feel free to contact me and we can discuss your opinion. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If you like my posts please follow me on<a href=\"https://steemit.com/@serioustruth\">@serioustruth</a><br>\nTogether we can change the world. Feel free to share or promote my posts. I want to make a difference to the way people think.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2764<strong>Keep on steeming!</strong></p>\n</html>",

Everyone was different, and that's what made each individual interesting. Nowadays, it seems most people just want to be like everyone else and fit in. Don't rock the boat, else you won't get your reward! It's like being in a Kindergarten class full of 20-30 somethings.\n\nThis younger generation seems to worry more about figuring out how to make themselves into a Gawd, while at the same time arguing over which psychopathic authoritarian they are going to vote for as their supreme leader. They do more thinking about who to vote for to control their lives than they do how they are going to survive on their own for the next 40 years or more.\n\nhttps://s16.postimg.org/dqbzdofj9/OK_dees_1_Copy.jpg \n\nWhich one of these \"leaders\" (and I must quote that) is going to do more for me, seems to be the biggest question of younger generations. While at the same time they hold onto the belief that everything was created just for them and everyone else is merely a part of them; their own personal sock puppets of pleasure who must reward them when they do something they consider to be worthwhile.\n<br>\n\nhttps://cdn.meme.am/instances/57755618.jpg\n\n# Vaporware Is Skeery\n\nOne of my biggest disappointments in this community came when @stellabelle, the person with the highest reputation on the site, made a post about an announced feature she liked in another decentralized blogging platform that doesn't even exist. \n\n### The horror! \n\nMany were quick to point out that the other platform was \"vaporware\", yet felt so threatened by her post about this \"vaporware\" that they created fictional stories to apparently discredit her. Others jumped on the bandwagon at every chance in the comments section. For what? For pointing out an announced feature in \"vaporware\"? Some even called this apparent \"vaporware\" a \"competitor\"!?\n\nhttps://s11.postimg.org/e5699gp5v/cover_ears.jpg\n\n# [Faith No More](https://youtu.be/3yVI3UgtvwU)\n\nThis says a lot about the faith these people actually have in Steemit. The fact that a piece of  \"vaporware\" can be considered a \"competitor\" to Steemit, along with the fact that these people feel threatened by this \"vaporware\" would make Leon Festinger roll over in his grave; **because he's dead ... just like this generations ability to debate on a topic without their favorite psychology book in front of them to fashion a response from someone else's thoughts.**\n\nWe even have one of the largest whales on Steemit flagging comments that dare mention a non-existent \"competitor\" or anyone saying anything that, in their mind, is considered \"divisive\" to the community. A flag from this person will all but hide a comment from anyone's view without seeking it out at the bottom of the page. \n\nhttps://s15.postimg.org/820q6kvkr/safe_space.jpg\n\n# [In Muh Safe Space](https://youtu.be/sXQkXXBqj_U)\n\n\nSo much for being a place to discuss anything openly. And yet, people here complain about Facebook and Reddit, yet I can mention Facebook all day on Reddit, and vice versa, and never have to worry that my comment will be hidden by a single individual. Even worse, Facebook and Reddit are some of the most censored platforms in existence.\n\n### Put that in your **[hash pipe](https://youtu.be/_9BGLtqqkVI)** and smoke it!\n\nSome here are taking it upon themselves to create a safe space for everyone else, because apparently the competition from these non-existent platforms is so strong we must hide their non-existent features very mention from the fragile masses. Back in my day, there was a saying ... \"competition is good\", but apparently that's no longer the case.\n\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/cal6wr4tt/manstuff.jpg\n\n# [Smells Like Teen Spirit](https://youtu.be/hTWKbfoikeg)\n\nHere on Steemit, it's hard to find anyone that appreciates sports, guns, hunting, cars or anything that my generation considers to be laced with testosterone. Sure I find computer/programming talk interesting, but it's rare these days to find people online that can talk the 4 basic man groups as well. I've found a few, but for the most part they are hiding within the Steemit caves of obscurity.\n\nSteemit advertises that \"original content\" is rewarded, yet anyone that can speak in great detail on any of those 4 basic man groups will rarely, if ever, be rewarded for doing so. There are a few of these well written articles on these topics here on Steemit, but you will be hard pressed to find one earning more than $5. Why Is that? \n\n### I'll tell you why ... because Steemit, for the most part, is lacking testosterone. \n# (\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b\n<br>\n\nhttps://s13.postimg.org/oou4yaqp3/Grinds_my_gears1.jpg\n\n# [What Grinds My Gears](https://youtu.be/Q685Ko2DHDs)\n\nYou know what really grinds my gears? Steemit. **Steemit really grinds my gears.** Why? Because I'm too old for this shit! And for that reason, **this will be my last post on Steemit**. I will be relinquishing my posting key access for this account and leave it to the younger generation of Tuck Fheman's, so they can post happy thoughts about all things Steemit and be rewarded untold fortunes for doing so. I am just holding them back.\n\nI did my best to be a part of this generations next big thing, but generation Steemit is just too namby-pamby for this old codger. \n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/9mkkeg19t/giphy.gif\n</div>\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/bcrfwvml9/mic_drop.gif\n</div>\n\n<br/>",

    "body": "Trading Steem is not hard. In that part steem(it) development team has done a great job. Compared to the establishment Steem is a huge step in the right direction of fairness and openness.\n# How the JS index works\nJS measures the net result of the buyers and sellers actions.\nEveryone buying Steem (or anything else) in any financial instruments market does it to profit. Interesting distinction is however if those buyers or seller do expect their profits short term or long term.\n\n## How short term Steem \u201cspeculators\u201d act?\nThey buy steem and expect return in a matter of days, weeks, months.\n## How long term Steem \u201cinvestors\u201d act?\nThey buy steem and expect return in a matter of years. They buy steem, and in this particular high devaluation environment that Steem is quickly power up .\n\nMeasuring the net result from the Steem \u201cspeculators\u201d and  Steem \u201cinvestors\u201d buying, compared to Steem owners selling can give us the ultimate tool to measure the future price movement of Steem (in  the short to medium term).\n\n# And it turns out to be incredible easy\nAll of the described above is nothing more than the \u2026 increase/decrease of the total Steem held by exchanges! (with a few caveats I will keep  proprietary for now)\n\n# How this matters\u2026 give me a practice example.\nOK here it is.\nSteem hit a local low of 0.001224 btc/steem on 08/29 4:30 UTC. Since then the price is generally higher. Should you buy (out of FOMO) or wait for the price to come down to even lower levels sometime in the near future.\nIf JS index has fallen down since  08/29 (as it has indeed) this means that all the buying (price increase) was by short time speculators. So, if no news justifie their buying exuberance, you can expect soon those speculative buyers to give up/cash out of their short term position and the price to continue following the long term trend of the JS index itself.\n\n# Initial JS index\nThe index is set at __1000.000__ as for 2016-07-26 12:56:12 UTC\n\n# Current  JS index\nAs of 2016-08-31 03:03 (UTC) the value is: __553.650__\n#\n[EDIT]\nBelow is a chart of JS Index and Steem price for July 27th to Aug 30th NB some days have more than one data point.\n#\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Ukazg7G.png)\n#\n#steemit #trading #finance #steem #money",

If you'd like to participate in the beta, simply send an email to steemapp@gmail.com and which device (iOS or Android) so we can send you a beta invite.  We're utilizing hockeyapp.net (microsoft) to manage the beta. \n\n### Some important things about the beta:\n- *Use at your own risk - **period**.*  \n- Don't login with an account that has your life savings in STEEM. Why? Because this is a beta product!\n- Don't login with your password if you don't feel comfortable - you can still use the app without logging in. Key import options will be available in a future version.\n- Images you upload from your mobile device are publicly available to the world. \n- Image hosting providers could change during the beta and your images could be wiped out permanently without notice\n- We receive crash reports, analytics and other useful debugging information from HockeyApp\n- Once signed up, you will receive notifications to download all future versions of the beta\n- Are there known issues? Yup! Expect frequent beta versions with no announcement.\n- Hockey provides features to send us feedback directly. There's a 100% chance we'll get your feedback if you submit through hockey app or email us steemapp@gmail.com.\n\n# How You Can Help\nWe are developing at a feverishly-fast pace...as fast as two guys can who have day jobs and families to support.  If we could, we'd say adios to the day job and focus 100% on Steemy (that's a dream I have weekly).   That being said, the reality is that we are building this with our own time, energy and spare funds.   That makes us no less passionate or driven, but imposes real-world constraints on development.\n\nYou can help us by:\n1) Participating in the beta\n2) Giving us constructive feedback on crashes, design, and other app-specifics\n3) Of course, financial - any funds we receive via upvoting go directly to supporting our monthly server costs, red bull addiction, etc...\n\n# How to sign up for the beta\n- Email us at steemapp@gmail.com and tell us which device (iOS or Android) you want an invite for\n- Or, if you don't care who sees your email address, post a comment below and specify iOS or Android (or both)\n\n# What is Steemy?\n\n[Learn more about Steemy Here](https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemapp/introducing-steemy-fully-native-ios-android-apps-for-steem)",

    "body": "![jumpingpeoplesteemitanarchyfaba6.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/jumpingpeoplesteemitanarchyfaba6.jpg)\n\nFor many of us, Steemit has already changed so much - the way we navigate the web, the way we think about money, and for a fortunate committed few, it's even changed their professions. However, the change that I expect from this model goes even deeper. It's possible that Steemit, and descendent technologies, may play a part in creating a voluntary world, a stateless world, in which everyone who takes money from someone, or puts someone in a cage without their consent, or orders such acts, will be seen and treated as a criminal. There are several ways in which Steemit can aid this cause. Let's start with the most important - the conversation.\n\n# It changes the way we talk\n![argument288ba5.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/argument288ba5.jpg)\n## The problem with voluntaryist argumentation\nMany of you might have noticed, and even been a party to, hard-line conversations about anarchy, in which the voluntaryist proceeds to take the words of the other party, and question them about some perceived inconsistency in their beliefs, attempting to lead them through a Socratic dialogue, in order to bring them to accept the truth - that the other party is wrong - very, very wrong. You also might have noticed (as I eventually noticed, after years of banging my head on walls) that this technique almost never works.\n\nOf course, the reason that it doesn't work, is because people have a need to feel that they're being understood, that their concerns are heard, that their thoughts are valid. In brief, they need to feel like people. If you don't treat someone like a person - unless you're talking to an exceptionally patient person - you're unlikely to receive a personable response.\n## An oasis\nThe comment section on YouTube is a running joke. Facebook discussions descend into dirtslinging, strawmen and threats. You may wade through many racist and sexist comments before you find something that is truly valuable information, and even then it may be tainted with aggression. In contrast, Steemit's comments sections seem like a desert oasis - all but filled with calm discussion, respect, insight, or at the very least, positivity. Surely, this is a place where one can have a constructive conversation about controversial topics.\n## The incentive to be good\nI have noticed over these few short months, the way that Steemit has changed the way that I interact with people, especially online - on Steemit and other social networks. I've found myself a few times, even as I'm about to make a statement which is mildly passive-aggressive, thinking \"Hold on - is this something I would write if my reputation were on the line? If not, maybe I shouldn't write it.\" Even when I'm going to give someone some piercing criticism, which, if presented in the wrong way, may seem a condemnation, I can find ways to demonstrate empathy, such as compliments or other niceties.\n\nIt may sound like an unfortunate description of humanity (or of myself) to say it, but when our bank balances and reputations are on the line in every moment, we can find ways to communicate more kindly, and therefore, more fluidly, with the people we interact with.\n## Commitment and consistency\nIn Cialdini's famous and excellent book, [Influence: The psychology of persuasion](http://amzn.to/2c5z38T) he describes how, when people make a commitment to something, they are more likely to see it as part of their identity, and strive to live up to that identity.\n\nWhen people are kind to each other, respectful, and even open-minded on Steemit, it's not just that they're pretending to be nice. By acting nicer, they become nicer. By acting more open-minded, they become more open-minded.\n## The quality of our ideas\nIf the ideas of voluntaryism are as good as we believe they are, then surely a place like Steemit, where people are strongly encouraged to be respectful, considerate, empathetic and even open-minded, would be an ideal place to discuss them. If it turns out that our ideas are not as good as we think they are, then it gives us the perfect medium to discover something even better. That is beautiful.\n# Tax-free and shameless\n![breakchains10ab9.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/breakchains10ab9.png)\nIn many developed countries, taxes are generally seen as legitimate and necessary, and people claim to be proud of paying their taxes - sometimes because they truly believe it, and sometimes because they don't want to face the fact that they have been forced into an elaborate con, from which they have no apparent escape.\u007f\n\nBut what if they did have an escape? What if, instead of being paid as an employee, having their income taxes automatically deducted from their pay, they were paid directly. What if thousands or millions of people were making income, or making a living, this way, and decided to openly flout the tax authority, publicly, knowing that it wouldn't have the resources to pursue any more than a small fraction of the cases?\n\nObviously, that would damage the appearance of legitimacy of the state, and also the perception of omniscience and omnipotence that its proponents tend to ascribe to it.\n# Development of cryptoanarchic solutions\n>\"Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word 'anarchy', in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It\u2019s a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.\"\n> - Wei Dai\n\nWe all know that Steemit/Steem is much more accessible than virtually any other cryptocurrency, being based around a style of platform which more than one billion people are already familiar with. That's pretty cool, and that means that more money will flow into cryptocurrency, meaning more attention, and thus even more development for similar technologies.\n\nMore development in cryptocurrency means more methods to control money, and other forms of information, publicly, privately, or anonymously, without governments being able to do anything about it.\n# Conclusion\nSteemit is an important step, a continuation of the snowball effect of cryptocurrency, leading us to a voluntary, cryptoanarchic future, full of wonders we have not yet imagined, and degrees of freedom as yet unforeseeable. Boldly we take our pens, pads, keyboards and wallets, building a highway to a world where concepts are our language and our tools, but never our weapons, where the purity of ideas is worth fighting for, but never worth fighting with.\n\n---\n\n# About me\n\n[![kurt robinson in the mountains of puebla](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/26/pictureofmecroppedbdb8d.md.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/gsqzK)\n\nMy name is Kurt Robinson.

Professional knowledge, in particular technical know-how, is a key asset for such organizations as their success depends to a large extent on their ability to create, manage and transfer knowledge efficiently. Let us call this process <strong>knowledge valorisation.</strong> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I review below some of the key enablers of knowledge valorisation&nbsp;by sketching a sort of road map.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Step 1</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;The first step shown below&nbsp;might look trivial, but I believe that most organizations (in particular those which are in the process of restructuring, M&amp;A, etc)&nbsp;might find it worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/ueoc9n77j/road.png\" width=\"959\" height=\"545\"/></p>\n<p>In other words,&nbsp;the first challenge is to make sure that knowledge is properly tracked and stored, especially if the organization is very large.&nbsp; If knowledge turns out to be mostly in <strong>implicit</strong> form, the organization runs a significant risk to lose knowledge and performance as a result of staff turnover, as when the key people leave or retire, nobody may be able to run some critical processes. In addition, as implicit knowledge is difficult to share, if explicit knowledge on key processes is not available, it is difficult for new recruits to become quickly operational. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>If a large body of documents spanning the organizational knowledge landscape is available in electronic format, it is appropriate to set up and use a formal knowledge classification scheme. The most powerful approach to knowledge classification, following the principles of semantics, is based on two components: &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Taxonomies</strong>, i.e. multi-level, tree-like classification frameworks. An example of a comprehensive, well-known taxonomy is Linnaeus\u2019 classification scheme for nature as divided into three kingdoms: mineral, vegetable and animal. Linnaeus used five levels: class, order, genus, species, and variety.&nbsp;Advanced knowledge management might call for the definition of multiple taxonomies, as shown in the example below. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Classification rules</strong>, i.e. a set of criteria to place each document in one (or more) positions in the taxonomy. Rules are typically based on specific properties of the document. Simple classification rules are based on keywords and other metadata, e.g. if a document has \u201cJava\u201d as a keyword, it is likely to be classified under a \u201ccomputer science\u201d branch of a technological taxonomy. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above elements, taken as a whole constitute an <strong>ontology</strong>, i.e. a detailed, potentially exhaustive description of a knowledge domain in terms of a collection of data records, together with their metadata/attributes, organized and classified in one or more taxonomy-based \u201ccatalogues\u201d. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/jbvf5lv93/semantics.png\" width=\"1006\" height=\"522\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The pictures above refer to&nbsp;an ontology which is relevant to a public research organization which regards technology transfer as part of its mission.&nbsp;Such organizations feel strong pressure by their funding bodies to demonstrate the positive socio-economic impact of public research on society through concrete examples. In order to meet such demands, they must define and implement a proactive and cost-effective Knowledge &amp; Technology Transfer (KTT) strategy. Then it is essential that all the knowledge assets in the organization are identified (technologies, general know-how, training capabilities) and as many KTT channels (licensing of intellectual property, joint R&amp;D with industry, training, people mobility \u2026) as possible are enabled. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>At this point, a classification engine is used:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/fk988pp6j/classify.png\" width=\"971\" height=\"558\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The ultimate deliverable is a context-sensitive, searchable knowledge catalogue&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/w8zb4dy35/catalogue.png\" width=\"1065\" height=\"616\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Informal Summary</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>All the tools described above aim at avoiding that in a large organization people reinvent the wheel all the time, just out of lack of knowledge of what their colleagues are working/have worked on. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, using the wheel analogy: if you are into technology transfer, such tools will help&nbsp;you show your \"wheel\" outside your organization and identify whoever could use it to make an innovative car!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note that some older comments to this post refer to (very different) content which has now been removed. Please disregard them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "Revamping Curation Is The Way To Increase Steem Power Demand\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been living under a rock, for the past month or so, it has been quite clear that the price of Steem has been rapidly falling. Although before the run up to $4 was most likely in a bubble and the system is in no danger of failing, as it has worked at this price before, I still believe there is a long term solution that needs to be found to fix this problem. Ned made a post yesterday talking about ideas he had, which mostly, in my opinion focused on lowering the supply entering the market, but this is only a symptom of the problem. My solution although a bit drastic addresses the problem which is a lack of incentive to purchase Steem and power up. \n\nhttp://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/sites/chicagoartistsresource.org/files/curator_1.jpg\n\nTo begin, what are the incentives now? Well the main incentive is having weight while voting, as well as getting a daily return on the Steem Power you have in the system. These might seem like adequate incentives in theory, but in practice I think we are seeing something very different. The problem right now is even with the daily interest we are getting on our Steem Power, we have still been losing money due to the price drops. The interest, which is supposed to act like inflation protection, is actually doing nothing because as long as the price is falling, people are not going to want to move their Steem dollars or Steem into Steem Power. We need to give a greater incentive to hold and purchase Steem Power that will benefit us as a community in the long run. Sure we can wait for the price to fall and have people cash out and make it cheaper to enter the system, but this still doesn\u2019t address the underlying problem.\n\nSo what is my solution? I strongly believe we need to move the payout split to 50:50 between authors and curators from the current 75:25 it is at. I know this will be controversial, especially because many authors today, INCLUDING MYSELF, are making essentially a living off the site, but ultimately it comes down to what is best for the community. We need to look at who is adding more value to the site, the authors or the curators. Depending on who you ask their answer might be different, but in my opinion both are equally as important. One cannot survive without the other and the payouts should reflect that.\n\nhttps://steemit.com/images/steemit-share.png\n\nCurating is supposed to be a heavy incentive for people to enter the system, but the earnings from it are subpar at best. For example, I have 20,000 Steem Power and my average earnings per day is around 6 Steem Power. That means my daily return on investment is .03% a day and only around 11% a year and that is with a pretty profitable curating strategy. Sure it will technically come out to a bit higher than 11% due to compounding but it still won\u2019t make that much of a difference. A huge selling point to me was that if you choose to curate rather than create content you will also be able to earn a sufficient amount, but no one is going to put 20,000 Steem into Steem Power that they would have to wait 2 years to pull out if the reward of waiting is not sufficient enough. Selling Steemit as a platform where the users who upvote the content are equally as valuable as the users who create the content makes users actually want to buy Steem and convert it into Steem Power. \n\nWe should not focus on slowing down the supply that enters the market, but rather retaining and creating new users that will become active daily. Once people have upvotes that actually mean something we will see people flock to the system. Rather than just browsing reddit and upvoting, with no return, they would have a much better experience here. The majority of the people on the site are not authors but lurkers or readers and we need to cater specifically to that crowd because they will end up as the masses, should more come. Authors deserve to be paid for their work but the percentage of money that goes to payouts is a lot. \n\n\nhttp://www.firebellymarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/building-community-Firebelly-570x467.jpg\n\nLike I stated before, I have been very successful and Steemit which is why I want to cut down my rewards, because if we continue in the direction we are currently going, it will become a race to the bottom , at which point everyone will leave. I strongly believe that splitting the curation rewards and author rewards equally can benefit the demand for Steem power in the long run and cause a higher amount of user retention within the system. \n\n-Calaber24p",

    "body": "<center>https://i.imgflip.com/p1ij6.jpg<br/>**CENSORSHIP**</center>\n\nLanguage is a very powerful tool because it shapes the way we think. The words we choose to use [impact how we think, feel, and reason about the world around us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity). Today I would like to address the word *censorship* because it is a very hot topic on steemit.\n\nThe first problem we always face is different and ambiguous definitions for censorship.  Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t always practical to *define* our terms in every debate and therefore drama queens toss the term \u201ccensorship\u201d around far too easily. I would go so far as to say that the censorship card is played about as often and illegitimately as the race card.  Often those who play the *race card* are more *racist and oppressive* than those they slander, the same principle applies to those who play the censorship card.\n\n## Censorship requires Aggression \n\nThe defining characteristic of a free society is the absence of initiation of violence. This includes the credible threat of violence, fraud, theft, etc.   Without the threat of aggression people can freely say whatever they want, whenever they want without fear that their person or property will be harmed. A critical distinction of a free society is that you cannot express yourself in ways that violate the property rights of others.\n\n## Graffiti is Aggression and violation of Property Rights\n \nGraffiti is defined as writing or drawings scribbled, scratched, or **sprayed illicitly on a wall or other surface in a public place**. In a free society the Graffiti artist would be tracked down and expected to pay restitution to the property owner.  No rational individual would argue that the artist has been censored by the property owner or that the property owner is the one initiating aggression against the artist.\n\n## Property Owner defines Art vs Graffiti \nThere are places where graffiti-style art is acceptable and is actually encouraged. In this case no aggression has occurred and therefore the action is legitimate. \n\n<center> https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7485/15754046208_7d666a75a9_o.jpg</center>\n\n## Spam, Porn, Harassment, and Fraudulent posts are Digital Graffiti  \n\nWhen it comes to websites like Facebook, YouTube, Google, Reddit, and Steemit we have digital property owned by individuals providing a free and voluntary service to society. It is not possible for these organizations to censor user content because they are not using violence, theft, etc. \n\nThe only true censorship is when government agents approach these companies and demand content be removed under threat of force or violence.  Provided these companies are not under any kind of threat, there can be no censorship.\n\nWhen someone [demands that YouTube share ad revenue](/steemit/@calaber24p/censorship-on-youtube-creates-an-unique-opportunity-for-decentralized-platforms-like-steemit-to-create-an-alternative-video) they are taking the role of the Graffiti artist that demands property owners not repaint over their artwork.\n\nSome people may consider the [Graffiti artwork worth thousands of dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy), but this doesn\u2019t change the moral character of the vandalism.  Likewise, some people may feel their humor, sarcasm, teasing, crude language, or vulgar posts to be artwork and demand that other users see it and/or up vote it for payment. \n\n## Graffiti Hurts Community Value \n\nWe all love the idea that Free Speech adds value to the speaker, but our selfish desires to be heard come at the expense of the listeners.  Few people desire to move into a neighborhood where there is unfettered graffiti and complete disrespect for property rights.  Likewise, few people want to join an online community where there are no standards of mutual respect.\n\n## A Perception Problem \n\nWe have a very real problem in society today.  The problem is that people feel *entitled* to things that are not theirs.  Whether it is health care, google ranking, reputation, or [right for gay couples to be served by particular vendors who oppose gay marriage](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jul/08/tony-perkins/wedding-vendors-have-been-forced-participate-same-/).  These entitlements can only be delivered by initiating force and violence against innocent people.\n\nIf a particular vendor (YouTube, Facebook, Google, or your Local Florist) will not serve you, then you must take your business elsewhere.  Vendors who lose a significant amount of business will voluntarily reconsider their policies.   \n\n## But they have a monopoly!  \n\nTo the extent that a business gains the vast majority of the market share without relying on government regulations to shield them from competition, the monopoly is deserved and was earned by providing a quality product that others were unable to compete with.\n\nThere are no laws forcing everyone to use Google, YouTube, Reddit, or Facebook. There are no regulations preventing competitors from starting up and competing.  Complaining about their unwillingness to serve you is like a local mall refusing to allow certain tenants.  It will certainly make business more challenging for those tenants, but the prospective tenants are not entitled to a prime high-traffic spot in the mall.\n\n## Flagging Posts based upon Differing Opinions \n\nSome people have been complaining about users who down-vote posts they disagree with. The basis of the idea is that all posts are *entitled to* funding from those who support the ideas.  This stance is in direct opposition to the vested interests of every stakeholder.  \n\n\n<center>http://godfatherpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/thomas-jefferson.png</center>  \n\nWhat should happen when one stakeholder wishes to fund a cause abhorrent to another stakeholder of equal size?  The two opinions are canceled out and the remaining stakeholders get to decide.\n\n## Incentive to be Tolerant and Inclusive \n\nAll users, particularly whales, have financial incentive to be tolerant and inclusive.  This grows the overall network effect and makes everyone the most money possible.  To the extent any community adopts a culture of intolerance that overly restricts the range of acceptable opinion it will push people away.  New communities will form to serve the needs of those who are rejected and the free market competition for mindshare will continue.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf Steem remains a libertarian / anarchist enclave then it will fail to attract a broader audience and that in turn will mean that ordinary people will not get involved with cryptocurrency.  Likewise, if Steemit fails to curtail abusive, threatening, and toxic individuals it will also drive away the broader audience leaving only those with skin thick enough to take the abuse of trolls.  \n\nI want Steem be a healthy, vibrant community with engaging discussions from people with all points of view. Unfortunately (and fortunately?), I am only one of many users who have a say in what kind of content gets voted on.  Each and every one of us contributes to the culture and we will all succeed or fail based upon how we act.\n\nLets stop throwing the term \u201ccensorship\u201d around here on Steemit unless it is explicitly referring to the threat of violence.  It is out of place and conjures up inappropriate negative reactions similar to playing the race card.  Instead, lets focus on the rights of all voters to express their opinion for or against any post.  If you disagree with how someone is voting, then focus your argument on how something adds or removes value to the community rather than whether someone is committing the \u201cvile\u201d sin of non-censorship by utilizing their legitimate voting rights.\n\nSteemit is a free and voluntary platform built on the basis of free association; censorship is impossible in such an environment even if the community or steemit.com chooses to minimize the visibility of some content or block it all together.  \n\nThe blockchain is open, your content is logged and recorded for all time.  Anyone who wants to see your content or offer a competing service to steemit.com is free to curate and display what they like.  \n\n## P.S. On Definitions \n\nWe live in a world where common words are generally used in ways that are in direct contradiction of their meaning.  The unfortunate reality dramatically lowers the quality of public discourse because it allows people to talk past each other.  Activists leverage the emotional response to the word censorship to provoke people into violating the property rights of others.  It may well be that censorship is taking on a broader meaning that would also encompass the no coerced behavior of Google, Facebook, etc.   The problem with the broader meaning is that the word censorship is no longer useful for accurately defining moral/immoral behavior.  Under the broader definition, accusing someone of censorship is as meaningless as accusing them of filtering spam emails.  How dare they censor spam artists!",

It\u2019s a fascinating thing really. This is one of the biggest mind-boggling mysteries that seem to defy even time itself, mysteries that are impossible to explain from a purely rational point of view.\n\nAsk any person in the world \u2013 scratch that \u2013 ask any person in the history of the world to describe politics in one word and you are guaranteed to hear some of the following words: Deceiving, dishonest, incompetent, cheating\u2026Etc. And probably, this is from the generous side.\n\nNow,  ask any of those people how come they trusted those individuals to manage their finances, and it would seem like you\u2019re speaking Chinese to them.\n\n## And that area right there is where the real game is being played.\n\nThat\u2019s the space where critical thinking dulls, where the emperor sells clothes, and no one\u2019s looking at Pinocchio\u2019s nose. How on earth would a known dishonest, power hungry person convince the others that he should be the one that makes the decisions on behalf of everybody?\n\nWorse than that, they give them all the power, no accountability and a virtual 100% probability to screw them , and everybody just keeps pretending to be surprised when these things happens.\n\n# Why Does This Keep Happening to Me?\n\nYou change the country, you change the century but the song remains the same, and the mystery survives. The only way to keep convincing people to accept a deal that acts against their own self-interest is to create a story that makes the exploitation of mankind look like the solution to their problem. \n\n![Alt text](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/lostpedia/images/b/b2/Lastsupper.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100117063640)\n\nYou look around, you find countries like Bolivia or Venezuela (just to give a few examples) that are extraordinarily blessed at the very same time with a rich abundance in natural resources  and a starving population despite the fact that these two things should be mutually exclusive by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nYou can\u2019t be that incompetent if you tried.\n\nBut then again, this isn\u2019t about incompetence. Their solutions were already predetermined in the narrative, and when it doesn't work and the tale falls on its own weight, they\u2019ll just repeat the same process again, because the narrative remains the same.\n\nThey keep seizing more lands, more factories and they keep \u201ccracking down\u201d on competition and seize everything in the name of \u2018the common good\u2019. Then they bankrupt them as well and they seize more and bankrupt those too. \n\n### If it wasn\u2019t so heartbreaking it would be hilarious.\n\nHere\u2019s the crazy part of all this is that  this wide spread phenomenon is completely irrelevant to the economic system, the economic policy, or to the continent, and it's happening across the board. \n\n![Alt Text](http://redlikeme.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bank-robbery-digital-art-hd-wallpaper-1920x1080-2127.jpg)\n\nFind me a person in southern Europe that has good things to say about politicians in the ECB.\n\nAll the solutions they present are hell bent on screwing the little guy, whether it\u2019s draconian austerity measures, raising the retirement age, bank bail outs\u2026Etc\n\nI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s due to incompetence, dishonesty, or both. I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s irrelevant, because the solution is already pre-set beforehand to achieve one purpose, and one purpose only, that power keeps consolidating itself. \n\nThat might explain why we always keep hearing sentences like this one: *\u201cThe game is rigged\u201d*, which happens to be one of the most popular expressions of our generation.\n\nLet me give you another example.\n\nWhen you turn on the radio and there are some finance experts on, how many times we hear the following words: \n\n*They\u2019re making things worse; They\u2019re repeating the same mistakes again;  Things are actually getting worse and not better; The solutions are creating more problems than solving; How come the recovery is worse than the recession?*\n\nYou see where this is going? \n\nAnd this is not exclusive to our generation, in fact this story form is a very common archetypal myth that exists across every society and period of human history.  With the very same the result, that whatever action that will be taken it will only serve to reinforce the dominant narrative.\n\n# Once Upon a Time\n\nIt is believed that the cavemen were the first storytellers, and whoever controlled the dominant story had a strong pull on the rest of society.\n\n![Alt Text](http://www.kino.de/wp-content/gallery/homo-erectus-2007/homo-erectus-einfach-pr-hysterisch-11-rcm0x1920u.jpg)\n\nThe  human story is at the heart of everything, it\u2019s the prima material of how most people perceive reality, the moment you question someone else\u2019s dominant narrative, the debate is over before it\u2019s even started. For many people, they much rather fall for the same thing again and again and until the end of times, rather than to dare questioning the story they grew up around.\n\n> ### *\u201cIt\u2019s easier to fool people, than show them that they have been fooled\u201d.*\u2014 Mark Twain\n\nThe crazy part however, is that the even if those individuals were to fully realized how they've been fooled, they would probably still willingly walk towards the fire nonetheless. Metaphorically speaking.\n\n### Unless of course, there is a new story that replaces the old story.\n\nI remember reading one of James Altucher\u2019s amazing posts and had a wake up call. I hope I\u2019m not butchering the story, but it basically it goes like this: A friend of James asked him to go with her to the bank to help her decide the best option for her to put her money. Since he has some solid expertise in the finance world, it seemed like a wise decision for her part.\n\nDuring that meeting in the bank, James just sat down, said nothing and only listened, when they finally left the bank he started explaining to her all the ways that they were trying to take advantage of her and rip her off.\n\n*\u201cHow can they do that to me?\u201d*\n\nThe next day, she went to the bank and did everything they asked her nonetheless.\n\n![Alt text](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/maggiemcgrath/files/2015/06/0211_hipster-piggy-bank-401k_1024x576.jpg)\n\n# This is How the Story Goes\n\nCommon folklore has it that there are those people among us that regular people  that look just like me and you, but when they get a magical paper that says that they work for the status quo, then an invisible laser descends from the sky and grants them all sorts supernatural abilities and financial savoir-faire.\n\nWell, sort of... Everything they touch still goes to crap, but that doesn\u2019t matter anymore and their never-ceasing incompetence doesn\u2019t seem to bother anyone either. Because now, they're part of the narrative.\n\n### And apparently, narrative trumps logic. \n\nA successful investor once told me: *Never listen to government economists, if they knew how to manage money, they would\u2019ve made money themselves instead of telling people what to do.*\n\n![Alt Text](https://ascendingstarseed.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/cc12b-preppers2b-2bdoomsday.jpg)\n\nAs the Altucher story goes, along with countless others, whenever there is a threat to the narrative, the debate is over before it has even started. For many people in the world, defying authority is just about the last thing they would do, and that includes killing themselves and their own children.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to the subject of the day. We tell ourselves a story that defies every single law of the universe, that the idea of good business is spending trillions of Dollars bombing millions of people and generating the biggest debtor nation the world has ever seen.\n\nIf that is not telling you anything then honestly, I don\u2019t know what does.\n\nWe tell ourselves even crazier stories, that if we just grabbed enough productive citizens and stacked them into jail cells for victim-less crimes, or for carrying bits of vegetation in their pockets, then we're going to revitalize the economy, and that oh! We will rehabilitate those poor souls through brutality and sexual violence.\n\n### Again, narrative trumps logic in ways logic can't even perceive.\n\nSome people choose to deny their programming, and that seems as the right choice because sooner or later those stories could start acting as their very own gatekeepers. I\u2019m not talking about inner resistance, I\u2019m saying that maybe we need a new story that replaces the old story.\n\n![Alt Text](http://i0.wp.com/dailyzen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/How-to-Make-Good-choices-and-make-the-most-of-them.jpg)\n\nThere has never been a better time for financial independence than the times we live in, there has never been so many options available for someone to start their own company, find jobs, or make their own movies even\u2026 All of that without dealing with a large number of resistant gate-keepers who may or may not have been programmed to serve a certain narrative.\n\nI don't know about you but personally, if I had to follow a narrative, I much rather have one that I designed for myself rather than one that I was born into.\n\n# Closing thoughts\n\nThey say that when there is a paradigm shift, there is usually a new story that renders the other story irrelevant, but until then and even though the tools are already available to the public, people will not make the final move until they start seeing a certain degree of mass-adoption around them.\n\nIt is that mass adoption aspect that would make it acceptable for their psyche to separate from that old, probably coercive narrative that has been attached to them.\n\n![Alt Text](http://www.elfm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/storytelling-night.jpg)\n\nA few minutes ago, I was just going to end this piece with a question: \u201cDoes the Blockchain need a story?\u201d\n\nBut then I realized that steemit has both the crypto-currency and the story aspect. So I\u2019m swapping that question for a few modest words:\n\nCan we just work together to build something beautiful? Do you guys see what we have here? Why don\u2019t we just focus on what we have and how we can improve it. After all, it\u2019s much harder to create something really great when you\u2019re being held back by unnecessary drama. Wouldn't you agree?\n\n And not to forget:\n\n### Your dream needs you full steem.\n \nSources: [1](http://www.geliosoft.com/100-happy-dollars-3d/) - [2](http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lost_Supper) - [3](http://redlikeme.ca/tpp-is-all-about-banking-powers-which-will-remain-secret-for-5-years-after-signing/) - [4](http://www.kino.de/film/homo-erectus-2007/) - [5](http://money.cnn.com/pf/millennials-and-their-money/) - [6](https://ascendingstarseed.wordpress.com/category/economy-and-global-collapse/) - [7](http://dailyzen.co.uk/2015/03/19/how-to-make-good-choices-and-make-the-most-of-them/) - [8](https://storify.com/ProfKarim/the-power-of-storytelling)\n\n## [*Follow the Alien*](https://steemit.com/@the-alien)",

    "body": "<center>https://stakepool.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/photo3.jpg</center>\n\nSo, I was sitting in my $5000 massage chair smoking a cuban cigar when all of a sudden all kinds of bells started ringing. So I had to stop what I was doing and walk all the way over to my enormous trading-desk on the opposite side of my man-cave to see what was going on, and of course - there it was... A new post from my ex-boyfriend who cannot believe I dumped him for a better looking guy, and I knew he was out for blood so I started reading:\n\n<h3>A littlebit of history first</h3>\n\nWhen I wrote against @stellabelle and her article about synero-amp vs steemit, @tuck-fheman started spamming my comment section with all kinds of accusations, and lately he has started what he calls a \"comic-strip\" about me where he is doing his very best to harass the hell out of me.\n\n<h5>I still stand by what I wrote in my article against @stellabelle - it was a very dumb move on her behalf and I have people on record who confess to buying synereo-amp and losing money because of her article. The point of calling her out was to let her know that she has a loud voice in this community, and that she therefore must be careful advising people about investments and projects in a market she has no real clue about, because she is new.</h5>\n\nThen, when I apologized in public to @heiditravels for using explicit words when I was mad at her for not showing up to a Public Relation Interview when she came to Per\u00fa, an Interview that would have gone out on Television to 10 million Peruvians in prime-time and maybe secure 200,000 new signups for Steemit, he went on another rampage and started posting screenshots of the conversation and tried to get people to flag my post, which did not work because people are not stupid around here - they see what is going on.\n\n<h1>I still think what @heiditravels did was selfish, but I am over it - It is history @tuck-fheman - she wanted the @dollarvigilante more then me, and I have come to accept that he is much better looking then me, no homo :) (Just kidding)</h1>\n\nToday @tuck-fheman posted another harassment-cartoon, and even went to the #steemitabuse chat and bragged about it, told people that I was a sociopath that needed to be stopped, a woman-abuser and many other things that was just degrading and sad to read from him.\n\n<h2>Tuck & Stella = Early adopters who made a lot of steem posting pure shit</h2>\n\nSo what do I do? He is one with the most reputation on Steemit because he was very early into steemit and was in the original \"circle-jerk\"-club as they called it. Apparently back in those days you could post a picture of your garbage-can and make thousands of steem and now a days you have to actually make real content with real value.\n\nThen we have @stellabelle - I have nothing against her, never tried to attack her in any way - just had to speak up when she decided to embrace synereo-amp in a way that felt like... she was pooping where she was eating and I have honestly not read a single article she has published since. Instead I have found new aspiring artists like @poeticsnake who make amazing drawings and really put in a lot of real work in her art.\n\n@stellabelle also is from the very early adopters of steemit who made a lot of steem by writing articles about how she ripped of her friends when she was a car-salesman, or how she used to shoplift in stores when she was rich. Something to be proud of? Would those articles be worth anything if she wrote them today?\n\n<h1>In case you don\u00b4t know what I do on Steemit, I make comedy, entertainment, cartoons Here are a few examples for earlier:</h1>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojNbGf5oIhM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh-TKt_GSCc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijVJNn0qgxg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHzdXtFKwYA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SMMo7aQnPY\n\n\n---\n<h1>I also do Technical Analysis of Forex, Stocks and Crypto-Currency in posts like this:</h1>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyXt_kJhomU\n\n---\n\n<h1>And I also make funny songs about steemit and crypto like this:</h1>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P2FB9Mg_YI\n\nand like this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gfntBEI3Aw\n\n---\n<center>So please - Tuck-Fheman, Stellabelle - Leave me alone if you are going to act like bullies and collude and harass me - there is no point to that! <b>Start doing something positive for Steemit instead of all this negativity! </b>And to all the rest of you - I hope you see it that I loud and clear do not want to have anything to do with these two people. </center>\n---\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JhD2D0s.png\"></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DLFAEdd.png\"></center>\n\nBreaking up is never easy, I know - but you have to let me go :)",

Many people don\u2019t like competition, some people fear it, some people get motivated by it, and some people see it as an opportunity that helps them step up to the next level.\n\nPersonally, I get the same emotional reflex from new competition than I get from any change of weather, it doesn\u2019t really faze me that much.  Long time ago I\u2019ve learned to open a new folder in my brain containing all the elements that I can\u2019t control, and the emergence of new competition certainly qualifies for that folder.\n\nAnd the reason I do that is because I think that the worst thing you possibly can do is to let your fear-based reactions make your decisions for you.\n\nAlthough to be totally honest with you, I\u2019d be an idiot if I told you to completely ignore competition and act as if doesn\u2019t don\u2019t exist. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s well worth your attention because it may show you something you\u2019ve missed, it may remind of why you do what you do in the first place, and depending on the competition, it can even help you improve and advance. \n\n![Alt Text](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jCsWg5lEM9w/To2MZ4wwQMI/AAAAAAAAI8Q/VNo2kdw4ot8/s640/Matrix_067Pyxurz.jpg)\n\nA few months ago a new disruptive technology came to the world. It allowed all sorts content creators to make some income doing what they love, all while bypassing the restrictive censorship of armies of gate keepers around the world. And since you\u2019re reading this, then you\u2019re probably using it too.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, when what you do is truly amazing, you can\u2019t really expect that no one else is going to try to replicate it. In fact, the strange thing would be that if no one was ever going to attempt to create \u201cthe new steemit\u201d.\n\nAfter all, competition is a part of life, and it\u2019s almost here so maybe it\u2019s time we talked about it.\n\n# Dancing with Mr. Ying and Miss Yang\n\nOn the positive side, competition can make us stronger and more connected. All those small debates and unnecessary dramas would suddenly take a back seat to more important matters. \n\nIt can motivate us to up our game and take it to the next level. It can encourage us to keep improving so we don\u2019t get too comfortable. It can help us realize what we have, and not take it for granted. \n\n![Alt Text](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TVDMaHEL61w/U1_ZuVFcttI/AAAAAAAAMvg/dt0wlqDLFWI/s1600/living+in+the+matrix.jpg)\n\nBut there's another way  to approach competition, the Yang way, where you can go to that room where you archive all those things that you can\u2019t control, head towards the door and kick it wide open. Just sit there and let fear invade you.\n\nI know this sounds crazy, but believe it or not, the second most common thing people do in face of competition is to fear it and let them rush into making unnecessary decisions. Now, I don\u2019t know about you but to me panic doesn\u2019t precisely strike me as a solid strategy.\n\nHowever, I do understand why some people might experience some concerns. *\"Look, there\u2019s a new competition, they have a brand new website, their logo looks so professionally made, their name is so catchy. Hell, they even have shiny shoes\u2026\"* \n\nFrom that point on, it will be just a matter of time until this question starts circling around: *What if people start pouring there?*\n\nI hate to break it to you, but these things can and will probably happen.\n\nA few steemians will move there and that\u2019s ok. In fact, that\u2019s very understandable, they will have their reasons. Maybe they go on their own, or maybe they will have an offer to join. \n\nSo when that happens, there are two things that you can do:\n\nYou can worry that people are migrating elsewhere, or you can remember the \u201csecret\u201d: That they will never stop making people. \n\nPlus, if that if the goal is expansion, then it\u2019s a comfort knowing that the journey hasn\u2019t changed and that we\u2019re still on the same course.\n\n# Destination Moon\n\nThat  are enough potential users in the planet for everyone, they will never stop making people, remember? \n\nPlus, if the dream was grow and reach hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people, then nothing has really changed in the grand scheme of things. right?\n\nMaybe a few will leave and it\u2019s ok, maybe they\u2019ll come back quickly afterwards, maybe they won\u2019t or maybe this is a good opportunity to remember:\n\n## That moon we all talked about, our moon, is still the goal.\n\n![Alt Text](https://s9.postimg.io/ptqv6s6of/Untitled_design.png)\n\n*Picture dedicated to @smooth.  Thank you for the logo advice!*\n\n# A View from the Future\n\nSo in the future if you read some open letters from some prominent writers explaining why they moved away to the competition, so maybe we don't need to give these things more importance than they deserve.\n\nSometimes diversification is a smart move, sometimes people need to look for what\u2019s best for them, and sometimes they look for whatever they perceive as such. Whatever the case may be, it\u2019s still their choice and they are free to change their minds.\n\nAnd yes, we will probably read a few editorial posts about *\u201cWhy I left steemit for X\u201d* and maybe a little worry might circle your train of thought. \n\nMaybe their reasons are totally valid, or maybe they\u2019re unconsciously making up a story with which they can justify it to themselves. So all of the sudden every small problem is magnified and the grass on the other side looks greener. It happens.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s not our place to judge them.\n\nAnd yes, the preachers of doom will jump at the opportunity to parade their psychic abilities, *See? People are leaving steemit already. I told you!*, but when that happens please remember that we\u2019re talking about people who never let a good crisis go to waste. So whatever they say should probably be taken with a fine pure grain of Himalayan salt.\n\nThese are things that we can\u2019t control, here\u2019s what we can do.\n\nWe can step up, we can up our game, we can show them what this platform has already proved, we can remember why we joined and that maybe, just maybe show them that we are still fighting for that fucking moon.\n\nBecause let\u2019s not forget, steem is third behind Bitcoin and Ether.\n\n### And just as Bitcoin had so many new competing coins that were going to completely erase it from the map, we\u2019ll probably hear the same song again.\n\n![Alt Text](http://tr1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2014/11/04/27691a45-1606-4647-9093-637886cc89be/forecast-crystal-ball-prediction.jpg)\n\nThere will be many death predictions too. Bitcoin had about a hundred of them, so don't be surprised when that happens.\n\nBut what if I\u2019m wrong and the competition is very strong?\n\nWell then we learn to compete better. Competition is a part of life, and it can make you better if you know how to approach it. In fact, [I wrote about the subject in the past](https://steemit.com/life/@the-alien/blasts-from-the-past-lessons-from-running-a-bar-at-a-young-age).\n\nSo this goes for those of us who experienced the life changing abilities of this platform, and especially for those who are crazy enough to still believe in the same dream that we are at the beginning  stages of a beautiful game changer. For those who still have the same passion about disruptiveness as in the first day, here\u2019s something that we can do:\n\n# We Can Bet on Our Strengths\n\n![Alt Text](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cm8iJ91XEAIVokI.jpg)\n\nWe can focus on what steemit has achieved already and introduce it to the world. How many people have made some good income already? How many projects has steemit helped? How many it has brought in to life? How many relationships have been forged?\n\nSo maybe you\u2019re a filmmaker looking for a good story, maybe you can make a documentary about the lives that steemit has changed and its future effects on society, maybe the rest of us can help you.\n\nMaybe I should listen to my own words and lead by example. Maybe I should carve out some time and finally launch my very own book that was born out of pure steem.\n\nOr maybe we shouldn\u2019t have to do anything at all. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t have to step up our game just yet, and ignore any competition.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure.\n\nWhatever the case may be, I just want you to know that if you\u2019re here for the long run, than you should know that more competition will come, and when that happens don\u2019t listen to the alarming voices and trust your own judgement.\n\nI want you to know that it\u2019s not the end, that this is the beginning and that I hope that you\u2019re still enjoying this beautifully game changing ride and not planning to give up your seat just yet.\n\n#### Image Sources: [1](http://dailyseoblog.com/how-to-discover-your-competitions-seo-strategies/) - [2](http://pyxurz.blogspot.com.br/2011/10/matrix-page-2-of-7.html) - [3](http://humansarefree.com/2014/04/16-signs-that-you-are-slave-living-in.html)- [4](http://wallpaper.zone/carlsberg-wallpaper) - [5](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/peering-into-the-crystal-ball-it-leader-predict-major-tech-trends/) - [6](https://twitter.com/riaali4)",

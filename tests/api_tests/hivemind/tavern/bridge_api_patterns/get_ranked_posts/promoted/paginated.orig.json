    "body": "Luke, the man with the numbers :) I love the idea. Interesting stats to look at:\n* Highest promoted amount per post\n* Highest number of promoters per post\n* Highest non-author promoted amount\n\nThere may be others who have already though to do 15.001. I too started with 10.001 in mind and got to 13.63 to have a good front-ish seat :) but I think amounts will start being higher and higher as pressure builds to be on the *first page*.\n\n@berniesanders is the real MVP, have said it before and it's still valid. Nice ROI on your post! Classic bump and reward case. Exactly what Post Promotion has been built for.\nI'm more testing the thing now but thank you for the feedback! It's good to see that my *marketing* campaign is showing results!\n\nYeah, up one for @smooth and @jesta! #classy",

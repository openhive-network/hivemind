They're not fully mature and could use a good rinsing by the community.\n\n## Allow Steem holders to delegate their Steem Power voting rights to a **voting pool**\n\nA delegated voting pool could socialize voting power and individualize rewards.  One prime use for this could be the @steemit account.  @steemit could create a voting pool and invite anyone with a verified identity and good reputation to join the pool as a curator.  This could increase the number of unique curators, help bootstrap Steem as an identity database and give people even more incentives to sign up.\n\nTo show the numbers, an example would be Alice Bob and Charley each delegate their SP of 2, 3, and 7 to one voting pool.  Now they each have 4, 4, and 4 SP to be used to curate.  Better curation would earn them more curation rewards.  \n\nA side effect of delegated voting pools could be voting markets.  Any user would have the power to create a voting pool and these users could charge curators for participation. Some of the platform's whales could be interested in offering subscription models to minnows as a way to get more voting influence.\n\n## If powering down stake loses voting influence\n\nImagine that any stake being powered down would lose its rights to use voting influence.  This could make the system very clear in the regard that stake is either in or it is out.  Users could be able to choose any % of their stake to power down regardless of how many accounts they have and only the % stake that is powering down would lose voting influence.  Stopping a power down could return all voting rights.\n\nPerhaps the effect of this could be 1/ more interest to stay in the platform and 2/ more fluidity in the witness queue 3/ more fairness regarding the PoS nature of Steem 4/ more clarity from participants looking to exit the system\n\n## Combined effect?\nPerhaps these proposals could have a combined effect that increases the demand and fluidity of Steem Power while improving the curated experience for people visiting Steem based websites.\n\n#### What are your thoughts and questions?",

Right now, if you are not upvoted by a \"whale\" account, it is very difficult to get exposure and any substantial rewards, which leads to many great authors leaving Steemit. Robin Hood wants to be the \"whale\" that finds and helps a diverse set of talented, yet unrecognized authors. \r\nMore Info Here -> <a href=https://steemit.com/steem/@repholder/the-robinhood-whale-initiave-community-feedback-needed>The RobinHood Whale Initiave</a>   |  [Announcing RobinHoodWhale](https://steemit.com/robinhoodwhale/@robinhoodwhale/announcing-robinhoodwhale-the-steemit-deep-sea-savior)\n<h3> Voting History (Real-Time Update) </h3> \n<li>01-09 <a href=https://steemit.com/introduction/@leahlindeman/what-do-we-do-when-life-gets-in-the-way-of-our-dreams>What Do We Do When Life Gets in the Way of Our Dreams?</a> by @leahlindeman in <a href=https://steemit.com/trending/introduction>introduction</a></li>\n<li>01-09 <a href=https://steemit.com/savings/@sgnsteems/a-tale-of-a-couponer-the-beginning>A Tale of a Couponer- The Beginning</a> by @sgnsteems in <a href=https://steemit.com/trending/savings>savings</a></li>\n<li>01-09 <a href=https://steemit.com/politics/@heretickitten/abortion-your-body-your-choice-or-is-it-the-child-s-body-that-you-are-choosing-for>Abortion: Your body, your choice?

    "body": "# Happy September. #\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/3wokqy0mf/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s15.postimg.org/3jx6kricr/image.jpg' border='0' alt='image'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/'>\n\n**I know others on this website have said this, so I'm not the first, but yeah, I quit my job to write for Steemit.** \n\nActually, though, that's not entirely true. It's kind of true. I quit my job because something shifted inside of me. When the job was gone, Steemit, on the selfsame day, rose up into my focus immediately to fill the void like it was just waiting for me to finally get real. To do this stuff I've always been wanting to do. And always *have been doing* at the expense of sleep, money, time, etc. I was now beginning to get *paid for it.* What the!?!\n\n**The first half of August was bliss.** After some initial discouragement, I found some good verbs in the mouth of one Sterlin Luxan, and was inspired to actually dig down inside of myself and make a more [honest post.](https://steemit.com/steemit/@kafkanarchy84/why-i-have-quit-five-jobs-in-the-past-six-years-a-steemit-confessional) I finally made twenty bucks on the site. From there I thought, hell, I'll just do this full time. I began to make significant sums of cash for an honest day's worth of work writing, and felt that with my side job,  as long as I hammered down, I would be able to cover my family's usual expenses by the time September rolled around.\n\n\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/wk9d1kjsx/image.jpg\n*Spending time with my son has been one of the biggest bonuses of leaving my 9-5.*\n# **Well. August 31st. Paying all my bills with SBDs? No such luck, my friend.** # \n\nBut I will tell you one thing. I never dreamed I could pull down 2Gs cold, hard cash through writing in less than a month, even if one half of it is still vested in Steem Power (I am happy about this). I was sick to my stomach, though. I have a wife and a child. Playing games at this point was not an option. Still....I had heard something that was very lovely and very clear.\n\nIt was a kind of feeling I have never had before, but which was also at once very perfectly familiar. As my kid is playing on the Octopus slide behind me, and I am staring out at the sea, it hits me:  ***It's over. You will never teach kids again.***\n\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/4xqdopsip/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s16.postimg.org/dfztt1z1h/image.jpg' border='0' alt='image'/><br />\n\n**Weird. It's like my wish, but this time I am not even wishing for it. It comes to me. I just know that that chapter of my life is completed. That was the day after I quit my job.**\n\n**Fast forward to the end of the month.** I haven't made enough money like I had hoped....I pray to someone or something over my Matsuya beef bowl in the sketchy back alley district of the burlesque dancers: *what should I do?* I was really, really feeling low and full of doubts and self-accusations.\n\nImmediately that silly voice came back again: \n # *(Keep doing what you're doing)* #\n\nI haven't been eating this month. Haven't been sleeping. Have had headaches. Upset stomach. Welcome to fear. Welcome to the real shit. You were so cocky! Are you lazy!? You didn't like your job but so what!? You've got a family!!! Son comes home from daycare. *DAAAAADDDYYYYYY!!!!!!! Let's play!!!!!*\n\nPull yourself together.\nDon't show your frayed nerves.\n\n**My wife is equally worried.**\nShe needs security. She wants to get into massage. Vocal training school. So many dreams. Here I am sitting around the house in my underwear when all I really want to do is hand her a big fat envelope full of money.\n\nhttps://s17.postimg.org/56h7g4qxb/image.jpg\n\n**I've never been lazy. I will work my ass off when I care, and when I need to.** Fuck sleep. Fuck food. Fuck everything but the goal. \n\n# I just can't seem to give a damn about most shit that everybody else says is important. #\nWell, a lot of shit, at least. Still. Mouths to feed, my friend. But that \"voice,\" didn't it mean something? And despite the nerves, hasn't this been one of the happiest, most productive months of my life? Yes. Yes, and yes. Besides, the other job was no good. Bad, unsustainable situation. You know that, Graham.\n\nhttps://s15.postimg.org/i7lfk6hzv/image.jpg\n*My buddy Kevin shows up to the Local.*\n\n**Back to now, August, 31st, 2016. Evening. I went to my friend Craig's bar tonight.** At the depth of my despair, on the bus ride over, I received a mail from my other friend, Aidan. There might be some part time work at his school. Mail sounds promising. \n\nAfter a couple beers at Craig's place it is settled I will work Saturdays mixing booze and playing guitar. I am starting to feel good again. It is starting to seem possible that I can build my own, full-time, part-time \"Steem-lance\" schedule. [Fake priest weddings](https://steemit.com/religion/@kafkanarchy84/my-life-as-a-fake-priest-true-believer), English classes, serving beer and singing....and....\n\n# STEEEEEEEEEEEEMMMMMM!!!!!!! #\n\nAnd you know what? \n\nI am going to document it every step of the way. This is the first episode. Hope to see you next time, from my first day on the job as a bartender. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/jasziAzaiZ4\n\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/rjlhw49rp/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s18.postimg.org/aj2lnfwqh/image.jpg' border='0' alt='image'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/'>\n\nhttps://s17.postimg.org/yb9pkx39b/image.jpg\n*Basically how I feel now that I have discovered Steemit.com*\n\nPeace, Love, and Anarchy,\n\n~KafkA\n\nP.S. Another thing I have never been good at is keeping a consistent diary. I'm too private, and can't be bothered, even for myself. Should \"My Steemit Life\" transform into an existentialist thought stream ramble resembling a blog-turned-extended-acid trip, please forgive me. Maybe I will commit to  5 episodes. That sounds like a good number to me. Deal?\n\n***\n*Graham Smith is a Voluntaryist activist residing in Niigata, Japan.*",

We see, feel, taste, hear and smell unknowingly how it works. As we were children we called anything into question and now accept reality as it is. We lost the magic in all these wonderful things. This series addresses the wonder of natures and will bring its magic back to light. The first part of the <strong>Life Explorers - The Human Senses </strong>starts with the sense of sight. We see forms and colors, see bright and dark. But why?<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To be able to answer this question we first need to have look at the nature off light. Light is a form of electromagnetic (EM) radiation, to be accurate we need to speak of visible light because only a small portion of the actual EM spectrum is visible to the human eye. The following illustration shows the EM spectrum. Frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional, the shorter the wavelength the higher the frequency. With higher frequencies the amount of energy is rising, this is for instance the reason why Gamma Rays are deadly. The high energy of the gamma rays are devastating for biological cells as they are ionizing and cause secondary radiation like X-Rays or electron diffraction. E= h \u2022 f is formula which depicts the proportionality of <strong>E</strong> energy and <strong>f</strong> frequency (<strong>h</strong> stands for the Planck constant). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here a little example for the energy of a short and a long wavelength.&nbsp;</p>\n <table>\n      <tr>\n        <td>red</td>\n        <td>E=h \u2022 f = 6,626 070 040 \u00b7 10\u221234 J*s * 384 THz</td>\n        <td>1,59 eV</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>violet</td>\n        <td>E=h \u2022 f = 6,626 070 040 \u00b7 10\u221234 J*s * 789 THz</td>\n        <td>3,26 eV</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n<center><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/uajq64zo1/emspectrumvis.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"766\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig. 1. The electromagnetic spectrum. Source: </em><a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/32344-what-are-x-rays.html\"><em>Livescience</em></a></center>\n<p>As shown above the visible light is only a tiny portion of the EM spectrum. The human eye is able to see colors from red to violet, which is equivalent to wavelengths from 780nm to 380nm (nm = nanometer).</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>Why do is the Steemit logo blue and not red?</strong></h3>\n<center><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/isgrqldc9/steemitlogo.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\"/></center>\n<p>Sure because @dantheman and @ned decided so :) But on a scientific base, how come we see blue and not another color?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now that we know what visible light is let\u2019s have a look at the interaction of EM radiation and the objects we see. The actual color we perceive depends on the physical principle of reflection and adsorption. &nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nMost objects reflect light but before that happens they adsorb part of the light they receive. The wavelength they adsorb determines what your eye will process later. For instance when all wavelengths expect red (780nm) are adsorbed the object will reflect red. Same goes for a blue steemit logo for instance. The logo absorbs all wavelengths expect the blue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More than one wavelength can be reflected the same time, this therefore is why we see shades of the same color. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/eajm6sv8r/prismandrgb.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"337\"/></center>\n<p>We can see purple color when blue and red are reflected wavelengths. We see white when an object absorbs no light. &nbsp;<br>\nIsaac Newton showed that white light contains all colors. He used a prism to separate the colors of spectrum of visible light. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>How does reflection and adsorption work? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>To understand how adsorption works we need to have a closer look into the chemistry of molecules. As described light hitting an object, here molecule, is adsorbed and we see the complementary color as a result. The following abbreviations will be used: HOMO = Highest occupied molecule orbital and LUMO = Lowest unoccupied molecule orbital. Carrots are orange, but why? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/5q33u4jup/steemcarrot.jpg\" width=\"634\" height=\"800\"/></center>\n<p>Electrons are moving in a certain space around the nucleus, called orbitals. The energy of light promotes an electron from a bonding or non-bonding orbital into an empty anti-bonding orbital, from HOMO to LUMO. The gap between these two orbitals is equivalent to the amount of energy that is needed to promote the electrons. A larger gap therefore requires light with more energy, for instance blue or violet. The chemical molecule that gives the carrot its orange color is called beta-carotene. Beta-carotene absorbs light between 400nm and 500nm with a peak at 470nm. Having a look at our additive color schema we will see that the complementary color of blue is yellow. Now is that not only blue, but a wide range of light between 400nm and 500nm is absorbed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/h90irk9s7/carotene.gif\" width=\"518\" height=\"150\"/></center>\n<p>So when light hits the electrons of beta-carotene the electrons move from HOMO to LUMO and adsorb the light between 400nm and 500nm. This is the wavelength needed to promote the electron with the exact amount to energy needed. &nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/uot71t3j3/homolumo.png\" width=\"619\" height=\"217\"/></center>\n<p>Note: The electron moves back from LUMO to HOMO. The energy from the light used to promote the electron from HOMO to LUMO can be emitted in form of radiation or heat. In summer we all notice that black material gets warmer than bright. This is because the complete wavelength of the VIS is absorbed and emitted as heat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Transforming waves to information &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Now that we know how the light is absorbed by objects we need to examine how our eyes work. Without the human eye we wouldn\u2019t see anything, that\u2019s for sure. But how are we able to distinguish colors and brightness? Our retina has approximately 6 million cones and 120 million rods. When the reflected light hits our retina these cells become active. <br>\n We have three different type of cone cells, S(-hort), M-(medium) and L-(ong) cones. Short, medium and long refer to the wavelength the cell is responding to. The rods however can work with different wavelengths and thus do not matter when it comes to color. They are responsible for brightness and become active when there is less light. While the cones are active and working we speak of photopic vision, responsible for color sight. Scotopic vision is the terminus for sight in low light and only seeing in shades of gray. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/vi5wzz509/retina.jpg\" width=\"914\" height=\"430\"/></center><center><em>Fig. 2. Eye and retinal profile. Source: </em><a href=\"http://cdn.kevinmd.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/retina.jpg\"><em>Kevinmd</em></a></center>\n<p>As described the human retina has three kinds of cones. Each sensitive to a different wavelength. The following illustrations depicts the relation of wavelength and cones. These three cones together make it possible that we see colors. By combining cones we are able to see over 200 million different colors. &nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/jxtaq6apr/conesrods.jpg\" width=\"1225\" height=\"800\"/></center><center><em>Fig. 3. Spectral sensitivity of the receptor (rods and cones). Source: </em><a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sensory_Systems/Visual_System\"><em>Wikibooks; Sensory Systems</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></center>\n<h3><strong>So when light hits a cone it becomes activated. How does this activation work?</strong><br>\n&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>This is a very complex biochemical process I will try to explain without going too much into detail since we could do several posts just about this process. However we will have a look at the basic. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both, cones and rods contain a light-sensitive receptor protein called Rhodopsin, also known as visual purple. Under the influence of light Rhodopsin decomposes into Opsin and trans-Retinal. This process repeats and creates a cascade. The end of the processes results in regulating a molecule named Glutamat. The cells behind the retina turn these signals into nerve impulses to make it processable for the human brain. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for reading the first part of </em><em><strong>Life Explorers - The Human Senses,</strong></em><em> Don't miss the next part. <br>\nDo you have an questions or suggestions?

They look at one figure inside the class within their vision and that make the view limited in their eyes. But let switch the roles and try to see how the teacher look at their student in that big vision. Looking to a speaker is different than observing the reader. Chapter one in the book \u201cTeachers, Schools, and Society\u201d by David Miller Sadker and Karen R. Zittleman, discuss how teacher scenery is different from that of student and it guides the reader to find the positive and negative points for a teacher to encounter in his career; it will help reader to discover whether they should complete aiming for to become a teacher.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal for every reader is to find and choose the best career that will find happiness and bring the joy while practicing it. That\u2019s what makes the chapter more comfortable to read in; it didn\u2019t force the material on the reader but instead, it gives suggestions and real life examples about how being a teacher would look like. \u201cYou be the Judge\u201d is whole examples for a student to know how being a teacher could have a negative or positive impact on their lives, and it\u2019s a good way to them clarify their position whether to continue with being a teacher as a career meant to them or not convinced by. Also, there was a survey in the chapter that shows how many teachers get paid yearly in different states; it\u2019s a good side to the students to know that being a teacher could provide a decent life for them as a job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers need to have a bunch of specification in orders to be called a successor. Preparing a teacher to this career and guiding them to be effective to his class is an important step that could impact the whole future of both teachers and learner. That idea of preparation considers as an informative process and not implicit, and it\u2019s a good topic that's been clarified in that chapter. Moreover, another idea that been addressed at the end of the chapter is how the student could improve his skills and concepts of the learning process before graduation, and that been shown with listing several steps that the student should put into consideration in order to become successful and creative. It does not only help the learner himself in the long run but also give a chance to make his future classes more creative and cooperative at the time. For instance, some of the steps say that the teacher should study their courses that the handle carefully and planned for them ahead to make sure it\u2019s clear to him and would be to students at the time. Also, they should have a good impression during their learning process and to keep on building it on. That\u2019s how a student could have some ideas to consider and to begin with if they are struggling with what to start with or improve while they are still learning about their career.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students should figure out if the teaching career is the one that meant to them and they will enjoy practicing end for most of their life. That chapter did a good job in discussing some topic that will help the student take their decision regarding this career and if they willing to take that challenge and start filling and building their knowledge. It does not only help the student to become successful teachers but also prepare them to make a more bright future for the generation they will be willing to teach, and to be creative with their work and thoughts. So, after knowing and considering what a teacher need to handle and think of, the student will start to find their own way to teach and make their job process different from other teachers they encounter before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

Many projects are being launched, &nbsp;and the whales are putting in a lot of effort to notice the new aspiring writers.</p>\n<p>I have changed my view on things now, &nbsp;I make a point to read as many posts as possible. I comment if needed, and I upvote a post if I find it interesting. We are not in a race here. We are after all in the business of finding new undiscovered talent and to be heard. Now, also said, that what interests me, <em><strong>might not be interesting to you at all.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p>What I have noticed is that there are quite a few nasty people on steemit. I am certainly not going to call them by their names, but I really feel sorry for these people, as they would not give someone the time of day.</p>\n<p><em>I felt very offended by some of the comments made about my post, but realised that negative feedback can be changed into a positive view.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><strong>I do not promote or upvote a post just for the sake of upvoting.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I &nbsp;do my fair share by reading as many posts as possible about my interests.&nbsp;</strong>Now, also said, that what interests me, <em><strong>might not be interesting to you at all.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>But people are just people.</strong></em>............people&nbsp;should try and upvote the good posts and promote these writers, so we can have new and exciting reading material here on Steemit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you do not succeed today, tomorrow is a new day. Try harder. Do not let negative comments make you lose your way. Don't give up. <em><strong>Stay positive.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Because if you are noticed by the right person, then your posts will mean something. Then you will have a voice.</strong></em></p>\n<p>I am totally up for a good debate and if you don't agree with me on posts, then&nbsp;feel free to contact me and we can discuss your opinion. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If you like my posts please follow me on<a href=\"https://steemit.com/@serioustruth\">@serioustruth</a><br>\nTogether we can change the world. Feel free to share or promote my posts. I want to make a difference to the way people think.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2764<strong>Keep on steeming!</strong></p>\n</html>",

Well, as we shall come to see, it didn\u2019t. But, to the extent that some modern Literalists believe that there is a single agreed-upon, infallible book of scripture, it is due, in their view, to the concept of \u201cdivine inspiration\u201d\u2014the idea that God\u2019s hand directed both the writing and the compilation of the Bible over hundreds of years.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But, is this idea of divine inspiration a reasonable one? As suggested in the prior chapter, if God had intended for us to look to a history book for our spiritual salvation, he certainly should have, dare I say would have, made his intentions plainer, no? As Professor Ehrman notes:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It is one thing for believers to affirm, on theological grounds, that the decisions about the canon, like the books themselves, were divinely inspired, but it is another thing to look at the actual history of the process and to ponder the long, drawn-out arguments over which books to include and which to reject. The process did not take a few months or years. It took centuries. And even then there was no unanimity. (Lost Christianities at 230)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Because few lay Christians have ever done so, let\u2019s examine this drawn-out process in more detail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>The Gospels</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Much of the early arguments over the Bible centered upon which gospels should be included, and which excluded, from the New Testament. After all, as previously noted, there were far more gospels in circulation than merely the four known to our Bibles today:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>The greatest difficulty was in choosing the Gospels, and after much controversy, four were chosen: three, those of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are synopses of Jesus\u2019 life, while John\u2019s Gospel concentrates on a few specific miracles performed by Christ. (Solomon J. Schepps, Foreward to the 1979 edition of Lost Books of the Bible at 9)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Limiting the Gospels to only four was very important to some early Literalist leaders, although other Literalists and most Gnostics opposed this limitation, and the rationale for it was strained at best.</strong> Irenaeus, who we met in the last chapter, was one of the earliest and most vehement proponents of a four gospel canon, arguing that, \u201cit is not possible that there can be more or fewer than four\u201d for \u201c just as there are four regions of the universe, and four principal winds\u201d there must be only four gospels. Though hardly compelling, this rationale has been frequently cited over the centuries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Later orthodox Literalists, who ultimately assumed control over the selection process (as we will discuss below), did offer more rational justifications for limiting the gospels to four: They deemed some of the additional ones to be merely supplementary or redundant and therefore unnecessary, while they viewed others, particularly those without a Literalist bent, as outright heretical:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Of the accounts of the life of Jesus that were rejected by the Fathers, many were considered supplementary rather than false. Such was the case with the Gospels of Peter and Nicodemus and the two accounts of Christ\u2019s infancy (I and II Infancy)\u2026.</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Peter\u2019s Gospel, which was once held as high as those of Matthew and Mark, and more highly than those of Luke and John, was ultimately rejected because it differs too much in its details from the three chosen synopses. The Gospel of Thomas, one of the Nag Hammadi documents, was rejected for a very different reason. It opens by saying that he who understand the words of Jesus will be saved. This, of course, is in direct contradiction to the chosen Gospels\u2026which say that it is he who believes that will be saved\u2026. (Forward to the 1979 edition of Lost Books of the Bible at 9-10)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>The last of the \u201cchosen\u201d gospels, often called the fourth gospel, was that of John. But the modern reader may be surprised to learn that many early Christians disapproved of it selection:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Even its first generation of readers disagreed as to whether John was a true gospel or a false one\u2014and whether it should be part of the New Testament. John\u2019s defenders among early Christians revered it as the \u201clogos gospel\u201d\u2014the gospel of the divine word or reason (logos, in Greek)\u2014and derided those who opposed it as \u201cirrational\u201d (alogos, lacking reason). Its detractors, by contrast, were quick to point out that John\u2019s narrative differs significantly from those of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. [A]t crucial moments in its account, for example, John\u2019s gospel directly contradicts the combined testimony of the other New Testament gospels. (Elaine Pagels, Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas at 34-35)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Even so, because it can be bent to a Literalist interpretation, John\u2019s gospel came to be accepted as canon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>By way of contrast, the Gospel of Peter--a book much prized by most early Christians, rivaling in popularity the Gospels of Matthew and Mark and exceeding Luke and John--was ultimately rejected because it lent itself to a potentially \u201cheretical\u201d interpretation known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism\">docetism</a>. Although it came in a variety of forms, docetism can be understood for purposes of this book as the belief that Christ\u2019s divine nature kept him from experiencing true pain and suffering during his life and death. Serapion (c. 199), the orthodox Bishop of Antioch, (c. 199), concluded that because the Gospel of Peter could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with orthodox teachings (which held that Jesus suffered in the ordinary sense), it could not have been written by the Apostle Peter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>While modern scholarship has confirmed that the Gospel of Peter was not written by the historical Peter, Serapion\u2019s rationale for dismissing it should concern those who assert the Bible\u2019s infallibility. Serapion discarded the book simply because he disagreed with it, not because he had any actual evidence or knowledge of forgery. Thus, in Serapion\u2019s approach we see the beginnings of an orthodox \u201clitmus test\u201d for determining the authenticity of early Christian manuscripts\u2014those that largely agreed with the orthodox position, or could be interpreted or easily edited to do so, were frequently held to be authentic, while those that outright contradicted orthodox views were always discarded as forgeries.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Renowned scholar Bruce M. Metzger, PhD, acknowledges that the compilers of the Bible applied just such a litmus test. According to Metzger, for a book to be considered canonical it must have met three tests:</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>First, the books must have had apostolic authority\u2014that is, they must have been written either by apostles themselves, who were eyewitnesses to what they wrote about, or by followers of apostles.</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>[S]econd, there was the criterion of conformity to what was called the rule of faith. That is, was the document congruent with the basic Christian tradition that the [orthodox] church recognized as normative?&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>And third, there was the criterion of whether a document had had continuous acceptance and usage by the church at large. [Quoted in The Case For Christ at 66]</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>Other scholars have noted that the litmus test came in four parts rather than three, recognizing an additional requirement that the book be \u201cancient\u201d. But regardless, it is the second test, the \u201crule of faith\u201d, that is most intriguing to critical scholars.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>The \u201crule of faith\u201d, sometimes called the \"standard of faith\" rested on the now questionable assumption that the orthodox view of Christianity represented the exclusive authentic tradition.</strong> Under this standard, any early Christian document that contradicted the orthodox understanding was considered by the orthodox Literalists of the second and third centuries to be a forgery. <strong>For instance, the Gospel of Peter met every prong of the orthodox litmus test noted above save one\u2014the \u201crule of faith\u201d. After all, it was ostensibly written by the Apostle Peter and it was widely used and considered authentic by a great number of Christians, proving itself to be even more popular than Luke or John. The simple fact is that we don\u2019t read the Gospel of Peter in our Bibles today only because parts of it could not be reconciled with certain orthodox teachings and, as we shall see, it was the orthodox who compiled our Bibles.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Perhaps this rationale for excluding the Gospel of Peter and other books is acceptable to those who take it on faith that the orthodox tradition was the true and complete one, but it is troublesome for those who know otherwise. After all, <strong>the reasoning employed by the early orthodox is circular: \u201cWe\u2019re right and they are wrong\u201d, contended the orthodox leaders who compiled our Bibles. \u201cSo those manuscripts that agree with us are obviously authentic, while those that do not are certainly forgeries. Therefore we shall create a collection of the \u2018authentic\u2019 teachings, and then we can point to the authenticity of this collection as proof that our interpretation of Christianity is the right one.\u201d One doesn\u2019t have to be a logician to find the holes in that reasoning.</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>The Letters</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the debate over the Bible wasn\u2019t limited to the Gospels alone, but included the New Testament letters (epistles) as well. Several of the epistles in our present-day Bibles were not well respected by important early Christians, even some Literalist ones. <strong>In Origen\u2019s (c. 210) catalogue of New Testament scriptures, the Epistles of James and Jude are omitted, and Origen notes that many Christians were skeptical of 2 Peter and 2 and 3 John. More than a hundred years later, Eusebius (c. 315) states that some Christians of his time still doubted or outright rejected the authenticity of these same five books. Eusebius himself considered Revelation to be spurious. Jerome (c. 382) spoke dubiously of the epistle to the Hebrews. As late as the fifth century, the Syrian church venerated only 22 books, excluding 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude and Revelation. By contrast, the present day Ethiopian church accepts all twenty-seven books of our present day New Testament, but adds four more.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>The famous fourth century teacher known as Didymus the Blind was among those who believed that 2nd Peter was a forgery. Interestingly though, he cited the Shepard of Hermas and other noncanonical books favorably.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>The last book of the Bible, Revelation, is not included in the various catalogues of the New Testament offered by such notable early Christians as Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 340); the Bishops at the Council of Caudices (c. 364); Gregory Nazianzen, Bishop of Constantinople (c. 375); and Philastrius, Bishop of Brixia in Venice (c. 380).&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>In short, as late at 400 CE there was no accepted, universal canon of Christian scripture. And, as we shall soon see, there still isn\u2019t even today.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Forgery, Forgery Everywhere</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Forgery was commonly practiced in ancient times, so early Christians had reason to be skeptical when their opponents pointed to various manuscripts to \"cinch\" their argument. And as we shall see, we have even more reasons to be skeptical of these same manuscripts today.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Arguing in support of the integrity of our modern Bibles, Literalists often cite the research of critical scholars who have proven many of the excluded texts, such as the once-prized Gospel of Peter, to be forgeries (i.e., it was not really written by the historical Peter). But, these Literalists overlook the fact that these very same scholars have also shown several of our New Testament letters to be forgeries:</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Scholars have long recognized that even some of the books accepted into the canon are probably forgeries. Christian scholars, of course, have been loathe to call them that and so more commonly refer to them as \u201cpseudonymous\u201d writings. Possibly this is a more antiseptic term, but its does little to solve the problem of a potential deceit, for an author who attempts to pass off his own writing as that of some other well-know person has written a forgery. That is no less true of the book allegedly written to Titus that made it into the New Testament (Paul\u2019s Letter to Titus) than of the book allegedly written by Titus that did not (Pseudo-Titus), both claiming to be written by apostles (Paul and Titus), both evidently written by someone else. (Ehrman, Lost Christianities at 9)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>In fact, all of Paul\u2019s New Testament \u201cPastoral letters\u201d--1 and 2 Timothy and Titus--are now known to have been written long after Paul\u2019s death, very likely in the late first century. &nbsp;Among the New Testament books attributed to Paul, only Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, 1 Thessalonians, Philippians, Romans, and Philemon are universally recognized by critical and \u201cfaithful\u201d scholars alike as authentic.</strong> Ephesians, Colossians and 2 Thessalonians are sometimes disputed, but the definite consensus of critical scholars is that they are either fabrications or severely edited versions of some now lost originals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Although I cannot document here all of the various, compelling reasons why critical scholars are so sure that many New Testament epistles are faked, I will take a moment here discuss the Pastorals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In addition to the skepticism expressed by early prominent Christians and church fathers like those noted in the previous section above, the earliest extant catalogue of Paul\u2019s letters makes no mention at all of the Pastorals. Indeed, there is no evidence of their existence prior to c. 190 when Irenaeus conveniently makes mention of them. And yet, even despite these references by Irenaeus, Eusebius (c. 300), the so-called \u201cFather of Church History\u201d, does not include the Pastorals in his catalogue of the books of sacred scripture, even though he definitely knew of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But modern scholars have many additional reasons for doubting the authenticity of the Pastorals. For one, they curiously reference aspects of church structure and hierarchical governance that, although favored by the orthodox, did not exist during Paul\u2019s lifetime. The structure of church governance discussed in the Pastorals (a top-down hierarchy) is in many ways inconsistent and irreconcilable with the organizational structure of Paul\u2019s churches described in his authentic writings (which took a more democratic, bottom-up presbyterian approach).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Additionally, the vocabulary and tone of the Pastorals is curious. They use a number of words not found elsewhere in Paul\u2019s authentic writings, and specifically contradict the teachings of the known authentic writings on many points. Not surprisingly, these points of contradiction typically advance an orthodox understanding of Christianity, with the Pastorals apparently serving to \u201cclarify\u201d those parts of Paul\u2019s authentic writings that lent themselves to a Gnostic, \"heretical\" interpretation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>For these and other reasons, critical scholars are in near unanimous agreement that the Pastorals are second century forgeries, and rather poor ones at that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Circumstantial Evidence of Forgery</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Although the most \u201cfaithful\u201d of Literalist attempt to dispute the direct evidence of forgery noted above--rationalizing, for example, that the unusual vocabulary of the Pastorals might be attributable to the fact that Paul may have dictated his various letters at different times to different scribes who sometimes paraphrased him (while nonetheless perfectly preserving his \"divinely inspired\" message, we are assured)--<strong>there can be no dispute on the following point: To advance their cause, certain highly educated proto-orthodox forgers authored letters in the names of the Apostles or their followers, letters that their descendants eventually excluded from the Bible for one reason or another. </strong>For example, as mentioned previously, some orthodox sympathizer forged a letter from Titus, now called \u201cPseudo-Titus\u201d (meaning \u201cfalse Titus\u201d), that is not found in our New Testament. Extra-biblical documents forged in the name of the Apostle Paul include 3 Corinthians (created in the second century largely in order to undermine the docetic \u201cheresy\u201d, it was eventually accepted as canonical only by the Armenian church and certain Syrian churches), several letters from Paul to the Roman philosopher Seneca (designed to cast Paul as a great philosopher), and at least one to the church at Laodicea. Yet other known Pauline forgeries are lost to history\u2014we know them only because they are referenced in ancient writings that have been preserved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Faithful readers should not be surprised that all these letters were being forged in Paul\u2019s name. After all, 2 Thessalonians (2:2) records that Paul was concerned that people were forging letters in his name even in his own time. However:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>In an interesting twist, scholars today are not altogether confident that 2 Thessalonians itself was written by Paul. And so we have a neat irony: either 2 Thessalonians was written by Paul and someone else was producing forgeries in Paul\u2019s name, or 2 Thessalonians itself is a forgery that condemns the production of forgeries in Paul\u2019s name. Either way, someone was forging books in Paul\u2019s name. (Lost Christianities at 10)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Although these undisputed forgeries weren\u2019t included in our New Testaments, to the relief of many Literalists, their mere existence casts additional doubt on many of the books that did. These extra-biblical forgeries prove indisputably that some early, highly-educated proto-orthodox sympathizers--members of the very group whose spiritual descendants ultimately organized and canonized the New Testament as Holy Writ (as we shall see)--were ready, willing, and able to employ deceit to advance their cause and to undermine the authority of their Christian opponents, going even so far as to forge letters in the name of key Apostles. Even the Catholic Encyclopedia admits as much: \"Both Catholics and Gnostics were concerned in writing these fictions. The former had no motive other than that of pious fraud.\" Gnostic forgeries were then presumably \"impious frauds.\"&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Combine this known and admitted propensity for forgery with the doctrine-based litmus test later adopted by their descendants for purposes determining the authenticity of ancient Christian documents, and it would be a divinely inspired miracle indeed if some forgeries didn\u2019t make it into our New Testaments.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>So, even if we ignore the all-but-conclusive direct evidence of forgery within our New Testament, we have compelling circumstantial evidence as well: We know with certainty that the Literalist Church had the means to commit forgery, as evidenced by, among other things, their extant forgeries that did not make it into the New Testament. We also know that the Literalists had the motive to forge documents and include them in the canon (e.g., by forging documents in Apostles\u2019 names and designating those documents as the infallible Word of God, Literalists would gain an advantage in the battles for the heart and soul of early Christianity). Finally, Literalists had the opportunity to include forged documents in the Bible: A century or two after these documents were forged, the spiritual descendants of these Literalist forgers attempted to \"close the cannon\" and adpoted a doctrine-based litmus test of authenticity that all but assured some forged documents would be canonized.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In light of this evidence, it is only the most \u201cfaithful\u201d of Christians who deny that parts of the New Testament are obvious forgeries. Sadly, such \u201cfaithfulness\u201d borders on irrationality: It is not merely \u201cevidence of things unseen\u201d (as Paul defined faith), but the irrational rejection of things seen plainly. It is not merely an acceptance of the unprovable, but acceptance in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Why should anyone have such faith? More importantly, why would a benevolent, loving God have made such irrational faith a precondition of salvation? I can think of no reason at all, but I can, and have, identified many reasons why less than benevolent, power-driven humans did so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Bibles, Bibles Everywhere</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Even if we ignore the known forgeries in the New Testament, there are many other problems with Literalist claims of the Bible's infallibility. One is that, as previously alluded, there is simply no such thing as the Bible. <strong>Over centuries what we now call the Bible has undergone numerous changes, and \"the\" church has never enjoyed a definitive version. </strong>For example, the identity of the books comprising the Old Testament has changed over the years, the Apocrypha was dropped from the Protestant Bible altogether after the Council of Trent (1545-1563) and, as we have seen, the books of the New Testament weren\u2019t fixed until the late fourth century or early fifth century, and even then there still wasn\u2019t complete unanimity in Christendom. <strong>The Catholic Encyclopedia admits, \"The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning...has no foundation in history.\"&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Another problem with claims of biblical infallibility is that, even today (and ignoring disputes over which books are canonical) we have numerous versions of \u201cthe\u201d Bible. <strong>Just since the King James Version was first published in the early 1600\u2019s, English speaking peoples have seen more than three hundred English translations of the Bible alone! </strong>A trip to the local bookstore will acquaint the reader with some of these, and a somewhat more comprehensive listing can be found here.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>So, why the need for so many Bibles?</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>Well, different versions exist for two primary reasons: (1) scholars disagree about which of the ancient manuscripts should be translated into our modern Bibles, and (2) translators disagree as to how to properly translate a given manuscript into a language understandable by modern audiences. Let\u2019s discuss each of these disagreements, beginning with the last one first.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Difficult Translations</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Jesus and his immediate followers, like most Jews of Palestine for centuries before them, spoke Aramaic, a language that is all but dead today. However, the oldest complete New Testament manuscripts still in existence are all written in an ancient form of Greek, called \u201cKoine\u201d, and all of these oldest manuscripts are \u201cuncials\u201d, meaning that they are written in only capital Greek letters with no spaces between words, no line breaks, and almost no punctuation marks\u2014i.e., no periods, no commas, no page breaks, and no exclamation points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>These facts are important for several reasons. First, they demonstrate that, with only a few exceptions, even the oldest existing copies of the New Testament capture the words of Jesus and the Apostles only in translated form. </strong>We do not know the actual words that were originally spoken by Jesus and his Apostles in Aramaic, rather we have only a Greek hearsay translation. And, unfortunately, something is always lost in translation: As Rabbi Judah eloquently stated, \u201cHe who translates a biblical verse literally is a liar, but he who elaborates on it is a blasphemer.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The translator\u2019s job is to express in language understandable to his audience the meaning of words originally spoken or written by someone else using a different language. Given linguistic differences in grammar, syntax, punctuation and figures of speech, this is no easy task under the best of circumstances\u2014but, Bible translators face additional complications. NAMELYTHEYARECHARGEDWITHACCURATELYTRANSLATINGANCIENTMANUSCRIPTSTHATAREWRITTENINALLCAPSDEVOIDOFPUNTUATIONORSPACESANDTHATWEREWRITTENTHOUSANDSOFYEARSAGOINLANGUAGEORDIALECTSTHATHAVEBEENDEADFORCENTURIES.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>If that last \"all caps\" sentence didn\u2019t make any sense, it is only because I wrote it in uncial form in hopes of giving the reader some appreciation for the difficult task of translating ancient uncials. Here\u2019s what I actually said: \u201cNamely they are charged with accurately translating ancient manuscripts that were written in all caps, which are virtually devoid of punctuation marks or spaces, and that were written thousands of years ago in languages or dialects that have been dead for centuries.\" If the reader had difficulty making sense of the \"all caps\" phrase above (even though it was written in modernEnglish), imagine how much greater the difficulty of interpreting a dead, foreign language written in such a manner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The first step in any translation of an ancient document is to develop an understanding of the original author\u2019s intent. As anyone who has ever attempted to interpret a document knows, this is more art than science, especially when the original author has been dead for two millennia, came from a foreign culture, and spoke a dead language. Given the difficultly that each present day generation has in understanding the next one (and vice versa), imagine how much more difficult it must be for a modern translator to truly see the world through the eyes of a first century writer from another culture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>In short, despite their best efforts, a translator\u2019s presuppositions (paradigms) affect his or her understanding of the original writer\u2019s intent, and therefore taint his or her interpretation of the original writer\u2019s words. The Preface to the New King James Version of the Bible, which is itself \u201cthe fifth revision of a historic document translated from specific Greek texts\u201d, is to be commended for acknowledging as much explicitly:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>[T]he most important differences in the English New Testaments of today are due\u2026to the way in which translators view the task of translation: How literally should the [original] text be rendered? How does the translator view the matter of biblical inspiration? Does the translator adopt a paraphrase when a literal rendering would be quite clear and more to the point?\u201d [parentheticals and emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>In other words, as the preface to the New King James version makes clear, the meaning of the translated Bible varies according to the particular translator\u2019s presuppositions, including whether or not the translator presupposes that the Bible is a spiritual book written by mortals, or a divinely inspired book of history. Or, said another way, the Paradigm of Historicity affects the translation! In this manner, centuries of translator bias (until very recently, almost exclusively Literalist ones) have been not-so-subtly incorporated into the substance of the most Bible versions available to us today. We will expose many of these as we proceed.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Assuming a translator can overcome the first challenge of truly understanding the intent of the original writer, the second step in translation is to then render the that understanding in language comprehensible to the translator\u2019s audience. The Christian William Tyndale was the first translator to offer an English Bible (c. 1526) derived from the most ancient Greek manuscripts available at the time (rather than later Latin manuscripts that had served as the basis for most previous translations). For this, he was eventually burned at the stake for heresy. Even so, many of his words survive to this day. It was Tyndale who, via artful translation, created from whole cloth many of the most memorable words and phrases found in our modern Bibles:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It was Tyndale who established \u2026that the Bible should not be in the language of scholars but in the spoken language of the people. [H]e coined such words as \u201cPassover,\u201d \u201cscapegoat,\u201d \u201cmercy seat,\u201d and \u201clong-suffering.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote><br></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Many expressions of Tyndale are also unforgettable, cherished by countless readers of the English Bible: \u201cthe kingdom of heaven is at hand\u201d (Matt. 3:2); \u201cthe pinnacle of the temple\u201d (Matt. 4:5); \u201cthe salt of the earth\u201d (Matt. 5:13); \u201cdaily bread\u201d (Matt. 6:11); \u201cConsider the lilies of the field, how they grow\u201d (Matt. 6:28); \u201cmeek and lowly in heart\u201d (Matt 11:29); \u201cshepherds abiding in the field\u201d (Luke 2:8); \u201ceat, drink, and be merry\u201d (Luke 12:19); \u201cfatted calf\u201d (Luke 15:23); \u201conly begotten son\u201d (John 1:14, 18); \u201cin my Father\u2019s house are many mansions\u201d (John 14:2); \u201cin whom we live and move and have our being\u201d (Acts 17:28); \u201cGod forbid\u201d (Rom 3:4); \u201csounding brass\u201d and \u201ctinkling cymbal\u201d (1 Cor. 13:1); \u201cin the twinkling of an eye\u201d (1 Cor. 15:52); \u201csinging and making melody (Eph. 5:19); \u201coffice of a bishop\u201d (1 Tim. 3:1); \u201cthe pleasures of sin for a season\u201d (Heb. 11:25); \u201can advocate with the Father\u201d (1 John 2:1); and \u201cBehold, I stand at the door and knock\u201d (Rev 3:20). (How We Got the Bible at 178-179)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Despite their familiarity, the above expressions do not appear in the original Greek, at least not in so many words:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>[I]t is noteworthy that these expressions could have been translated differently from the Greek text, yet because Tyndale had such an ear for the English language, these [para]phrases live on. [parentheticals added]. (How We Got the Bible at 179)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In short, as previously stated, something is always lost (and sometimes added)in translation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>An Important Diversion to Discuss Misleading Translations&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Before moving on to discuss the second primary reason that there are so many versions of the Bible\u2014namely, disagreements over which ancient documents to translate,--its worth pausing here to explore the significance of translator bias. <strong>Until very recently, virtually all Bible translations were overseen by committed Christians steeped in the Literalist, orthodox tradition. Even most of the so-called heretics of the last thousand years were, like William Tyndale, Literalists. Consequently, the Paradigm of Historicity, and all orthodox doctrines derived therefrom, weighed heavily on their efforts, and the biases of these original translators have influenced subsequent translations ever since.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Translators who presuppose that the Bible is the \u201cinspired\u201d word of God naturally \u201cview the task of translation\u201d, if only unconsciously, as supporting this idea.</strong> <strong>Such translators assume that God\u2019s inspired Word simply can\u2019t contradict itself or contain error. Thus, centuries of translators have adopted interpretations and translations that seek to reconcile or downplay inconsistencies or discrepancies that are evident in the original tongue. For example:</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>All of the Gospels present but one view of Jesus, that he is the Son of God. Yet in presenting this view their individual descriptions of him and his sayings often employ different words. Through the years, these verbal distinctions, either intentionally or unintentionally, tended to be \u201charmonized\u201d by the scribes. Thus it is a sound conclusion that in parallel accounts the text which preserves the minute verbal differences is generally the [more authentic] text. (How We Got the Bible at 93)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The result of this translator and scribal bias for consistency is that some parts of our modern Bibles appear to modern readers to be more of a coherent whole than they actually are, while other parts appear to less of a whole than they should. The following pages will provide numerous examples of the former, but here I will note one very basic example of the latter:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>\u201cJesus\u201d is the Greek rendering of the Hebrew name \u201cJoshua\u201d, meaning \u201csavior.\u201d It was a very common name among first century Jews. And yet it has become customary among translators to render the name of the Old Testament hero of Exodus as \u201cJoshua\u201d and that of the New Testament hero of the same name as \u201cJesus\u201d. Inconsistently translating these names adds to Jesus\u2019 uniqueness while at the same time obscuring certain similarities in the lives and actions of the two biblical heroes that may otherwise be obvious. The differing nomenclature discourages the reader from drawing analogies between the lives of the two figures, analogies that the authors of the gospels almost certainly intended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Translator bias has also served to obscure some striking similarities between the New Testament and other Gnostic scriptures. The Bible is almost always rendered in the familiar \u201cchurch speak\u201d originally adopted by Literalist translators over the centuries. However, it\u2019s important to understand that identical Greek words and ideas appearing in surviving Gnostic writings are typically rendered in unfamiliar \u201cpagan\u201d, heretical language, or simply left un-translated altogether, making these works seem more foreign, bizarre, and incredible than they should. To illustrate the point, let\u2019s consider just how strange, dare I say Gnostic, parts of the New Testament sound if we translate them from the Greek using the same principles often employed when translating Gnostic manuscripts.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Greek word for wisdom is \u201cSophia\u201d, which is also the name of the Greek goddess that personified the same. In Gnostic mythology, Sophia was the companion and lover of the Logos (often translated as \u201cword\u2019, which we will discuss more below), which all Christians equate with Christ (thanks to the opening chapter of the fourth gospel). This may be one reason why translators almost always translate the Greek word \u201cSophia\u201d as simply \u201cwisdom\u201d in the New Testament, but as \u201cSophia\u201d in most Gnostic texts. But is such inconsistent treatment justified? <strong>What happens, for example, when we translate some familiar Bible passages using principals of translation traditionally applied to Gnostic texts? Let\u2019s begin with words attributed to Paul in Colossians 1:8 (highlighted words are those that have been reworded using more consistently applied principles of translation, as is done with non-canonical books from the time):</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>We proclaim [Christ]\u2026teaching every man in the ways of Sophia that each may become an initiated member of Christ. (Colossians 1:28)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Translated in this manner, and remembering that in Gnostic theology, Sophia was the lover of the Logos (Christ), Paul sounds\u2026well\u2026radical. In essence, Paul teaches that we become one with Christ (that is, \u201cmembers\u201d of Christ) by learning the ways (i.e., assuming the role) of his mythical lover, Sophia. Though strange, this lesson is actually consistent with orthodox doctrine that the church is the \u201cbride of Christ\u201d, and it is also indistinguishable from the Gnostic teaching on this subject.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Continuing:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>My purpose is that they may\u2026become one in love, so that they may\u2026experience the Gnosis of God\u2019s mystery, namely, Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of Sophia and Gnosis. [emphasis added] (Colossians 2:2-3)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Here Paul teaches that mystical \u201coneness\u201d is achieved through Gnosis (or experiential knowledge) of God\u2019s \u201cmystery\u201d, which he defines as Christ. Christ is not discussed as an historical personage, but as a higher consciousness that, once identified with to the exclusion of our ego (i.e., once we become one with it), leads to spiritual insight\u2014hidden wisdom (Sophia) and knowledge (gnosis). This is pure Christian Gnosticism, plain and simple. Only the common misleading translation keeps us from seeing it as such.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Proceeding further:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>We speak of Sophia among the initiated; not the Sophia of this aeon, nor of the rulers of this aeon, who are passing away; but we speak of God\u2019s Sophia in a mystery. (1 Corinthians 2:6)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It is central to our faith that in the end we will all attain Oneness through Gnosis of God\u2019s Son, becoming fully initiated human beings, equal to nothing less than the pleroma of Christ. (Ephesians 4:13)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>\u201cGod\u2019s Sophia\u201d, \u201cinitiated\u201d, \u201cmystery\u201d, \u201caeons\u201d, \u201coneness\u201d and \u201cpleroma\u201d, all of these are quintessentially Gnostic terms, terms one would find repeated over and over in most any Christian Gnostic texts such as those found at Nag Hammadi. And yet, although they are expressed in the original Greek manuscripts of our Bibles, these terms are foreign to most Christians simply because bias, primarily the doctrine of divine inspiration and the Paradigm of Historicity, keeps translators from expressing Paul in this way. Rather than use the word \u201cinitiated\u201d, which is a more proper and accurate translation of the original Greek, and one they surely would have used if translating the same word in a Gnostic text, translators substitute the word \u201cmature.\u201d Rather than use the Greek word \u201cGnosis\u201d, which describes subjective, experiential knowledge (like knowing how to ride a bike) as opposed to objective, intellectual knowledge (like one plus one equals two), translators just use the more antiseptic (if somewhat misleading) English word \u201cknowledge\u201d, which has the added benefit of obscuring Paul\u2019s Gnostic tendencies.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Another example of a translation that obscures the similarities between the Gnostic texts and the New Testament is the rendering of logos in many Gnostic texts as logos, but in the New Testament as \u201cWord\u201d (such as in John 1:1) The Greek word logos, which is the root of the English word \u201clogic\u201d, has no strict English equivalent. It can be alternatively translated as \u201cword\u201d, \u201creason\u201d, or \u201cidea\u201d depending upon context, but it actually contains elements of all three, plus more. No one English word captures the true essence of the Greek logos.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In the centuries before and immediately after Jesus, \"logos\" was a term of art used by pagan philosophers and adepts of the Mysteries Religions, including the Christian Gnostics. They generally used it to describe the thoughts of God\u2019s Mind through which God created and sustains the universe, or said another way, the objects of God\u2019s consciousness. To put it in terms readily understandable to most present-day Literalist Christians, before God spoke the words \u201cLet there by light\u201d (Genesis 1:3), God had to first have the idea (logos) of light in mind, else his words would have had no meaning or effect. Because thought, which is made manifest in words, must precede action, Gnostics came to view God\u2019s thoughts/ideas/words as the true source and sustainer of all Creation, present with God \u201cin the beginning\u201d, for creation could not exist prior to God conceiving of it. These divine thoughts or ideas, which are separate from God and yet one with Him (in the same sense that our thoughts are separate from our minds yet have no existence outside of them) are the divine logos. It will serve our purposes sufficiently if we conceptualize the divine logos for now as God\u2019s consciousness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In Gnostic mythology, which the reader will recall contains much figurative language, creation is the result of the one transcendent God becoming consciousness of Himself. Exactly how this happened is a mystery symbolized in numerous and varying myths, but Gnostics reasoned rightly that consciousness requires both a subject and an object\u2014that is, there must be a witness (the person or thing that is conscious\u2014i.e., the \u201cmind\u201d) as well as the witnessed (i.e., the person or thing of which on is conscious, or the \u201cthought\u201d). In the Gnostic allegorical myths that seek to encode this truth, Gnostics often referred to the original witness (i.e., the \u201cmind\u201d of God) as \u201cthe Father\u201d. Likewise, they referred to the thoughts of that Divine Mind, the ideas which God\u2019s Mind contemplates, as \u201cthe Son\u201d or \u201cthe Logos\u201d (Word). Thus, thoughts (the Son) were conceptualized as the \u201coffspring\u201d or \u201cfirst born\u201d or \u201cbegotten\u201d of the mind (the Father), present with God at the dawn of creation. Before God thought, nothing was, for consciousness did not exist. Thus, Father and Son are as inseparable as thought is from mind. The Athanasian Creed expresses these ideas perfectly:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten, The Son is of the Father alone, neither made nor created, but begotten. [N]one is afore or after the other, none is greater or less than another.</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And, as Origen once noted, \u201cThe Father did not beget the Son, but ever is begetting him.\u201d</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>The experience of this simple idea was almost certainly part of the fundamental Inner Mystery taught by all Gnostic Mystery Schools in the centuries before and after Jesus. Centuries before Christ the pagan Gnostic Heraclitus (c. 600 BCE) wrote, \u201cThe Father and Son are the same.\u201d According to Clement of Alexandria, the pagan Gnostic Euripides had years before \u201cdivined as in a riddle that the Father and the Son are one God.\u201d The legendary pagan sage Orpheus, who lived, if at all, thousands of years before Christ, is quoted by the Christian Clement of Alexandria as having taught:&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Behold the Logos divine. Tread well the narrow path of life and gaze on Him, the world\u2019s great ruler, our immortal king. (Quoted in The Jesus Mysteries at 83)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Clement of Alexandria himself writes:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>The Son is the Consciousness of God. The Father only sees the world as reflected in the Son. (Quoted in The Jesus Mysteries at 84) [parentheticals added]</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Continuing with this idea for a moment, it is important to note that Gnostics sought to explain the mystery of human consciousness by characterizing it as fragmented, dispersed pieces of the One Divine Consciousness\u2014that is, of the Son or logos, which Christians specifically equate with Christ. How portions of the One Divine Consciousness came to be dismembered and encapsulated within each of us, how we lost our ability to \u201caccess\u201d or \u201crely on\u201d it in our daily lives, and how we can regain it, are all mysteries described allegorically in many Gnostic and Christian myths. For Christians, the most important of these myths are those describing the Incarnation of Christ (God\u2019s consciousness becoming encapsulated in man), the Fall of Man (man losing his ability to rely on that consciousness and instead being ruled by his unconscious paradigms and passions, which Paul called \u201cthe flesh\u201d), and Christ\u2019s Crucifixion and Resurrection (describing the way back to union with God, or oneness with the cosmic consciousness).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>These Gnostic teachings about the dispersion of human consciousness, and its reunion with God, may seem quite strange to Literalists, so I will again remind the reader of just a few of Paul\u2019s words on this subject:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>For just as the body is a unity and yet has many members, and all the members, though many , form only one body, so it is with Christ\u2026.[i.e., the logos or Son]. For by means of one shared Spirit [or consciousness] we were all baptized into one [spiritual] body\u2026.&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Now you (collectively) are Christ\u2019s body [i.e., the Logos, the One Divine Consciousness], and individually members [i.e., dispersed pieces] of it. (1 Corinthians 12:11-27)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It is inherent in our faith that in the end we will all attain Oneness through Gnosis of God\u2019s Son, becoming fully initiated human beings, equal to nothing less than the pleroma [fullness] of Christ. [Ephesians 4:13 as rendered in Jesus and the Lost Goddess at 149))</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In Ephesians 4:25, Paul writes \u201c[w]e are all parts of one body and members one of another.\u201d In Colossians 1:25-28, Paul writes that his purpose in life is to reveal to us the Mystery that was hidden in past ages--namely, that Christ (i.e., the logos) is in us! In Galations 1:15, Paul writes that \u201cGod revealed his Son in me\u201d [emphasis added]. Demonstrating that he had come to identify completely with this higher consciousness within him, and ceased identifying with his ego, Paul states, \u201c[I]t is no longer I [i.e., my ego or \"flesh\"] who live, but Christ [the logos] lives in me; and the life I now live in this body I live by faith\u2014by reliance on and complete trust in the Son of God\u2026.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>As we have previously noted, Jesus offers the same teachings, most explicitly in the Gospel of John (17:19-26). There, Jesus prays that his followers will come to know their true nature. He prays that they will be \u201csanctified by the Truth\u201d so that they:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>all may be One--just as You, Father, are in Me and I in you, they also may be One in Us. [I] in them and You in Me, in order that they may become One and perfectly united....</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>And nowhere is this pre-Christian, Gnostic teaching of creation emerging from the oneness of God through the facility of the logos (which is then dispersed among all peoples) better illustrated than in the opening Chapter of the Gospel of John (v. 1-4):&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>In the beginning was the Logos [i.e., Divine Consciousness, or thoughts of God, confusingly translated as \u201cthe Word\u201d], and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things came into being by Him, and apart from him nothing came into being [i.e., nothing existed prior to God becoming conscious]. In him was the life and that life was the light [i.e., consciousness] of men.</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I could continue with innumerable examples of how misleading translations, warped as they are by the Paradigm of Historicity and doctrine of divine inspiration, have served to obscure similarities between Gnostic and Literalist texts. But the above is hopefully sufficient evidence for now that, properly translated and freed of the Paradigm of Historicity, large parts of the New Testament support, indeed demand, a Gnostic interpretation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>(to be continued in Chapter 5, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/god/@sean-king/reading-the-bible-is-like-picking-out-diamonds-from-dunghills-part-2\">Part 2</a>)</p>\n<h2><br></h2>\n</html>",

All STEEM Dollars for these posts go to the featured author.</strong></strike>\n\n<strike><strong>If you are looking to be featured as an author, please contact me via email - ben.adaptnetwork@gmail.com</strong></strike>\n\n<strong>Edit: From the comments, it seems that this type of author promotion is not the way to go. A 're-steemit' button has been suggested and I think this is a great idea.</strong>\n\n<hr>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6z5In5y.jpg\"/></center>\n\nIf you've played the indie-hit video game <a href=\"http://www.firewatchgame.com/\">FireWatch</a>, by Campo Santo, then chances are that you fell in love with the idea of staying in a fire tower, just as I have.\n\nThe American novelist and poet, Jack Kerouac, famously spent the summer of 1956 manning a fire tower on Washington\u2019s Desolation Peak, in the northern Cascades. Even though he was alone with pencil and paper by design, he didn\u2019t get much writing done. I don\u2019t blame him, the views from the tower are incredible and there\u2019s plenty to fill an adventurer\u2019s time for 63 days.\n\nSo, if the idea of a few days in the sky in a cool-looking fire tower is appealing, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that you can actually rent one of these bad boys.\n\nSince Jack Kerouac\u2019s stay in the 50s, new technologies have made fire lookouts mostly obsolete, some were even torn down. Others were left to rust and splinter, becoming squatter\u2019s dens and canvases for high-altitude graffiti artists. But dozens around the US have survived and are available for rent, evolving into modest sources of revenue for the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s depleted accounts. The Forest Fire Lookout Association maintains a list of available towers; many are available for as little as $20 a night.\n\n<strong>Lets take a look at a few below:</strong>\n\n<h2>1. Black Mountain Lookout, California</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tbHIiBQ.jpg\"/></center>\n\nBlack Mountain Lookout is located on the eastern edge of the Beckwourth Ranger District, 10 miles from Highway 395, near Milford, California.\n\nThe lookout was constructed in 1934 and is a great example of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) architecture. The C-3-type lookout is situated on a single story 10 foot tower and is extremely well-preserved.\n\nThe one-room lookout cabin is set on a tower, rising 10 feet above the ground. It is furnished with two single beds with mattresses, but can accommodate up to four people. There is also space for tent camping adjacent to the lookout, for up to four visitors.\n\n<strong>A closer look in pictures:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NX0S10Y.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HgS38WU.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ULzb0dV.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ljj8y7X.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>2. Hirz Mountain Lookout, California</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6z5In5y.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThis fire tower sits atop Hirz Mountain, California at an elevation of 3,540 feet, offering 360-degree views of Mt. Shasta\u2019s snow-laced peak to the north.\n\nThe McCloud River Wintu tribe held Hirz Mountain in reverence and had a name for it in their own language. But it was a miner, Henry Hirz, who gave the mountain its modern name.\n\nWhen the lookout was built, it was originally a structure that sat on the ground. The mountain was a strategic location for detecting fires because it had a direct view into the headwaters of the McCloud River and most of its tributaries. In 1937, the Forest Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps rebuilt the Hirz Mountain Lookout cabin and included a garage and outhouse. It was one of the last CCC-era lookouts to be built. In 1949, a steel tower was added, constructed of a steel K-brace tower that stands 20 feet above ground level.\n\n<strong>A quick look inside the tower:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uZq8dZ5.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZCHllVy.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>3. Hornet Lookout, Montana</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bD8F1wJ.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe Hornet Lookout is as old school as it gets and features a two-story construction. The ground level provides a living space for two guests and the second story is a small loft used solely for full views of the region. The lookout\u2019s rustic accommodations include a propane cook stove, propane lantern and a small wood stove for heat.\n\nThe lookout provides astounding 360-degree views of the surrounding terrain, including Glacier National Park and Kintla Lake on clear days. Apparently, on some nights, the Northern Lights may be seen from the lookout.\n\n<strong>A 'slightly' more modern look:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fbAMzHn.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>4. Fall Mountain Lookout Cabin, Oregon</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/EyIpkj8.jpg\"/></center>\n\nFall Mountain Lookout Tower is situated about 20 miles from John Day, in central Oregon. It provides 360-degree views of the surrounding Strawberry Mountain Wildness, as well as the towns of Seneca and Mt. Vernon.\n\nThe tower was built in 1933 and sits at an elevation of 5,949 feet. Before satellite surveillance systems, lookout personnel monitored the forest from this 18-foot perch for signs of smoke, alerting fire guards when necessary. Today guests can watch the sun rise and set, spot wildlife from the catwalk and witness dramatic thunderstorms that traverse the territory during summer months.\n\nThe one-room, 14-by-14 cabin sits atop an 18-foot tower and sleeps two. The cabin is furnished with a futon bed and a table and chairs. It has electricity and in the kitchen area, an electric stove and refrigerator.\n\n<strong>Here's a few more snaps:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fVoStKq.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/sUrDl58.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3CrgXdi.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LejQWOZ.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>5. Indian Ridge Lookout, Oregon</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/861cU5N.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe Indian Ridge Lookout sits at an elevation of 5,405 feet in the Willamette National Forest. Indian Ridge was named for the old Indian hunting trail that runs along the summit.\n\nBuilt in 1958, the lookout was used for firefighting by Forest Service personnel until 1973 and is still staffed occasionally during emergencies.\n\n<strong>A closer look inside the tower:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vBd3iLs.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DKt5G2z.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FJePMYG.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ULzb0dV.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>6. Little Guard Lookout, Idaho</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ifhnbPK.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe newest tower on this list, the Little Guard Lookout is located about 9 miles north of Shoshone Camp, was one of the last remaining fire lookouts used in the Coeur d\u2019Alene River area and has only just recently become inactive.\n\nThe structure standing today on Little Guard Peak is the third in a series of lookout buildings that originated back to 1919. In October 1990, Little Guard Lookout was accepted for listing in the National Historic Lookout Register and the first for Idaho.\n\nThe fully furnished two-story fire lookout has dimensions of 14 x 14 feet, an external cat walk, and a gabled roof. It sleeps four guests, but space is tight. The kitchen is on the ground floor and is equipped with a small propane refrigerator, propane cook stove, table, chairs and basic cooking utensils.\n\n<strong>A few more photos:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NXtu1ZE.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/pPy4Dxj.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wuBRx3w.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>7. Spruce Mountain Fire Lookout Tower</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dkazLmP.jpg\"/></center>\n\nPerched atop a forested mountain, Spruce Mountain Fire Lookout Tower offers panoramic views that include Medicine Bow Peak, Rob Roy Reservoir, Jelm Mountain and the southern end of the Snowy Range. After being occupied as a fire lookout, the 55-foot tall structure was renovated and opened to the public for overnight rental in 1977.\n\nThe lookout cabin is furnished with two single beds with mattresses and can accommodate up to four guests. Inside amenities include a table with chairs, cookware, dishes, utensils, cleaning supplies, a propane heater, propane cook stove and oven, propane refrigerator and propane lights.\n\n<em>All photos: courtesy <a href=\"http://www.recreation.gov/\">Recreation.gov</a></em>\n\n<strong>For more information on renting one of these towers visit <a href=\"http://www.firelookout.org/lookout-rentals.html\">firelookout.org</a>.

The second problem was the creation of very low-grade tobacco that some people refused to accept as payment. The policy ultimately created low tobacco prices for farmers. In 1682, there were riots and the tobacco crops of various farms were destroyed.</p>\n<p>The non-uniformity of a currency (apart from paper) is a not a trivial problem. Throughout history, it has been a significant issue. In colonial Plymouth, Massachusetts, the Wampanoag Tribe\u2019s wampum was made legal tender at the rate of six white beads or three purple beads per penny. Unfortunately, supply of beads was limited. It was hard for prices to rise in the sense that the bead, as an instrumentality, was not divisible.<sup>(1)</sup></p>\n<p>Historically, therefore, the government really needed to take over responsibility for coinage. That created another problem. How does one prevent the government from abusing the privilege by basically destroying the value of the currency by issuance?</p>\n<p>Enter Bitcoin. It is very hard to counterfeit since all Bitcoin in existence are always visible in the Blockchain ledger. Supply of Bitcoin is fixed; it is hardwired in the code. This is a possible revolution in currency design. If nothing else, it is a new asset class.</p>\n<p><em><sup>(1)</sup>Barry Eichengreen, Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System (New York: Oxford University Press, 2011), 9-10</em></p>\n<p>---------------------</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimers:</em></p>\n<p><em>Horizon Kinetics LLC (\u201cHorizon Kinetics\u201d) is the parent holding company to several SEC-registered investment advisors including Horizon Asset Management LLC, Kinetics Asset Management LLC, and Kinetics Advisers, LLC.

It's like being in a Kindergarten class full of 20-30 somethings.\n\nThis younger generation seems to worry more about figuring out how to make themselves into a Gawd, while at the same time arguing over which psychopathic authoritarian they are going to vote for as their supreme leader. They do more thinking about who to vote for to control their lives than they do how they are going to survive on their own for the next 40 years or more.\n\nhttps://s16.postimg.org/dqbzdofj9/OK_dees_1_Copy.jpg \n\nWhich one of these \"leaders\" (and I must quote that) is going to do more for me, seems to be the biggest question of younger generations. While at the same time they hold onto the belief that everything was created just for them and everyone else is merely a part of them; their own personal sock puppets of pleasure who must reward them when they do something they consider to be worthwhile.\n<br>\n\nhttps://cdn.meme.am/instances/57755618.jpg\n\n# Vaporware Is Skeery\n\nOne of my biggest disappointments in this community came when @stellabelle, the person with the highest reputation on the site, made a post about an announced feature she liked in another decentralized blogging platform that doesn't even exist. \n\n### The horror! \n\nMany were quick to point out that the other platform was \"vaporware\", yet felt so threatened by her post about this \"vaporware\" that they created fictional stories to apparently discredit her. Others jumped on the bandwagon at every chance in the comments section. For what? For pointing out an announced feature in \"vaporware\"? Some even called this apparent \"vaporware\" a \"competitor\"!?\n\nhttps://s11.postimg.org/e5699gp5v/cover_ears.jpg\n\n# [Faith No More](https://youtu.be/3yVI3UgtvwU)\n\nThis says a lot about the faith these people actually have in Steemit. The fact that a piece of  \"vaporware\" can be considered a \"competitor\" to Steemit, along with the fact that these people feel threatened by this \"vaporware\" would make Leon Festinger roll over in his grave; **because he's dead ... just like this generations ability to debate on a topic without their favorite psychology book in front of them to fashion a response from someone else's thoughts.**\n\nWe even have one of the largest whales on Steemit flagging comments that dare mention a non-existent \"competitor\" or anyone saying anything that, in their mind, is considered \"divisive\" to the community. A flag from this person will all but hide a comment from anyone's view without seeking it out at the bottom of the page. \n\nhttps://s15.postimg.org/820q6kvkr/safe_space.jpg\n\n# [In Muh Safe Space](https://youtu.be/sXQkXXBqj_U)\n\n\nSo much for being a place to discuss anything openly. And yet, people here complain about Facebook and Reddit, yet I can mention Facebook all day on Reddit, and vice versa, and never have to worry that my comment will be hidden by a single individual. Even worse, Facebook and Reddit are some of the most censored platforms in existence.\n\n### Put that in your **[hash pipe](https://youtu.be/_9BGLtqqkVI)** and smoke it!\n\nSome here are taking it upon themselves to create a safe space for everyone else, because apparently the competition from these non-existent platforms is so strong we must hide their non-existent features very mention from the fragile masses. Back in my day, there was a saying ... \"competition is good\", but apparently that's no longer the case.\n\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/cal6wr4tt/manstuff.jpg\n\n# [Smells Like Teen Spirit](https://youtu.be/hTWKbfoikeg)\n\nHere on Steemit, it's hard to find anyone that appreciates sports, guns, hunting, cars or anything that my generation considers to be laced with testosterone. Sure I find computer/programming talk interesting, but it's rare these days to find people online that can talk the 4 basic man groups as well. I've found a few, but for the most part they are hiding within the Steemit caves of obscurity.\n\nSteemit advertises that \"original content\" is rewarded, yet anyone that can speak in great detail on any of those 4 basic man groups will rarely, if ever, be rewarded for doing so. There are a few of these well written articles on these topics here on Steemit, but you will be hard pressed to find one earning more than $5. Why Is that? \n\n### I'll tell you why ... because Steemit, for the most part, is lacking testosterone. \n# (\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b\n<br>\n\nhttps://s13.postimg.org/oou4yaqp3/Grinds_my_gears1.jpg\n\n# [What Grinds My Gears](https://youtu.be/Q685Ko2DHDs)\n\nYou know what really grinds my gears? Steemit. **Steemit really grinds my gears.** Why? Because I'm too old for this shit! And for that reason, **this will be my last post on Steemit**. I will be relinquishing my posting key access for this account and leave it to the younger generation of Tuck Fheman's, so they can post happy thoughts about all things Steemit and be rewarded untold fortunes for doing so. I am just holding them back.\n\nI did my best to be a part of this generations next big thing, but generation Steemit is just too namby-pamby for this old codger. \n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/9mkkeg19t/giphy.gif\n</div>\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/bcrfwvml9/mic_drop.gif\n</div>\n\n<br/>",

contemplative mood over the last few days. &nbsp;The main reason for this that I am due to have surgery on my left eye this Thursday (1st September) - sorry for constantly bringing it up and being such a wimp. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The surgery is routine and is in some ways self-inflicted - it is due to a complication with having had laser eye surgery last year to correct my vision. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Had I not had that done I wouldn't be in this position (although) I don't regret it. &nbsp;No procedure is without risk and since this is a second procedure the risk is increased. &nbsp;It is even greater because I am also a type I diabetic (on insulin) which slows healing down and makes complications more likely.</p>\n<p>My eyesight is very important to me particularly due to my artistic hobbies like photography. &nbsp;Luckily my right eye is absolutely fine at the moment.</p>\n<p>Anyway the natural anxiety over this has lead me to be quite introspective and think about life in general. &nbsp;I have been thinking back to some of the the things I have learned and how they might have helped me had I known them when I was younger.</p>\n<p>They are in no particular order. &nbsp;I make no apologies for some of them being quite obvious or even the sort of cheesy advice you would read on a greeting card.</p>\n<p>So here they are in no particular order:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Money and your career are important but not that important</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Serbian-Dinar-and-another-Currency-000082274485_Smalla1ad2.jpg\" width=\"839\" height=\"571\"/></p>\n<p>When I was younger I was (like many kids) convinced that having lots of money would bring happiness. &nbsp;Having the latest Nike Air Jordans and most fashionable clothes, gadgets and the like was a matter of not only pride but vane necessity.</p>\n<p>It was only later that I started to realise that whilst money is a necessity for paying bills and the like it is only a tool. &nbsp;Above a certain level of comfort having more money doesn't really equate to being happier. &nbsp;It just equates to being able to have more \"things\" i.e. possessions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Depending on how you get the money it can also lead to a poverty of the more valuable commodity which is time. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>By similar extension whilst your career should be important it should not be the most important thing in your life. &nbsp;No matter what you do you aren't going to be able to buy yourself more time so don't waste it needlessly going after more money or a better position at work. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is a kind of Faustian pact where you get the worse end of the deal. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Time is the truly important commodity and sharing it with others is one of the most valuable uses of it.</h3>\n<h1><br></h1>\n<h1>Following the herd (or shoal) doesn't doesn't pay off</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_16631433_SMALLec951.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>We are all programmed by society and culture to follow what is \"normal\" and ordinary. &nbsp;This is especially true during those early teen years. &nbsp;Even though we pretend to rebel by picking subcultures like goth, emo, metalhead or whatever this is just a thinly veiled surface level of individuality. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>At it's base it is as conformist as anything else and is merely designed to massage our egos whilst still allowing us to be cocooned within the comfort of our own selected \"tribe\".</p>\n<h3>Truly great people, the kind that change the world don't follow herds or tribes or anything else. &nbsp;They set their own destiny and forge their own path. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>They make the world follow them.</p>\n<p>I know what kind of person I would rather be and it isn't one of the sheep.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Follow your own dreams not those of others</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_76511897_SMALL42a71.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>This is related to the idea of ignoring \"herd mentality\". &nbsp;We often have dreams and expectations placed upon us by our family, friends and teachers. &nbsp;I remember once telling one of my teachers that I wanted to be an artist or a film director and being told:</p>\n<h3>\"You are much too clever to waste your life on something like that. &nbsp;You should be a doctor or a lawyer.\"</h3>\n<p>It may seem like a complement but these kind of sentiments can be just as damaging as more obviously disparaging ones because they psychologically close down certain options in our lives. &nbsp;One can be made to feel that doing what we want would be letting our family, friends and educators down so we push those things aside and just do what is expected of us.</p>\n<p>This ultimately leads to dissatisfaction with our work and our lives. &nbsp;It is much harder to change this in your thirties or later and much easier in practical terms to do it when you are in your teen years and choosing your career. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Paradoxically it seems harder in your teens to say no to the psychological pressure even though it is ultimately your choice.</p>\n<h3>Self confidence in your own ability to know what you truly want early one pays off in the long term. &nbsp;Don't live your life for other people.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>People who agree with you all the time aren't helping you</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Better_an_open_enemy_false_friendb2a45.png\" width=\"794\" height=\"403\"/></p>\n<p>We naturally like to associate with people who have similar views to us and seem agreeable to us. &nbsp;This is part of human nature. &nbsp;Unfortunately what many of us don't realise when we are younger is that a good friend needs to be honest with us. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Someone who is always a \"Yes-man\" can actually encourage us to stagnate and reinforce our negative behaviours. &nbsp;It is simply not healthy and it is dishonest. &nbsp;Your best friends are those who tell you the truth and call you out on your bullshit. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly in your work and acedemic life it is important to listen to conflicting opinions. &nbsp;Just reading material that agrees with what you already think prevents you from evolving both from a personal and an intellectual standpoint. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We can see this in modern internet culture where people focus purely on material that agrees with their political or societal opinions. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Ultimately it leads to greater division, polarisation and entrenchment of attitudes.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>There is no shame in changing your opinion</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/chinese-proverb-on-windmilla2b73.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"560\"/></p>\n<p>To some degree people who have very strong opinions may be respected. &nbsp;It is seen as a sign of confidence. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It could also be a sign of inflexibility and inability to change. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I believe now that life is all about change and evolution. &nbsp;If you stop moving you get left behind. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I was younger I would stubbornly hold on to opinions and beliefs as a matter of pride. &nbsp;There was a certain amount of machismo behind sticking to your opinions and not conceding to those of others. &nbsp;To change them would be seen as some sort of humiliation.</p>\n<p>This is a complete fallacy of course. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>To stick to an opinion merely for the sake of not changing is not only foolish it is positively pathological. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Ultimately it means that you do not progress as a person. &nbsp;I now realise there is no shame in changing your position and admitting that you were wrong. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In many ways it is a lot braver because you are sure to get flack from others who are unable to do the same for \"flip-flopping\".</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Cherish your friends and family because you don't know how long you have with them</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Happy-multigeneration-family-walking-in-the-countryside-000073792689_Small8784a.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>I found this out the hard way in my early twenties. &nbsp;A friend of mine (let's call him John) who I had been with throughout Junior school went to a different college from me. &nbsp;This was in a different area of the country. &nbsp;Though we often made plans to get together they would often follow through for logistical reasons.</p>\n<h3>Over time our conversations and meetings became less and less frequent as \"life\" started to get in the way. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>A few years later when I was home from University and I hadn't heard from him in a while I bumped into a mutual friend.</p>\n<p>Nothing in my life had prepared me for what I heard next. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A year earlier John had been involved in a minor road accident whilst riding his motorbike. &nbsp;He had fallen off as a result and had received what seemed at the time like a minor knock to his head. &nbsp;Feeling fine he had decided that he didn't need to go to hospital. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for him, that minor knock on his head had ruptured a small artery in his meninges, resulting in a slow but progressive increase in intracranial pressure. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>A few hours later he literally dropped dead. &nbsp;He was only 21.</h3>\n<p>I felt so much guilt. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This friend had been so close, like a brother to me. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He had died so suddenly and I hadn't even known. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I had so many regrets - maybe if we had gotten together before his death it could somehow have changed things just enough to prevent this from happening? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I kept having such thoughts and I still have them from time to time.</p>\n<h3>I don't think I have every truly gotten over the trauma of this.</h3>\n<p>You assume that the people you care about and love will always be there just because you can't imagine life without them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fact is life is fragile. &nbsp;Nobody knows how long they have to live.</p>\n<p>Life and death happen all around us all the time. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Appreciate and spend time with loved ones whilst you can because you never know when that time will be up, either for you or for them.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Your parents and grandparents were young too</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Photo-album---photos-of-children-000070298559_Small3feff.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>One of my teachers at school used to say that -</p>\n<h3>\"When you are young you know everything except your own ignorance.\"&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;This is so true. &nbsp;Once we become teenagers we tend to assume we know better than everyone else. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When our parents and grandparents give us valuable advice we tend to ignore it because - what do they know? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We tend to forget that they were once young and had the same kind of hopes and dreams we do. &nbsp;By being further on in their lives and having more experience they can give us a perspective that we lack.</p>\n<p>They are a resource that we ignore at our peril.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Never give up on your hobbies and interests</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/painting-brush53238.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"530\"/></p>\n<p>We all know the saying that \"variety is the spice of life\". &nbsp;We all tend to get pushed for time as we get older and develop more responsibilities. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is very easy to give up on those simple hobbies that gave us so much pleasure when we were younger. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether it was engaging in a particular sport, listening to music, enjoying nature or just travelling we tend to give less importance and priority to these activities.</p>\n<p>These kind of activities are very important for recharging our mental energy and helping us to get away from the worries and concerns of life. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>One could almost consider them to be like a from of activity based meditation.</p>\n<p>I gave up on my art work for many years due to the sheer workload I had during University and then in work. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was a mistake and it was only through being forced to re-enage with it through ill health that I realised how important and fulfilling a part of my life it was and now still is.</p>\n<h1><br></h1>\n<h1>My Final Point: Life is short make sure you actually experience it</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_89191645_SMALL0da25.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>As you get older you start to realise how quickly time passes by. &nbsp;We have a tendency to live in either the past or the future, rarely experiencing the present. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not only does this make time appear to pass more quickly but it also leaves us unable to appreciate what we have at the time only realising it later through the lens of hindsight. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the principles of mindfulness is the idea of recapturing and experiencing the moment. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think we would all do well to follow this idea. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>By reconnecting with our momentary existence we can become more aware of our own thoughts, feelings and what we ultimately want. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>It can also allow us to readjust our focus on what is important and start to concentrate on it more whilst we still have time. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>So many of us simply drift through our lives without the kind of focus this could provide and you don't want to be the person who starts making these kind of observations when it is too late for you to be doing anything with them.</p>\n<h3>You don't want to end up feeling like you were just a passive bystander or a passenger in your own life.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_57565926_SMALLac7bb.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Thanks very much for reading. &nbsp;I hope you found it useful and interesting.</p>\n<h3>Do you have any similar things that you wished you had known when you were younger? Please share in the comments below.</h3>\n<p>This will probably be my last post for a while as I am due to have eye surgery tomorrow and will be recuperating for some days. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If I have time I might put out another post before the operation but if I don't please all take care and I wish you all the best.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>You can find more of my work by following me @thecryptofiend - thanks.</em></p>\n</html>",

Apparently, we did. The obvious--to most of us--is getting, well, too obvious. &nbsp;Some self-declared scientific types had to review some pictures and all agree (mostly, 76 of 77) that nothing of the sort is happening right in front of us.</p>\n<p>Really now?</p>\n<p>First, the published articles that I recently saw in the news referencing the <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084011/pdf\">published paper</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/science/scientists-just-say-no-to-chemtrails-conspiracy-theory.html?partner=msft_msn&amp;_r=3\">The New York Times:&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Scientists-Just-Say-No-to-1.jpg\" width=\"841\" height=\"902\"/></p>\n<p>Now <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160812103718.htm\">Science Daily:</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chemtrails-not-real-say-atmospheric-science-experts-ScienceDaily-2016-08-24-21-53-51.jpg\" width=\"776\" height=\"989\"/></p>\n<p>A quick excerpt to get us started:</p>\n<p><em>The authors of this study, including Carnegie's Ken Caldeira, conducted a survey of the world's leading atmospheric scientists, who categorically rejected the existence of a secret spraying program. The team's findings, published by Environmental Research Letters, are based on a survey of two groups of experts: atmospheric chemists who specialize in condensation trails and geochemists working on atmospheric deposition of dust and pollution.</em></p>\n<p><em>The survey results show that 76 of the 77 participating scientists said they had not encountered evidence of a secret spraying program, and agree that the alleged evidence cited by the individuals who believe that atmospheric spraying is occurring could be explained through other factors, such as typical airplane contrail formation and poor data sampling.</em></p>\n<p><em>The research team undertook their study in response to the large number of people who claim to believe in a secret spraying program. In a 2011 international survey, nearly 17 percent of respondents said they believed the existence of a secret large-scale atmospheric spraying program to be true or partly true. And in recent years a number of websites have arisen claiming to show evidence of widespread secret chemical spraying, which they say is linked to negative impacts on human health and the environment.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u2026</em></p>\n<p><em>\"The experts we surveyed resoundingly rejected </em><em><strong>contrail photographs</strong></em><em> </em>(emphasis mine)<em> and test results as evidence of a large-scale atmospheric conspiracy.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>---------------------</em></p>\n<p>Did you get that? \"Photographs\", that\u2019s (almost) all they looked at, studied or examined; that\u2019s it! Just some static pictures. In my \u201cscientific research\u201d I went a step further. How could I not? My job, my reputation, my incumbent responsibility to my employer and nightly audience was at stake. Instead of examining photographs, which I already had thousands of, I bought four cameras, two computers, and some time lapse software so that I could watch the entire day\u2019s weather happenings in under five minutes. These cameras would begin recording the sky, snapping a picture every five-seconds from sunup and finish at dark, day after day after day. Pictures were not good enough for me. I needed video just to see if there was something that I was missing!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I would get home from doing the 10pm news, change my clothes, and go upstairs to begin rendering the four movies. I had one camera covering each of the cardinal directions and then watch each one.&nbsp;It is truly amazing what we don't see when we watch clouds without the aid of compressing time by 150 times or 300 times. At these speeds, it all makes sense. To be able to see all different layers of the atmosphere working together, or against each other, a fog that seems like and even feels calm, but is actually violently whipping around, even clouds&nbsp;retaining their shapes and sizes as they pass through each other, WTF!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/Yi4YFzyeEZ0</p>\n<p>What is quickly understood is that the wind does not carry the clouds, the water molecule is riding upon another force, another current, apart from the wind. This was a revelation to me and once realized by the wider atmospheric sciences community will utterly revolutionize the science. I lost count of the times I would see a cloud layer moving EXACTLY 90 or 180 degrees opposed to the layer immediately above or below. This is impossible in a natural setting.&nbsp;Now reflect on how many chemtrails you seen in the shape of a perfect \"T\" or \"X\". Think of alignments...&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An excerpt of me discussing when I started recording the sky with time lapse.</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/LXsPhe9zWoA?t=8m18s</p>\n<p>I began this operation in January of 2005, just slightly more than six months after having my <a href=\"https://steemit.com/geo-engineering/@scott.stevens/wouldn-t-it-or-would-it-be-great-if-we-could-control-the-weather\">\u201cAh-ha\u201d moment</a>; in which I came to understand that all the planet\u2019s weather was profoundly impacted by man-made technology. Still, I had questions of where did all these planes, trails, and conspiracy fit into this complex story? It wasn\u2019t until I was four months into this project that I finally got my answer. Only then did I understand that these planes were tracing out geometric patterns while isolating perturbations, distortions, or gaps in already existing trails. It was freaking \u201cBrilliant!\u201d, was my exclamation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These revealed perturbations ARE the reason for the chemtrails!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/sunset_arrowed.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"358\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_0012.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\"/></p>\n<p>Watch an example in this narrated video of the planes unique flight patterns recorded by during those early days of my research.</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/WVhbdhT9xoY</p>\n<p>How else would the weather makers know where to target, how much energy to target and the results of their work, without these straight chalk lines in the sky to gauge their effectiveness? If you\u2019re going to pulse the atmosphere with \u201csomething\u201d you\u2019ve then got to go figure out if you got it right! Was the \"input\" enough, or not enough? Was the intended impact sufficient to achieve the desired result, Yes-or-No?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Straight lines across a moving fluid would allow for the direct observation of the atmospheric intervention and yet still appear to be just contrails to the masses below. It is an utterly elegant program that now with forty years under its belt has remained in the dark recesses of atmospheric sciences. A science that is so obsessed with the illusory CO2 issue that there is no intellectual capacity or energy available to see what\u2019s happening right of front of their faces.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/EL-831-Marion-1976.bmp\" width=\"850\" height=\"526\"/></p>\n<p><strong>A train yard, &nbsp;1976 - Engine EL 831 Marion, Ohio &nbsp;-- Chemtrails already in the sky</strong></p>\n<p>Again, a very well played hand guys. Aircraft, in plain sight, some trails, but not too many, usually\u2026 Then get the program to use commercial aircraft (the most economical solution available versus military transport types) to do the work so it blends in with everything else up there, and then share the wealth that results from the program. The Military Industrial Complex makes a mint with all the planes, satellites, computers and esoteric technology perfected upon deployment. Those in the \u201cknow\u201d get to play in the energy, food &amp; agricultural, insurance, re-insurance and commodities futures markets making billion upon billions of dollars with foreknowledge of what is to come weather and climate wise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>War, weather warfare is a racket and the population is told that we are experiencing \u201cclimate change\u201d when&nbsp;really it is \u201ceco-terrorism\u201d as Former Defense Secretary William Cohen termed these activities back in 1996, some twenty years ago!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_S._Cohen\">The full quote:</a><em> \"...some scientists in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific so that they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races; and others are designing some sort of engineering, some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops. Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.</em></p>\n<p><em>So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations. It's real, and that's the reason why we have to intensify our efforts, and that's why this is so important.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cohen3.gif\" width=\"165\" height=\"169\"/></p>\n<p>Another point to consider: With GLOBAL geoengineering now four decades active what is the true trend-line of the planet\u2019s surface temperature? I contend that this number has been totally lost and smeared by these activities. No one outside of those involved specifically with these activities knows the true state of Planet Earth\u2019s climate. It has been hijacked.. for some reason that is apparently worthy of this massive, expensive and covert operation.</p>\n<p>What we need is an Edward Snowden to emerge from the geoengineering programs to come forward and share the truth with humanity so we can make intelligent, informed and sane decisions about what to do to prepare for the coming decades. Is it an Ice Age as the <a href=\"https://astronomynow.com/2015/07/17/diminishing-solar-activity-may-bring-new-ice-age-by-2030/\">Sun is screaming</a> or is it a middling along like the past 20 years with little change in the surface temperatures or a resumption of the warming like we experienced during the first half of the 20th Century?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Which is it?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/article-2055191-0e974b4300000578-216_468x4731.jpg\" width=\"468\" height=\"473\"/></p>\n<p>We deserve to know, sooner than later.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gisp-last-10000-new.png\" width=\"829\" height=\"493\"/></p>\n<p>This global weather and climate engineering program WILL END. My question becomes, \"What happens then?\" &nbsp;This issue is the most important one facing all of us today. Not tomorrow or next year, but today.</p>\n<p>Keep looking up,</p>\n<p>@scott.stevens</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trail-finger.jpg\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "Trading Steem is not hard. In that part steem(it) development team has done a great job. Compared to the establishment Steem is a huge step in the right direction of fairness and openness.\n# How the JS index works\nJS measures the net result of the buyers and sellers actions.\nEveryone buying Steem (or anything else) in any financial instruments market does it to profit. Interesting distinction is however if those buyers or seller do expect their profits short term or long term.\n\n## How short term Steem \u201cspeculators\u201d act?\nThey buy steem and expect return in a matter of days, weeks, months.\n## How long term Steem \u201cinvestors\u201d act?\nThey buy steem and expect return in a matter of years. They buy steem, and in this particular high devaluation environment that Steem is quickly power up .\n\nMeasuring the net result from the Steem \u201cspeculators\u201d and  Steem \u201cinvestors\u201d buying, compared to Steem owners selling can give us the ultimate tool to measure the future price movement of Steem (in  the short to medium term).\n\n# And it turns out to be incredible easy\nAll of the described above is nothing more than the \u2026 increase/decrease of the total Steem held by exchanges! (with a few caveats I will keep  proprietary for now)\n\n# How this matters\u2026 give me a practice example.\nOK here it is.\nSteem hit a local low of 0.001224 btc/steem on 08/29 4:30 UTC. Since then the price is generally higher. Should you buy (out of FOMO) or wait for the price to come down to even lower levels sometime in the near future.\nIf JS index has fallen down since  08/29 (as it has indeed) this means that all the buying (price increase) was by short time speculators. So, if no news justifie their buying exuberance, you can expect soon those speculative buyers to give up/cash out of their short term position and the price to continue following the long term trend of the JS index itself.\n\n# Initial JS index\nThe index is set at __1000.000__ as for 2016-07-26 12:56:12 UTC\n\n# Current  JS index\nAs of 2016-08-31 03:03 (UTC) the value is: __553.650__\n#\n[EDIT]\nBelow is a chart of JS Index and Steem price for July 27th to Aug 30th NB some days have more than one data point.\n#\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Ukazg7G.png)\n#\n#steemit #trading #finance #steem #money",

If you'd like to participate in the beta, simply send an email to steemapp@gmail.com and which device (iOS or Android) so we can send you a beta invite.  We're utilizing hockeyapp.net (microsoft) to manage the beta. \n\n### Some important things about the beta:\n- *Use at your own risk - **period**.*  \n- Don't login with an account that has your life savings in STEEM. Why? Because this is a beta product!\n- Don't login with your password if you don't feel comfortable - you can still use the app without logging in. Key import options will be available in a future version.\n- Images you upload from your mobile device are publicly available to the world. \n- Image hosting providers could change during the beta and your images could be wiped out permanently without notice\n- We receive crash reports, analytics and other useful debugging information from HockeyApp\n- Once signed up, you will receive notifications to download all future versions of the beta\n- Are there known issues? Yup! Expect frequent beta versions with no announcement.\n- Hockey provides features to send us feedback directly. There's a 100% chance we'll get your feedback if you submit through hockey app or email us steemapp@gmail.com.\n\n# How You Can Help\nWe are developing at a feverishly-fast pace...as fast as two guys can who have day jobs and families to support.  If we could, we'd say adios to the day job and focus 100% on Steemy (that's a dream I have weekly).   That being said, the reality is that we are building this with our own time, energy and spare funds.   That makes us no less passionate or driven, but imposes real-world constraints on development.\n\nYou can help us by:\n1) Participating in the beta\n2) Giving us constructive feedback on crashes, design, and other app-specifics\n3) Of course, financial - any funds we receive via upvoting go directly to supporting our monthly server costs, red bull addiction, etc...\n\n# How to sign up for the beta\n- Email us at steemapp@gmail.com and tell us which device (iOS or Android) you want an invite for\n- Or, if you don't care who sees your email address, post a comment below and specify iOS or Android (or both)\n\n# What is Steemy?\n\n[Learn more about Steemy Here](https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemapp/introducing-steemy-fully-native-ios-android-apps-for-steem)",

    "body": "<html>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Continuing on from the previous tutorial style I though it would be useful to cover how an image evolves from the original RAW file to final finished and corrected file.</p>\n<h1>TLDR: The Finished Image VS the Original Side by Side</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Arif_Akhtar_Gabby_EOAI_01_final_desaturate_crop1of1copy_small35b3a.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"525\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Arif_Akhtar_Gabby_EOAI_01_original1of1copy_small65a05.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"525\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Final image is on the left and the original image is on the right. &nbsp;You can also see a large version of the final image at the bottom of the post.</p>\n<p>The original image is already pretty good and only needs very minor corrections for blemishes, colour balance etc. - using the right kind of lighting and lenses helps with this - as well as the model having good skin and makeup. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The equipment used was my Nikon D800 camera with Nikon 85mm/1.8 lens shooting wide open.</p>\n<p>The model here is Gabriella Kennedy. She was backlit using the window behind her and a reflector held in front for front lighting and highlights in the eyes.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Basic Skin Retouching in LR and Photoshop</h1>\n<p>I have used the spot removal tool in Lightroom to remove some minor blemishes which leaves me with the image below. &nbsp;I have described use of this in more detail in my <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@thecryptofiend/quick-portrait-retouching-in-lightroom-tutorial\">previous tutorial</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.05.02c2a5b.png\" width=\"403\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>Basic skin retouching to remove blemishes in Photoshop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.05.13d51a2.png\" width=\"604\" height=\"494\"/></p>\n<p>Larger version to show this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.05.31730aa.png\" width=\"415\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>The difference is subtle but I don't want to go too far and remove too much skin detail. &nbsp;I'm just using the spot healing brush tool as detailed in <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@thecryptofiend/how-to-fix-damaged-photos-in-photoshop-tutorial-with-example-image\">my previous photo repair tutorial</a>. &nbsp;This photo is already pretty blemish free so doesn't need anything more advanced.</p>\n<h1>Temperature Adjustment</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.05.4780851.png\" width=\"627\" height=\"510\"/></p>\n<p>Detail to show the difference. &nbsp;The colour seems off. &nbsp;So I'm going to do a colour balance adjustment here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3017.34.34ee0e5.png\" width=\"658\" height=\"592\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.06.448f1bc.png\" width=\"402\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This is an improvement but it's not perfect. &nbsp;I might do more fine adjustment in Lightroom. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Background Fix</h1>\n<p>I also want to remove the window bar behind her. &nbsp;So on new layer (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N). &nbsp;I use the clone stamp tool to copy the background to the right over to bar. &nbsp;The clone stamp tool looks exactly like a stamp and is just below the healing brush. &nbsp;It directly clones an area without any intelligent modifications.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.06.580da7b.png\" width=\"404\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>So the bar is now gone.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Eye Veins</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.07.2447c66.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"582\"/></p>\n<p>OK I might do some very subtle work on the eye veins. &nbsp;Again I will create a new layer (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N) and zoom in and carefully use the healing brush to erase the veins.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.09.1331e69.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"412\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.12.32785f6.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"591\"/></p>\n<p>This is to show the difference to one of the eyes. &nbsp;This is a bit too much so I will enlarge the image and reduce the opacity of this layer to 50%.</p>\n<p>Here is the full size image. &nbsp;This looks about right.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.26.1667b29.png\" width=\"402\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Final Adjustments in Lightroom</h1>\n<p>I'll save this and open it up in Lightroom for final adjustments. Just before saving I couldn't resist doing another colour balance change but it is really unnecessary as I will fix the colours in Lightroom.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.40.26ef4e2.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3017.44.2804107.png\" width=\"249\" height=\"598\"/></p>\n<p>I have basically adjusted the exposure very slightly to +0.10 -</p>\n<p>I have also tried auto temperature which gave a more balanced result but the colours didn't look right to me. &nbsp;It set the Blue/Yellow slider to +13, so as a compromise I set it half way to +6 which looked better to my eye.</p>\n<p>I also reduced the saturation by -11 as it seemed a bit strong to me. &nbsp;The image is essentially finished apart from cropping.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Final Image With and Without Cropping</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Arif_Akhtar_Gabby_EOAI_01_final_desaturate1of1a10fd.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1199\"/></p>\n<p>Uncropped</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Arif_Akhtar_Gabby_EOAI_01_final_desaturate_crop1of16fa86.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1199\"/></p>\n<p>Cropped. &nbsp;The difference is very subtle but I think the crop emphasises the eyes and face more.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>THE END</h1>\n<p>I hope you found this useful. &nbsp;I've tried to keep it short and to the point.</p>\n<p><em>You can see more of my work @thecryptofiend - hope you enjoy.</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>(Verification for me here: </em><a href=\"http://www.aapicture.com/about-me\"><em>http://www.aapicture.com/about-me</em></a><em>)</em></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "North Korea is a perfect example on what happens to a society when strong censorship is implemented. The BigBrother censorship, the type of censorship that dictates what you are supposed to think and feel about jewish people, black people, asian people, white people, men, women, porn, Islam, what to eat and what not to eat, vaccines, history, words, music, libraries, Barbara Streisand, Terrorism, Murder, Abortion, Adoption, Foster-Care, Right & Wrong Education - the list is endless - and Now Youtube is implementing it as well, so it is time to plan the goodbye-party.\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/ERDcCe5.png</center>\n\nFinding a good alternative for youtube has been talked about among youtube-creators since it was bought by Google and completely changed into whatever you want to call it today, so I was happy to be introduced to the LBRY community a while back, they had this idea that video-hosting would be a good idea but failed at their initial business-plan which was Pay Per View, as we all should know by now - Pay Per View is a really hard market to conquer, and to be completely honest - I was against the model, because I don\u00b4t believe in PPV as something there is a demand for, so I went and told them my mind in their slack-group and left to focus on something else.\n\nSo when I just now heard that LBRY is actually going to develop a user-controlled de-centralized Youtube, of course I jumped in my chair because I believe there is a HUGE demand for a youtube without censorship. A youtube that is not controlled by studio-interests and Dictated what to show and not to show in the traffic-machine that suggest videos for users.\n\nIn the world today, documentary-makers who dedicate their life and integrity to producing non-political factual documentaries about topics such as the true Origin of the Jewish people vs the true Origin of todays Jewish people or how many of them actually was killed vs how many that has been documented to be killed during world war 2 are flagged as anti-Semites, right wing, nazis or racist - Same thing if a non political dedicated factual documentary creator makes a video about topics like: \"9/11 was an inside job\" - automatically flagged as a conspiracy theorist with a thin-foil-hat and forever sentenced to the weird side of youtube next to 300 other videos that suggest that 9/11 was not an inside job and that in fact everything the government say is true and beautiful - censorship.\n\n<h3>Big Brother hates mathematics, he absolutely hates it!</h3>\n\nIt has gone way too far now, what you can say and not say - what is allowed and what is not allowed to ask questions about. And let\u00b4s face it - Big Brother hates mathematics, if he could - he would ban it in schools worldwide and make sure nobody could add up or subtract because it is not in his interest that we - the people - learn.\n\nAnd obviously we are not alone wanting to be able to publish content without the fear of being censored by powerful authorities who give delegations to a hoard of censorship-bureaucrats  world wide who sit and flag all kinds of content their special interest does not agree with and make sure that the people walk in line the way they want people to walk in line.\n\n<h1>If you actually really saw a UFO, had your friend take a picture of it with you and the alien next to it - do you think anyone would see it? or believe it?</h1>\n\nOne of the basic censorships they do is to laugh and label everyone who has seen anything that can question the power to be - for example a stronger power that maybe dwell not so far away from us.\n\nJust think about it - You and your friends walk down the road, and you meet a big alien with a space-ship that use complex technology that does not exist here on earth - he tells you that he is able to cause all kinds of cool effects on the earth with his knowledge and technology - and since he is in a good mood he shows you a few examples of how advanced his civilisation is, and also tells you that they are many more then those who live on earth. Imagine if this really happen to you  and your friends - you even documented it on two cameras and even sound-recorded the whole event, gave the alien a hug - waved goodbye - high-fived your friends and started uploading content to facebook, youtube, instagram, soundcloud and in excitement started blogging about it - would anyone really believe you?\n\n<h1>All we want to do is to talk about what we are not allowed to talk about, because that is where the skeletons in the closet are hidden.</h1>\n\nSo, after the <a href=\"http://observer.com/2016/09/youtube-phillyd-eric-schiffer/\"> recent youtube controversy about the new censorship-rules</a>  a lot of people are sad and depressed, because Youtube has reduced so many of us into clowns with no circus already, so when  <a href=\"https://lbry.io/press/500k-fundraising-round-pillar-vc.md\">LBRY Announced $500K Raised to Build the First Community-Controlled YouTube Alternative</a> I feel very optimistic again about the future, maybe the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth - once again can flourish on this earth and the institutions of liars shamefully sent home packing as the old world truly is soaking in the blood of corruption, the new world which we are creating as communities should always embrace free speech and freedom of information and protect those rights. Free speech and freedom of information is not a ticket to become an asshole or a full time troll which in every case of course is the other side of the debate. \n\nBig Brother Censorship must end - and the way to end it is by Little Brother(s) start telling the whole world every single thing they know about Big Brother, expose all those politicians who have ripped off the people and supported special interests and replace them with people who have not been and will not allow themselves to be corrupted by greed or fear. \n\nAs we all know, good men have died for the rights to free speech, others has died for bringing true stories out in public about knowledge that is forbidden by anyone to know anything about.\n\nWe as human beings and technocrats are the ones who can change the world, and we must change the world - there are too many numbers in too many affairs that does not add up, we know that their game is rigged and it is time for revolution. \n\nThe one right most people do know they have, is the right to remain silent - everything they say can and will be used against you in the court of law. That is the sad majority of the world now unfortunately. The silent partners.\n\nI love you all - Freedom Fighters, Keyboard Warriors - Truthers!! Don\u00b4t give up just yet!\n\n---\n<center><a href=\"http://steemspeak.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gzDNmHq.png\"></a></center>\n---",

    "body": "![jumpingpeoplesteemitanarchyfaba6.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/jumpingpeoplesteemitanarchyfaba6.jpg)\n\nFor many of us, Steemit has already changed so much - the way we navigate the web, the way we think about money, and for a fortunate committed few, it's even changed their professions. However, the change that I expect from this model goes even deeper. It's possible that Steemit, and descendent technologies, may play a part in creating a voluntary world, a stateless world, in which everyone who takes money from someone, or puts someone in a cage without their consent, or orders such acts, will be seen and treated as a criminal. There are several ways in which Steemit can aid this cause. Let's start with the most important - the conversation.\n\n# It changes the way we talk\n![argument288ba5.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/argument288ba5.jpg)\n## The problem with voluntaryist argumentation\nMany of you might have noticed, and even been a party to, hard-line conversations about anarchy, in which the voluntaryist proceeds to take the words of the other party, and question them about some perceived inconsistency in their beliefs, attempting to lead them through a Socratic dialogue, in order to bring them to accept the truth - that the other party is wrong - very, very wrong. You also might have noticed (as I eventually noticed, after years of banging my head on walls) that this technique almost never works.\n\nOf course, the reason that it doesn't work, is because people have a need to feel that they're being understood, that their concerns are heard, that their thoughts are valid. In brief, they need to feel like people. If you don't treat someone like a person - unless you're talking to an exceptionally patient person - you're unlikely to receive a personable response.\n## An oasis\nThe comment section on YouTube is a running joke. Facebook discussions descend into dirtslinging, strawmen and threats. You may wade through many racist and sexist comments before you find something that is truly valuable information, and even then it may be tainted with aggression. In contrast, Steemit's comments sections seem like a desert oasis - all but filled with calm discussion, respect, insight, or at the very least, positivity. Surely, this is a place where one can have a constructive conversation about controversial topics.\n## The incentive to be good\nI have noticed over these few short months, the way that Steemit has changed the way that I interact with people, especially online - on Steemit and other social networks. I've found myself a few times, even as I'm about to make a statement which is mildly passive-aggressive, thinking \"Hold on - is this something I would write if my reputation were on the line? If not, maybe I shouldn't write it.\" Even when I'm going to give someone some piercing criticism, which, if presented in the wrong way, may seem a condemnation, I can find ways to demonstrate empathy, such as compliments or other niceties.\n\nIt may sound like an unfortunate description of humanity (or of myself) to say it, but when our bank balances and reputations are on the line in every moment, we can find ways to communicate more kindly, and therefore, more fluidly, with the people we interact with.\n## Commitment and consistency\nIn Cialdini's famous and excellent book, [Influence: The psychology of persuasion](http://amzn.to/2c5z38T) he describes how, when people make a commitment to something, they are more likely to see it as part of their identity, and strive to live up to that identity.\n\nWhen people are kind to each other, respectful, and even open-minded on Steemit, it's not just that they're pretending to be nice. By acting nicer, they become nicer. By acting more open-minded, they become more open-minded.\n## The quality of our ideas\nIf the ideas of voluntaryism are as good as we believe they are, then surely a place like Steemit, where people are strongly encouraged to be respectful, considerate, empathetic and even open-minded, would be an ideal place to discuss them. If it turns out that our ideas are not as good as we think they are, then it gives us the perfect medium to discover something even better. That is beautiful.\n# Tax-free and shameless\n![breakchains10ab9.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/breakchains10ab9.png)\nIn many developed countries, taxes are generally seen as legitimate and necessary, and people claim to be proud of paying their taxes - sometimes because they truly believe it, and sometimes because they don't want to face the fact that they have been forced into an elaborate con, from which they have no apparent escape.\u007f\n\nBut what if they did have an escape? What if, instead of being paid as an employee, having their income taxes automatically deducted from their pay, they were paid directly. What if thousands or millions of people were making income, or making a living, this way, and decided to openly flout the tax authority, publicly, knowing that it wouldn't have the resources to pursue any more than a small fraction of the cases?\n\nObviously, that would damage the appearance of legitimacy of the state, and also the perception of omniscience and omnipotence that its proponents tend to ascribe to it.\n# Development of cryptoanarchic solutions\n>\"Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word 'anarchy', in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It\u2019s a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.\"\n> - Wei Dai\n\nWe all know that Steemit/Steem is much more accessible than virtually any other cryptocurrency, being based around a style of platform which more than one billion people are already familiar with. That's pretty cool, and that means that more money will flow into cryptocurrency, meaning more attention, and thus even more development for similar technologies.\n\nMore development in cryptocurrency means more methods to control money, and other forms of information, publicly, privately, or anonymously, without governments being able to do anything about it.\n# Conclusion\nSteemit is an important step, a continuation of the snowball effect of cryptocurrency, leading us to a voluntary, cryptoanarchic future, full of wonders we have not yet imagined, and degrees of freedom as yet unforeseeable. Boldly we take our pens, pads, keyboards and wallets, building a highway to a world where concepts are our language and our tools, but never our weapons, where the purity of ideas is worth fighting for, but never worth fighting with.\n\n---\n\n# About me\n\n[![kurt robinson in the mountains of puebla](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/26/pictureofmecroppedbdb8d.md.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/gsqzK)\n\nMy name is Kurt Robinson.

Professional knowledge, in particular technical know-how, is a key asset for such organizations as their success depends to a large extent on their ability to create, manage and transfer knowledge efficiently. Let us call this process <strong>knowledge valorisation.</strong> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I review below some of the key enablers of knowledge valorisation&nbsp;by sketching a sort of road map.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Step 1</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;The first step shown below&nbsp;might look trivial, but I believe that most organizations (in particular those which are in the process of restructuring, M&amp;A, etc)&nbsp;might find it worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/ueoc9n77j/road.png\" width=\"959\" height=\"545\"/></p>\n<p>In other words,&nbsp;the first challenge is to make sure that knowledge is properly tracked and stored, especially if the organization is very large.&nbsp; If knowledge turns out to be mostly in <strong>implicit</strong> form, the organization runs a significant risk to lose knowledge and performance as a result of staff turnover, as when the key people leave or retire, nobody may be able to run some critical processes. In addition, as implicit knowledge is difficult to share, if explicit knowledge on key processes is not available, it is difficult for new recruits to become quickly operational. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>If a large body of documents spanning the organizational knowledge landscape is available in electronic format, it is appropriate to set up and use a formal knowledge classification scheme. The most powerful approach to knowledge classification, following the principles of semantics, is based on two components: &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Taxonomies</strong>, i.e. multi-level, tree-like classification frameworks. An example of a comprehensive, well-known taxonomy is Linnaeus\u2019 classification scheme for nature as divided into three kingdoms: mineral, vegetable and animal. Linnaeus used five levels: class, order, genus, species, and variety.&nbsp;Advanced knowledge management might call for the definition of multiple taxonomies, as shown in the example below. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Classification rules</strong>, i.e. a set of criteria to place each document in one (or more) positions in the taxonomy. Rules are typically based on specific properties of the document. Simple classification rules are based on keywords and other metadata, e.g. if a document has \u201cJava\u201d as a keyword, it is likely to be classified under a \u201ccomputer science\u201d branch of a technological taxonomy. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above elements, taken as a whole constitute an <strong>ontology</strong>, i.e. a detailed, potentially exhaustive description of a knowledge domain in terms of a collection of data records, together with their metadata/attributes, organized and classified in one or more taxonomy-based \u201ccatalogues\u201d. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/jbvf5lv93/semantics.png\" width=\"1006\" height=\"522\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The pictures above refer to&nbsp;an ontology which is relevant to a public research organization which regards technology transfer as part of its mission.&nbsp;Such organizations feel strong pressure by their funding bodies to demonstrate the positive socio-economic impact of public research on society through concrete examples. In order to meet such demands, they must define and implement a proactive and cost-effective Knowledge &amp; Technology Transfer (KTT) strategy. Then it is essential that all the knowledge assets in the organization are identified (technologies, general know-how, training capabilities) and as many KTT channels (licensing of intellectual property, joint R&amp;D with industry, training, people mobility \u2026) as possible are enabled. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>At this point, a classification engine is used:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/fk988pp6j/classify.png\" width=\"971\" height=\"558\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The ultimate deliverable is a context-sensitive, searchable knowledge catalogue&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/w8zb4dy35/catalogue.png\" width=\"1065\" height=\"616\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Informal Summary</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>All the tools described above aim at avoiding that in a large organization people reinvent the wheel all the time, just out of lack of knowledge of what their colleagues are working/have worked on. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, using the wheel analogy: if you are into technology transfer, such tools will help&nbsp;you show your \"wheel\" outside your organization and identify whoever could use it to make an innovative car!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note that some older comments to this post refer to (very different) content which has now been removed. Please disregard them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "Revamping Curation Is The Way To Increase Steem Power Demand\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been living under a rock, for the past month or so, it has been quite clear that the price of Steem has been rapidly falling. Although before the run up to $4 was most likely in a bubble and the system is in no danger of failing, as it has worked at this price before, I still believe there is a long term solution that needs to be found to fix this problem. Ned made a post yesterday talking about ideas he had, which mostly, in my opinion focused on lowering the supply entering the market, but this is only a symptom of the problem. My solution although a bit drastic addresses the problem which is a lack of incentive to purchase Steem and power up. \n\nhttp://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/sites/chicagoartistsresource.org/files/curator_1.jpg\n\nTo begin, what are the incentives now? Well the main incentive is having weight while voting, as well as getting a daily return on the Steem Power you have in the system. These might seem like adequate incentives in theory, but in practice I think we are seeing something very different. The problem right now is even with the daily interest we are getting on our Steem Power, we have still been losing money due to the price drops. The interest, which is supposed to act like inflation protection, is actually doing nothing because as long as the price is falling, people are not going to want to move their Steem dollars or Steem into Steem Power. We need to give a greater incentive to hold and purchase Steem Power that will benefit us as a community in the long run. Sure we can wait for the price to fall and have people cash out and make it cheaper to enter the system, but this still doesn\u2019t address the underlying problem.\n\nSo what is my solution? I strongly believe we need to move the payout split to 50:50 between authors and curators from the current 75:25 it is at. I know this will be controversial, especially because many authors today, INCLUDING MYSELF, are making essentially a living off the site, but ultimately it comes down to what is best for the community. We need to look at who is adding more value to the site, the authors or the curators. Depending on who you ask their answer might be different, but in my opinion both are equally as important. One cannot survive without the other and the payouts should reflect that.\n\nhttps://steemit.com/images/steemit-share.png\n\nCurating is supposed to be a heavy incentive for people to enter the system, but the earnings from it are subpar at best. For example, I have 20,000 Steem Power and my average earnings per day is around 6 Steem Power. That means my daily return on investment is .03% a day and only around 11% a year and that is with a pretty profitable curating strategy. Sure it will technically come out to a bit higher than 11% due to compounding but it still won\u2019t make that much of a difference. A huge selling point to me was that if you choose to curate rather than create content you will also be able to earn a sufficient amount, but no one is going to put 20,000 Steem into Steem Power that they would have to wait 2 years to pull out if the reward of waiting is not sufficient enough. Selling Steemit as a platform where the users who upvote the content are equally as valuable as the users who create the content makes users actually want to buy Steem and convert it into Steem Power. \n\nWe should not focus on slowing down the supply that enters the market, but rather retaining and creating new users that will become active daily. Once people have upvotes that actually mean something we will see people flock to the system. Rather than just browsing reddit and upvoting, with no return, they would have a much better experience here. The majority of the people on the site are not authors but lurkers or readers and we need to cater specifically to that crowd because they will end up as the masses, should more come. Authors deserve to be paid for their work but the percentage of money that goes to payouts is a lot. \n\n\nhttp://www.firebellymarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/building-community-Firebelly-570x467.jpg\n\nLike I stated before, I have been very successful and Steemit which is why I want to cut down my rewards, because if we continue in the direction we are currently going, it will become a race to the bottom , at which point everyone will leave. I strongly believe that splitting the curation rewards and author rewards equally can benefit the demand for Steem power in the long run and cause a higher amount of user retention within the system. \n\n-Calaber24p",

The guy who [picks apart arcane C++ code for fun?](https://steemit.com/steem-help/@biophil/the-ultimate-guide-to-voting-power-with-cartoons-formulas-and-code-references) The nerdy dude who [starts arguments with anarchists](https://steemit.com/anarchism/@biophil/an-original-parable-about-voluntaryism) and is [trying to buy a kayak?](https://steemit.com/marketplace/@biophil/want-to-buy-your-kayak-surfboard-paddleboard) What's all this about waffles?\"\n\n<center>\n![](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmNNpUTSL2R9Pmy4gs9n1wq7Cj8zH5MuHDBZpGu8zVZHwK)</center>\n\nWhy yes, I am. I am all those things, and **I am also an amateur waffle chef.** And today, I am going to share with you a little piece of heaven. People, I present to you **Philip's Spectacularly Light, Fluffy, and Crispy (despite being 100% whole grain) Sourdough Waffles.**\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 8 oz sourdough starter (don't have sourdough starter? maybe I have a solution for you! read on!)\n* 1 cup whole wheat flour\n* 1 cup old fashioned rolled oats\n* 1 cup water\n* 3 eggs\n* 3 tbsp oil (soybean, canola, refined olive, coconut oil, butter - whatever)\n* 1/4 cup milk\n* 1/4 cup plain yogurt\n* 1 tsp baking soda\n* 1/4 tsp salt\n* Flax seeds for decoration and tastiness\n\n## The Night Before, we make the sponge\n\nThis recipe results in such incredible goodness that you have to plan ahead just a little bit. The night before (or about 8 hours in advance), put the **sourdough starter,** the **whole wheat flour,** the **oats,** and the **water** in a big bowl and mix them well so there are no dry spots. Make sure your bowl has lots of extra room, because this will about double in size overnight! It should look like this:\n\n<center>\n![](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmU4GbcD3PJH2SEzaSQ4Kprznb9K3tV7cfTgdjxiN4bUkP)</center>\n\nOvernight, the magic little critters in the starter will eat and eat and eat and make carbon dioxide, and by morning, your stuff will look like a sponge:\n\n<center>\n![](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmPU7GNPTKQNDFiMFcxLXJSuemssexGRaLZ896fmyW8UTX)</center>\n\nNote: **If you don't have sourdough starter,** you don't have to start the night before. I have not tested this, but here's what I'd try: instead of the starter, mix a cup of flour with a half cup of water, and add a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. Then mix everything else in and carry on with the recipe. Your batter won't ferment, so there's no need to let it sit overnight, but the baking soda will still react with the vinegar and you'll get (hopefully) fluffy waffles.\n\n## On the Magical Morning, we mix the batter\n\nNow that we have our sponge, we'll start mixing stuff in. You can add all the rest of the ingredients now, **except the baking soda.** It won't ruin it to add the baking soda now, but you'll be a little better off if you wait. So: add the **eggs, oil, milk, yogurt, and salt:**\n\n<center>\n![](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmST4kHHhrK1rz42SPzVVZWJmtdE3DKK62nDQWcGRJSerY)</center>\n\nAnd mix it all up real good (I do this by hand, but you'll probably be fine if you use a stand mixer or power mixer or some such gadget):\n\n<center>\n![](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmP7ufxmALnDXENuE1Tv29mCGS9dd4VBTZRJdX1EBXqdb5)</center>\n\nNow that your ingredients are mixed up, get your waffle iron all ready to go. You don't have to turn it on yet, but make sure you're ready to. Get your oil all ready to brush or spray on to the iron, and open your container of flax seeds (or whatever nuts you like) so you're ready to sprinkle them on.\n\nNow, add the **baking soda.** Sprinkle it on and mix it in quickly and thoroughly. Within a few seconds, the baking soda will react with the acid from the sourdough, and your batter will start to fizz:\n\n<center>\n![](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmRhQwoTcDpvQXMV5FoDk2MSxcgdanNfUexn7P2PuvdBiw)</center>\n\nTurn your waffle iron on, and grease it. I like to use **virgin coconut oil** for this; I melt a blob of it into the center of the iron and then use a brush to spread it all around (top and bottom):\n\n<center>\n![](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmdUaKUbewvgxAFoWUHCtCL9bQr335ivQf96RXY2Dr2miv)</center>\n\nPour some batter into the iron (make sure to scoop from the bottom of your batter bowl, because the oats tend to sink); my iron takes just a bit less than 1 cup of batter. Make sure it spreads all around, then sprinkle your flax seeds (or whatever nuts you like, or nothing) on the top of the batter, close the iron, flip it (if it's that kind of iron), and wait. You want to go from empty iron to closed iron pretty quickly.\n\n<center>\n![](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/Qmbe1Nxo6V1tnXie7G5mtKqRT1WdxpGFodbRCCL3VK6kT9)</center>\n\nDepending on your iron and your altitude and your exact mix of batter, your cooking time will vary. **I cook my waffles for about 4 minutes.** You should try variations of this and see what you like. When it's done, open it up, and voila:\n\n<center>\n![](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/01/IMG_20160828_17155353683127.jpg)</center>\n\nTransfer it to a cooling rack, and enjoy!\n\n## Tips on enjoying\n\n* Butter and maple syrup\n* Sliced strawberries\n* Peanut butter\n* Cashew butter (this is one of my favorites)\n* Put leftover waffles in the fridge, and warm them up in the toaster!",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>We were all impatiently waiting, but the day is finally upon us and it is with pleasure that we announce the official kick off to the first Steemit Book Club.</p>\n<p>http://i68.tinypic.com/wb9soy.jpg</p>\n<p>Taking into consideration personal requests from some of you, we came to the conclusion that next <strong>Monday, September 12th at 6 p.m. PST/9 p.m. EST/2 a.m. GMT/11 a.m. (Tuesday) UTC</strong> would be the ideal time to finally launch this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For those who may have missed <a href=\"https://steemit.com/books/@neilstrauss/the-steemit-book-club-plan-v1-0\">the preliminary plan,</a> maybe it would be a good idea to let you know that one of the perks of this steemit based Book Club is the possibility it allows for book lovers to earn rewards all while reading a beautiful masterpiece in good company.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, all Steem Dollars generated from the weekly posts of the Book Club will be divided equally among book club members after finishing each book.</p>\n<p>All you have to do is to attend 75 percent of the calls or chats, remain in the book club until the completion of the book, and, obviously, read the whole thing. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yes, our \u201culterior motive\u201d is to use this to motivate everyone to complete these epic tomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first book we\u2019re going to launch with - as many of you know already - is James Joyce\u2019s masterpiece: <em>Ulysses</em>. This particular book choice if you may recall, came as an almost unanimous decision in <a href=\"https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@neilstrauss/introducing-neil-strauss-and-a-steemit-book-club \">this post</a>.</p>\n<p>This was a book that was so controversial that when it first was released, this happened:</p>\n<p>http://i63.tinypic.com/23h7eb7.png</p>\n<p>According to Modern Library, <em>Ulysses</em> currently ranks first on the 100 best novels of all time. So what better way to launch a Book Club than by starting at the top \u2013 especially with a book so many people want to read, yet few are able to penetrate.</p>\n<p>http://i65.tinypic.com/4gn0gy.png</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Here are the final details:</p>\n<p><strong>What</strong>: The Steemit Book Club (SBC)</p>\n<p><strong>When</strong>: Every Monday at 6 p.m. PST/9 p.m. EST/2 a.m. GMT/11 a.m. (Tuesday) UTC</p>\n<p><strong>Where</strong>: Our first session will be held via Freeconference. You can join via internet by clicking the link below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hello.freeconference.com/conf/call/6291831\">https://hello.freeconference.com/conf/call/6291831</a></p>\n<p>Or you can join by phone by calling one of these toll free numbers (800) &nbsp;719-6100 or (218) 339-7800 if you are calling from within the United &nbsp;States. The participant access code is 629-1831#.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re calling from outside the U.S., click on the same link, then &nbsp;click \u201cjoin conference\u201d and choose the option \u201cCall by Phone.\u201d In the &nbsp;\u201cDial-In Numbers\u201d tab, you will see a long list of additional toll-free &nbsp;numbers from around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Where Else</strong>: Some book clubbers will also be in steemit.chat on our channel #steemit-book-club during the calls, so feel free to write comments and enter discussions there instead\u2014or in addition.</p>\n<p><strong>How</strong>: Just call in. Or go now to steemit.chat and register in #steemit-book-club to receive a private message containing this information on how to join the conference. These details will also be posted on a pinned post on the channel for everybody to see.</p>\n<p><strong>How much</strong>: There\u2019s no reading assignment for the first call. Just show up and we\u2019ll do the first reading aloud together. Though if you\u2019re feeling feisty, read Joyce\u2019s Portrait of the Artist as an Old Man first.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Which</strong>: Preferably order the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ulysses-original-James-Joyce-ebook/dp/B017WQ5WTI/\">Gabler edition of <em>Ulysses</em></a>, which has line numbers in the margins so we can all communicate clearly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to buy the Gabler edition or can\u2019t find it in your country, grab an earlier edition of <em>Ulysses</em> for free <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/ulysses04300gut/ulyss12.txt\">via Project Gutenberg </a>or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ulysses-James-Joyce-ebook/dp/B002RKT6QK#nav-subnav\">Kindle</a> or in your <a href=\"http://manybooks.net/titles/joycejametext03ulyss12.html\">favorite format</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy</strong>: Fortunately, Freeconference grants us the option to host a club meeting using only audio. That means there\u2019s no need to reveal your identity at all, especially if you use the web link option to join the call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: If you are having any trouble joining the call, post a message in #steemit-book-club and we will get right on it.</p>\n<p><strong>Absences</strong>: Don\u2019t worry if you miss a session. We\u2019ll post weekly summaries along with the reading assignments for the following week, and, if everyone is comfortable with it, recordings of each call.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the discussion will be open all week long in our steemit.chat channel (#steemit-book-club), which is now accessible to everybody. And judging by the brain-picking aspect of <em>Ulysses</em>, my guess is there will be a lot to talk about in the chat room.</p>\n<p>http://i66.tinypic.com/30vgdv9.jpg</p>\n<p>This is going to be a fun adventure, and we hope that you will join us in making this initiative a success and in expanding all of our minds.</p>\n<p>Until Monday, we remain\u2026</p>\n<p>Your Book Club Co-Captains,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@neilstrauss\"><strong>@Neilstrauss</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@the-alien\"><strong>@the-alien</strong></a></p>\n<p>P.S: If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let us know in the comments section below. And of course, the next book will be chosen by those who survive this first book.</p>\n<p>P.P.S. Please welcome the members of my Inner Circle mailing list. They are just about all new to Steemit and I\u2019m sure some will become active members of the community. Make them feel at home!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<center>https://i.imgflip.com/p1ij6.jpg<br/>**CENSORSHIP**</center>\n\nLanguage is a very powerful tool because it shapes the way we think. The words we choose to use [impact how we think, feel, and reason about the world around us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity). Today I would like to address the word *censorship* because it is a very hot topic on steemit.\n\nThe first problem we always face is different and ambiguous definitions for censorship.  Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t always practical to *define* our terms in every debate and therefore drama queens toss the term \u201ccensorship\u201d around far too easily. I would go so far as to say that the censorship card is played about as often and illegitimately as the race card.  Often those who play the *race card* are more *racist and oppressive* than those they slander, the same principle applies to those who play the censorship card.\n\n## Censorship requires Aggression \n\nThe defining characteristic of a free society is the absence of initiation of violence. This includes the credible threat of violence, fraud, theft, etc.   Without the threat of aggression people can freely say whatever they want, whenever they want without fear that their person or property will be harmed. A critical distinction of a free society is that you cannot express yourself in ways that violate the property rights of others.\n\n## Graffiti is Aggression and violation of Property Rights\n \nGraffiti is defined as writing or drawings scribbled, scratched, or **sprayed illicitly on a wall or other surface in a public place**. In a free society the Graffiti artist would be tracked down and expected to pay restitution to the property owner.  No rational individual would argue that the artist has been censored by the property owner or that the property owner is the one initiating aggression against the artist.\n\n## Property Owner defines Art vs Graffiti \nThere are places where graffiti-style art is acceptable and is actually encouraged. In this case no aggression has occurred and therefore the action is legitimate. \n\n<center> https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7485/15754046208_7d666a75a9_o.jpg</center>\n\n## Spam, Porn, Harassment, and Fraudulent posts are Digital Graffiti  \n\nWhen it comes to websites like Facebook, YouTube, Google, Reddit, and Steemit we have digital property owned by individuals providing a free and voluntary service to society. It is not possible for these organizations to censor user content because they are not using violence, theft, etc. \n\nThe only true censorship is when government agents approach these companies and demand content be removed under threat of force or violence.  Provided these companies are not under any kind of threat, there can be no censorship.\n\nWhen someone [demands that YouTube share ad revenue](/steemit/@calaber24p/censorship-on-youtube-creates-an-unique-opportunity-for-decentralized-platforms-like-steemit-to-create-an-alternative-video) they are taking the role of the Graffiti artist that demands property owners not repaint over their artwork.\n\nSome people may consider the [Graffiti artwork worth thousands of dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy), but this doesn\u2019t change the moral character of the vandalism.  Likewise, some people may feel their humor, sarcasm, teasing, crude language, or vulgar posts to be artwork and demand that other users see it and/or up vote it for payment. \n\n## Graffiti Hurts Community Value \n\nWe all love the idea that Free Speech adds value to the speaker, but our selfish desires to be heard come at the expense of the listeners.  Few people desire to move into a neighborhood where there is unfettered graffiti and complete disrespect for property rights.  Likewise, few people want to join an online community where there are no standards of mutual respect.\n\n## A Perception Problem \n\nWe have a very real problem in society today.  The problem is that people feel *entitled* to things that are not theirs.  Whether it is health care, google ranking, reputation, or [right for gay couples to be served by particular vendors who oppose gay marriage](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jul/08/tony-perkins/wedding-vendors-have-been-forced-participate-same-/).  These entitlements can only be delivered by initiating force and violence against innocent people.\n\nIf a particular vendor (YouTube, Facebook, Google, or your Local Florist) will not serve you, then you must take your business elsewhere.  Vendors who lose a significant amount of business will voluntarily reconsider their policies.   \n\n## But they have a monopoly!  \n\nTo the extent that a business gains the vast majority of the market share without relying on government regulations to shield them from competition, the monopoly is deserved and was earned by providing a quality product that others were unable to compete with.\n\nThere are no laws forcing everyone to use Google, YouTube, Reddit, or Facebook. There are no regulations preventing competitors from starting up and competing.  Complaining about their unwillingness to serve you is like a local mall refusing to allow certain tenants.  It will certainly make business more challenging for those tenants, but the prospective tenants are not entitled to a prime high-traffic spot in the mall.\n\n## Flagging Posts based upon Differing Opinions \n\nSome people have been complaining about users who down-vote posts they disagree with. The basis of the idea is that all posts are *entitled to* funding from those who support the ideas.  This stance is in direct opposition to the vested interests of every stakeholder.  \n\n\n<center>http://godfatherpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/thomas-jefferson.png</center>  \n\nWhat should happen when one stakeholder wishes to fund a cause abhorrent to another stakeholder of equal size?  The two opinions are canceled out and the remaining stakeholders get to decide.\n\n## Incentive to be Tolerant and Inclusive \n\nAll users, particularly whales, have financial incentive to be tolerant and inclusive.  This grows the overall network effect and makes everyone the most money possible.  To the extent any community adopts a culture of intolerance that overly restricts the range of acceptable opinion it will push people away.  New communities will form to serve the needs of those who are rejected and the free market competition for mindshare will continue.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf Steem remains a libertarian / anarchist enclave then it will fail to attract a broader audience and that in turn will mean that ordinary people will not get involved with cryptocurrency.  Likewise, if Steemit fails to curtail abusive, threatening, and toxic individuals it will also drive away the broader audience leaving only those with skin thick enough to take the abuse of trolls.  \n\nI want Steem be a healthy, vibrant community with engaging discussions from people with all points of view. Unfortunately (and fortunately?), I am only one of many users who have a say in what kind of content gets voted on.  Each and every one of us contributes to the culture and we will all succeed or fail based upon how we act.\n\nLets stop throwing the term \u201ccensorship\u201d around here on Steemit unless it is explicitly referring to the threat of violence.  It is out of place and conjures up inappropriate negative reactions similar to playing the race card.  Instead, lets focus on the rights of all voters to express their opinion for or against any post.  If you disagree with how someone is voting, then focus your argument on how something adds or removes value to the community rather than whether someone is committing the \u201cvile\u201d sin of non-censorship by utilizing their legitimate voting rights.\n\nSteemit is a free and voluntary platform built on the basis of free association; censorship is impossible in such an environment even if the community or steemit.com chooses to minimize the visibility of some content or block it all together.  \n\nThe blockchain is open, your content is logged and recorded for all time.  Anyone who wants to see your content or offer a competing service to steemit.com is free to curate and display what they like.  \n\n## P.S. On Definitions \n\nWe live in a world where common words are generally used in ways that are in direct contradiction of their meaning.  The unfortunate reality dramatically lowers the quality of public discourse because it allows people to talk past each other.  Activists leverage the emotional response to the word censorship to provoke people into violating the property rights of others.  It may well be that censorship is taking on a broader meaning that would also encompass the no coerced behavior of Google, Facebook, etc.   The problem with the broader meaning is that the word censorship is no longer useful for accurately defining moral/immoral behavior.  Under the broader definition, accusing someone of censorship is as meaningless as accusing them of filtering spam emails.  How dare they censor spam artists!",

It\u2019s a fascinating thing really. This is one of the biggest mind-boggling mysteries that seem to defy even time itself, mysteries that are impossible to explain from a purely rational point of view.\n\nAsk any person in the world \u2013 scratch that \u2013 ask any person in the history of the world to describe politics in one word and you are guaranteed to hear some of the following words: Deceiving, dishonest, incompetent, cheating\u2026Etc. And probably, this is from the generous side.\n\nNow,  ask any of those people how come they trusted those individuals to manage their finances, and it would seem like you\u2019re speaking Chinese to them.\n\n## And that area right there is where the real game is being played.\n\nThat\u2019s the space where critical thinking dulls, where the emperor sells clothes, and no one\u2019s looking at Pinocchio\u2019s nose. How on earth would a known dishonest, power hungry person convince the others that he should be the one that makes the decisions on behalf of everybody?\n\nWorse than that, they give them all the power, no accountability and a virtual 100% probability to screw them , and everybody just keeps pretending to be surprised when these things happens.\n\n# Why Does This Keep Happening to Me?\n\nYou change the country, you change the century but the song remains the same, and the mystery survives. The only way to keep convincing people to accept a deal that acts against their own self-interest is to create a story that makes the exploitation of mankind look like the solution to their problem. \n\n![Alt text](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/lostpedia/images/b/b2/Lastsupper.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100117063640)\n\nYou look around, you find countries like Bolivia or Venezuela (just to give a few examples) that are extraordinarily blessed at the very same time with a rich abundance in natural resources  and a starving population despite the fact that these two things should be mutually exclusive by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nYou can\u2019t be that incompetent if you tried.\n\nBut then again, this isn\u2019t about incompetence. Their solutions were already predetermined in the narrative, and when it doesn't work and the tale falls on its own weight, they\u2019ll just repeat the same process again, because the narrative remains the same.\n\nThey keep seizing more lands, more factories and they keep \u201ccracking down\u201d on competition and seize everything in the name of \u2018the common good\u2019. Then they bankrupt them as well and they seize more and bankrupt those too. \n\n### If it wasn\u2019t so heartbreaking it would be hilarious.\n\nHere\u2019s the crazy part of all this is that  this wide spread phenomenon is completely irrelevant to the economic system, the economic policy, or to the continent, and it's happening across the board. \n\n![Alt Text](http://redlikeme.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bank-robbery-digital-art-hd-wallpaper-1920x1080-2127.jpg)\n\nFind me a person in southern Europe that has good things to say about politicians in the ECB.\n\nAll the solutions they present are hell bent on screwing the little guy, whether it\u2019s draconian austerity measures, raising the retirement age, bank bail outs\u2026Etc\n\nI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s due to incompetence, dishonesty, or both. I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s irrelevant, because the solution is already pre-set beforehand to achieve one purpose, and one purpose only, that power keeps consolidating itself. \n\nThat might explain why we always keep hearing sentences like this one: *\u201cThe game is rigged\u201d*, which happens to be one of the most popular expressions of our generation.\n\nLet me give you another example.\n\nWhen you turn on the radio and there are some finance experts on, how many times we hear the following words: \n\n*They\u2019re making things worse; They\u2019re repeating the same mistakes again;  Things are actually getting worse and not better; The solutions are creating more problems than solving; How come the recovery is worse than the recession?*\n\nYou see where this is going? \n\nAnd this is not exclusive to our generation, in fact this story form is a very common archetypal myth that exists across every society and period of human history.  With the very same the result, that whatever action that will be taken it will only serve to reinforce the dominant narrative.\n\n# Once Upon a Time\n\nIt is believed that the cavemen were the first storytellers, and whoever controlled the dominant story had a strong pull on the rest of society.\n\n![Alt Text](http://www.kino.de/wp-content/gallery/homo-erectus-2007/homo-erectus-einfach-pr-hysterisch-11-rcm0x1920u.jpg)\n\nThe  human story is at the heart of everything, it\u2019s the prima material of how most people perceive reality, the moment you question someone else\u2019s dominant narrative, the debate is over before it\u2019s even started. For many people, they much rather fall for the same thing again and again and until the end of times, rather than to dare questioning the story they grew up around.\n\n> ### *\u201cIt\u2019s easier to fool people, than show them that they have been fooled\u201d.*\u2014 Mark Twain\n\nThe crazy part however, is that the even if those individuals were to fully realized how they've been fooled, they would probably still willingly walk towards the fire nonetheless. Metaphorically speaking.\n\n### Unless of course, there is a new story that replaces the old story.\n\nI remember reading one of James Altucher\u2019s amazing posts and had a wake up call. I hope I\u2019m not butchering the story, but it basically it goes like this: A friend of James asked him to go with her to the bank to help her decide the best option for her to put her money. Since he has some solid expertise in the finance world, it seemed like a wise decision for her part.\n\nDuring that meeting in the bank, James just sat down, said nothing and only listened, when they finally left the bank he started explaining to her all the ways that they were trying to take advantage of her and rip her off.\n\n*\u201cHow can they do that to me?\u201d*\n\nThe next day, she went to the bank and did everything they asked her nonetheless.\n\n![Alt text](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/maggiemcgrath/files/2015/06/0211_hipster-piggy-bank-401k_1024x576.jpg)\n\n# This is How the Story Goes\n\nCommon folklore has it that there are those people among us that regular people  that look just like me and you, but when they get a magical paper that says that they work for the status quo, then an invisible laser descends from the sky and grants them all sorts supernatural abilities and financial savoir-faire.\n\nWell, sort of... Everything they touch still goes to crap, but that doesn\u2019t matter anymore and their never-ceasing incompetence doesn\u2019t seem to bother anyone either. Because now, they're part of the narrative.\n\n### And apparently, narrative trumps logic. \n\nA successful investor once told me: *Never listen to government economists, if they knew how to manage money, they would\u2019ve made money themselves instead of telling people what to do.*\n\n![Alt Text](https://ascendingstarseed.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/cc12b-preppers2b-2bdoomsday.jpg)\n\nAs the Altucher story goes, along with countless others, whenever there is a threat to the narrative, the debate is over before it has even started. For many people in the world, defying authority is just about the last thing they would do, and that includes killing themselves and their own children.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to the subject of the day. We tell ourselves a story that defies every single law of the universe, that the idea of good business is spending trillions of Dollars bombing millions of people and generating the biggest debtor nation the world has ever seen.\n\nIf that is not telling you anything then honestly, I don\u2019t know what does.\n\nWe tell ourselves even crazier stories, that if we just grabbed enough productive citizens and stacked them into jail cells for victim-less crimes, or for carrying bits of vegetation in their pockets, then we're going to revitalize the economy, and that oh! We will rehabilitate those poor souls through brutality and sexual violence.\n\n### Again, narrative trumps logic in ways logic can't even perceive.\n\nSome people choose to deny their programming, and that seems as the right choice because sooner or later those stories could start acting as their very own gatekeepers. I\u2019m not talking about inner resistance, I\u2019m saying that maybe we need a new story that replaces the old story.\n\n![Alt Text](http://i0.wp.com/dailyzen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/How-to-Make-Good-choices-and-make-the-most-of-them.jpg)\n\nThere has never been a better time for financial independence than the times we live in, there has never been so many options available for someone to start their own company, find jobs, or make their own movies even\u2026 All of that without dealing with a large number of resistant gate-keepers who may or may not have been programmed to serve a certain narrative.\n\nI don't know about you but personally, if I had to follow a narrative, I much rather have one that I designed for myself rather than one that I was born into.\n\n# Closing thoughts\n\nThey say that when there is a paradigm shift, there is usually a new story that renders the other story irrelevant, but until then and even though the tools are already available to the public, people will not make the final move until they start seeing a certain degree of mass-adoption around them.\n\nIt is that mass adoption aspect that would make it acceptable for their psyche to separate from that old, probably coercive narrative that has been attached to them.\n\n![Alt Text](http://www.elfm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/storytelling-night.jpg)\n\nA few minutes ago, I was just going to end this piece with a question: \u201cDoes the Blockchain need a story?\u201d\n\nBut then I realized that steemit has both the crypto-currency and the story aspect. So I\u2019m swapping that question for a few modest words:\n\nCan we just work together to build something beautiful? Do you guys see what we have here? Why don\u2019t we just focus on what we have and how we can improve it. After all, it\u2019s much harder to create something really great when you\u2019re being held back by unnecessary drama. Wouldn't you agree?\n\n And not to forget:\n\n### Your dream needs you full steem.\n \nSources: [1](http://www.geliosoft.com/100-happy-dollars-3d/) - [2](http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lost_Supper) - [3](http://redlikeme.ca/tpp-is-all-about-banking-powers-which-will-remain-secret-for-5-years-after-signing/) - [4](http://www.kino.de/film/homo-erectus-2007/) - [5](http://money.cnn.com/pf/millennials-and-their-money/) - [6](https://ascendingstarseed.wordpress.com/category/economy-and-global-collapse/) - [7](http://dailyzen.co.uk/2015/03/19/how-to-make-good-choices-and-make-the-most-of-them/) - [8](https://storify.com/ProfKarim/the-power-of-storytelling)\n\n## [*Follow the Alien*](https://steemit.com/@the-alien)",

    "body": "<center>https://stakepool.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/photo3.jpg</center>\n\nSo, I was sitting in my $5000 massage chair smoking a cuban cigar when all of a sudden all kinds of bells started ringing. So I had to stop what I was doing and walk all the way over to my enormous trading-desk on the opposite side of my man-cave to see what was going on, and of course - there it was... A new post from my ex-boyfriend who cannot believe I dumped him for a better looking guy, and I knew he was out for blood so I started reading:\n\n<h3>A littlebit of history first</h3>\n\nWhen I wrote against @stellabelle and her article about synero-amp vs steemit, @tuck-fheman started spamming my comment section with all kinds of accusations, and lately he has started what he calls a \"comic-strip\" about me where he is doing his very best to harass the hell out of me.\n\n<h5>I still stand by what I wrote in my article against @stellabelle - it was a very dumb move on her behalf and I have people on record who confess to buying synereo-amp and losing money because of her article. The point of calling her out was to let her know that she has a loud voice in this community, and that she therefore must be careful advising people about investments and projects in a market she has no real clue about, because she is new.</h5>\n\nThen, when I apologized in public to @heiditravels for using explicit words when I was mad at her for not showing up to a Public Relation Interview when she came to Per\u00fa, an Interview that would have gone out on Television to 10 million Peruvians in prime-time and maybe secure 200,000 new signups for Steemit, he went on another rampage and started posting screenshots of the conversation and tried to get people to flag my post, which did not work because people are not stupid around here - they see what is going on.\n\n<h1>I still think what @heiditravels did was selfish, but I am over it - It is history @tuck-fheman - she wanted the @dollarvigilante more then me, and I have come to accept that he is much better looking then me, no homo :) (Just kidding)</h1>\n\nToday @tuck-fheman posted another harassment-cartoon, and even went to the #steemitabuse chat and bragged about it, told people that I was a sociopath that needed to be stopped, a woman-abuser and many other things that was just degrading and sad to read from him.\n\n<h2>Tuck & Stella = Early adopters who made a lot of steem posting pure shit</h2>\n\nSo what do I do? He is one with the most reputation on Steemit because he was very early into steemit and was in the original \"circle-jerk\"-club as they called it. Apparently back in those days you could post a picture of your garbage-can and make thousands of steem and now a days you have to actually make real content with real value.\n\nThen we have @stellabelle - I have nothing against her, never tried to attack her in any way - just had to speak up when she decided to embrace synereo-amp in a way that felt like... she was pooping where she was eating and I have honestly not read a single article she has published since. Instead I have found new aspiring artists like @poeticsnake who make amazing drawings and really put in a lot of real work in her art.\n\n@stellabelle also is from the very early adopters of steemit who made a lot of steem by writing articles about how she ripped of her friends when she was a car-salesman, or how she used to shoplift in stores when she was rich. Something to be proud of? Would those articles be worth anything if she wrote them today?\n\n<h1>In case you don\u00b4t know what I do on Steemit, I make comedy, entertainment, cartoons Here are a few examples for earlier:</h1>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojNbGf5oIhM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh-TKt_GSCc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijVJNn0qgxg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHzdXtFKwYA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SMMo7aQnPY\n\n\n---\n<h1>I also do Technical Analysis of Forex, Stocks and Crypto-Currency in posts like this:</h1>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyXt_kJhomU\n\n---\n\n<h1>And I also make funny songs about steemit and crypto like this:</h1>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P2FB9Mg_YI\n\nand like this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gfntBEI3Aw\n\n---\n<center>So please - Tuck-Fheman, Stellabelle - Leave me alone if you are going to act like bullies and collude and harass me - there is no point to that! <b>Start doing something positive for Steemit instead of all this negativity! </b>And to all the rest of you - I hope you see it that I loud and clear do not want to have anything to do with these two people. </center>\n---\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JhD2D0s.png\"></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DLFAEdd.png\"></center>\n\nBreaking up is never easy, I know - but you have to let me go :)",

Many people don\u2019t like competition, some people fear it, some people get motivated by it, and some people see it as an opportunity that helps them step up to the next level.\n\nPersonally, I get the same emotional reflex from new competition than I get from any change of weather, it doesn\u2019t really faze me that much.  Long time ago I\u2019ve learned to open a new folder in my brain containing all the elements that I can\u2019t control, and the emergence of new competition certainly qualifies for that folder.\n\nAnd the reason I do that is because I think that the worst thing you possibly can do is to let your fear-based reactions make your decisions for you.\n\nAlthough to be totally honest with you, I\u2019d be an idiot if I told you to completely ignore competition and act as if doesn\u2019t don\u2019t exist. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s well worth your attention because it may show you something you\u2019ve missed, it may remind of why you do what you do in the first place, and depending on the competition, it can even help you improve and advance. \n\n![Alt Text](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jCsWg5lEM9w/To2MZ4wwQMI/AAAAAAAAI8Q/VNo2kdw4ot8/s640/Matrix_067Pyxurz.jpg)\n\nA few months ago a new disruptive technology came to the world. It allowed all sorts content creators to make some income doing what they love, all while bypassing the restrictive censorship of armies of gate keepers around the world. And since you\u2019re reading this, then you\u2019re probably using it too.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, when what you do is truly amazing, you can\u2019t really expect that no one else is going to try to replicate it. In fact, the strange thing would be that if no one was ever going to attempt to create \u201cthe new steemit\u201d.\n\nAfter all, competition is a part of life, and it\u2019s almost here so maybe it\u2019s time we talked about it.\n\n# Dancing with Mr. Ying and Miss Yang\n\nOn the positive side, competition can make us stronger and more connected. All those small debates and unnecessary dramas would suddenly take a back seat to more important matters. \n\nIt can motivate us to up our game and take it to the next level. It can encourage us to keep improving so we don\u2019t get too comfortable. It can help us realize what we have, and not take it for granted. \n\n![Alt Text](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TVDMaHEL61w/U1_ZuVFcttI/AAAAAAAAMvg/dt0wlqDLFWI/s1600/living+in+the+matrix.jpg)\n\nBut there's another way  to approach competition, the Yang way, where you can go to that room where you archive all those things that you can\u2019t control, head towards the door and kick it wide open. Just sit there and let fear invade you.\n\nI know this sounds crazy, but believe it or not, the second most common thing people do in face of competition is to fear it and let them rush into making unnecessary decisions. Now, I don\u2019t know about you but to me panic doesn\u2019t precisely strike me as a solid strategy.\n\nHowever, I do understand why some people might experience some concerns. *\"Look, there\u2019s a new competition, they have a brand new website, their logo looks so professionally made, their name is so catchy. Hell, they even have shiny shoes\u2026\"* \n\nFrom that point on, it will be just a matter of time until this question starts circling around: *What if people start pouring there?*\n\nI hate to break it to you, but these things can and will probably happen.\n\nA few steemians will move there and that\u2019s ok. In fact, that\u2019s very understandable, they will have their reasons. Maybe they go on their own, or maybe they will have an offer to join. \n\nSo when that happens, there are two things that you can do:\n\nYou can worry that people are migrating elsewhere, or you can remember the \u201csecret\u201d: That they will never stop making people. \n\nPlus, if that if the goal is expansion, then it\u2019s a comfort knowing that the journey hasn\u2019t changed and that we\u2019re still on the same course.\n\n# Destination Moon\n\nThat  are enough potential users in the planet for everyone, they will never stop making people, remember? \n\nPlus, if the dream was grow and reach hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people, then nothing has really changed in the grand scheme of things. right?\n\nMaybe a few will leave and it\u2019s ok, maybe they\u2019ll come back quickly afterwards, maybe they won\u2019t or maybe this is a good opportunity to remember:\n\n## That moon we all talked about, our moon, is still the goal.\n\n![Alt Text](https://s9.postimg.io/ptqv6s6of/Untitled_design.png)\n\n*Picture dedicated to @smooth.  Thank you for the logo advice!*\n\n# A View from the Future\n\nSo in the future if you read some open letters from some prominent writers explaining why they moved away to the competition, so maybe we don't need to give these things more importance than they deserve.\n\nSometimes diversification is a smart move, sometimes people need to look for what\u2019s best for them, and sometimes they look for whatever they perceive as such. Whatever the case may be, it\u2019s still their choice and they are free to change their minds.\n\nAnd yes, we will probably read a few editorial posts about *\u201cWhy I left steemit for X\u201d* and maybe a little worry might circle your train of thought. \n\nMaybe their reasons are totally valid, or maybe they\u2019re unconsciously making up a story with which they can justify it to themselves. So all of the sudden every small problem is magnified and the grass on the other side looks greener. It happens.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s not our place to judge them.\n\nAnd yes, the preachers of doom will jump at the opportunity to parade their psychic abilities, *See? People are leaving steemit already. I told you!*, but when that happens please remember that we\u2019re talking about people who never let a good crisis go to waste. So whatever they say should probably be taken with a fine pure grain of Himalayan salt.\n\nThese are things that we can\u2019t control, here\u2019s what we can do.\n\nWe can step up, we can up our game, we can show them what this platform has already proved, we can remember why we joined and that maybe, just maybe show them that we are still fighting for that fucking moon.\n\nBecause let\u2019s not forget, steem is third behind Bitcoin and Ether.\n\n### And just as Bitcoin had so many new competing coins that were going to completely erase it from the map, we\u2019ll probably hear the same song again.\n\n![Alt Text](http://tr1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2014/11/04/27691a45-1606-4647-9093-637886cc89be/forecast-crystal-ball-prediction.jpg)\n\nThere will be many death predictions too. Bitcoin had about a hundred of them, so don't be surprised when that happens.\n\nBut what if I\u2019m wrong and the competition is very strong?\n\nWell then we learn to compete better. Competition is a part of life, and it can make you better if you know how to approach it. In fact, [I wrote about the subject in the past](https://steemit.com/life/@the-alien/blasts-from-the-past-lessons-from-running-a-bar-at-a-young-age).\n\nSo this goes for those of us who experienced the life changing abilities of this platform, and especially for those who are crazy enough to still believe in the same dream that we are at the beginning  stages of a beautiful game changer. For those who still have the same passion about disruptiveness as in the first day, here\u2019s something that we can do:\n\n# We Can Bet on Our Strengths\n\n![Alt Text](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cm8iJ91XEAIVokI.jpg)\n\nWe can focus on what steemit has achieved already and introduce it to the world. How many people have made some good income already? How many projects has steemit helped? How many it has brought in to life? How many relationships have been forged?\n\nSo maybe you\u2019re a filmmaker looking for a good story, maybe you can make a documentary about the lives that steemit has changed and its future effects on society, maybe the rest of us can help you.\n\nMaybe I should listen to my own words and lead by example. Maybe I should carve out some time and finally launch my very own book that was born out of pure steem.\n\nOr maybe we shouldn\u2019t have to do anything at all. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t have to step up our game just yet, and ignore any competition.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure.\n\nWhatever the case may be, I just want you to know that if you\u2019re here for the long run, than you should know that more competition will come, and when that happens don\u2019t listen to the alarming voices and trust your own judgement.\n\nI want you to know that it\u2019s not the end, that this is the beginning and that I hope that you\u2019re still enjoying this beautifully game changing ride and not planning to give up your seat just yet.\n\n#### Image Sources: [1](http://dailyseoblog.com/how-to-discover-your-competitions-seo-strategies/) - [2](http://pyxurz.blogspot.com.br/2011/10/matrix-page-2-of-7.html) - [3](http://humansarefree.com/2014/04/16-signs-that-you-are-slave-living-in.html)- [4](http://wallpaper.zone/carlsberg-wallpaper) - [5](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/peering-into-the-crystal-ball-it-leader-predict-major-tech-trends/) - [6](https://twitter.com/riaali4)",

    "body": "# Introduction\n\nThis post was inspired by a video I stumbled upon during a late night Youtube binge and it made me wondered if #feminism was in fact something that mostly benefit men basic instincts rather than women's best interests.\n\nMy conclusion...yes it did. As you watch this video, enjoy the irony of the situation we are in today.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeAerBwVL14\n\n# The Father of Propaganda and How He Used Feminism\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/edwardbernaysd9311.jpg\n\nI'm a student of marketing and any marketer's worth it's salt knows who Edward Bernays is. I'm bringing him forward so that people can realize that there are agents who fashion social movements...while most people think those same movements are \"organic\".\n\nWhat Wikipedia says about Edward Bernays:\n>Edward Louis James Bernays; November 22, 1891 \u2212 March 9, 1995) was an Austrian-American pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda, referred to in his obituary as \"the father of public relations\". He combined the ideas of Gustave Le Bon and Wilfred Trotter on crowd psychology with the psychoanalytical ideas of his uncle, Sigmund Freud.\n\n>He felt this manipulation was necessary in society, which he regarded as irrational and dangerous as a result of the \"herd instinct\" that Trotter had described. Adam Curtis's award-winning 2002 documentary for the BBC, The Century of the Self, pinpoints Bernays as the originator of modern public relations, and Bernays was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century by Life magazine.\n\n### Feminism Used by Edward Bernays to Sell Cigarettes - \"The Torches of Freedom\"\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/torchesoffreedom103f3.jpg\n\nHistorically, smoking was an inappropriate act for women just like it is today for most women to grow their armpits hair and leg hair. It was seen as unattractive. Dutch painters used cigarettes as a symbol of human foolishness in the 17th century and in the 19th century, cigarettes were perceived as props of \u201cfallen women\u201d and prostitutes. Back then,  even some women\u2019s groups also fought against women smoking.\n\n**So how do you reverse this mass perception? With a smart propaganda / public relation stunt of course!**\n\nThe formula was simple. In 1929, Edward Bernays paid women actress to smoke their \"torches of freedom\"during a big Easter Sunday Parade in New York. He hired his own photographers to make sure that good pictures were taken and then published around the world.\n\nFeminist Ruth Hale also called for women to join in the march saying, **\u201cWomen! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!\u201d** Once the footage was released, the campaign was being talked about everywhere, the women\u2019s walk was seen as a protest for equality and sparked discussion throughout the nation and is still known today.\n\n# Today's Feminists Are Useful Idiots\n\n**Useful Idiots:** In political jargon, useful idiot is a term for people perceived as propagandists for a cause whose goals they are not fully aware of, and who are used cynically by the leaders of the cause.\n\nHow does having a \"Slut Walk\" or an International \"Free the Nipples Day\" actually empowering for women? \n\nHow is working \"for the man\" in a stupid office for 40h+ per week and not spending time with their kids empowering for women? \n\nHow does having sex with unvetted men, expose themselves to STDs and at risk of becoming a single mother empowering for women? \n\n<center><h3> Last time I check, being a single mother is a straight ticket to poverty.</h3>\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Single-mothers_Foundry_Imaged8c35.jpg</center>\n\n# Did Feminism Make Women Less Happy in Aggregate?\n<center>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/original364e2.jpg\nAverage happiness index value for the period of 1972-2006 \nSource: Based on responses to question 157 of the General Social Surveys</center>\n\nAs [this Huffington Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marcus-buckingham/whats-happening-to-womens_b_289511.html) puts it:\n>Greater educational, political, and employment opportunities have corresponded to decreases in life happiness for women, as compared to men.\n\n### My theory\nSo what if most women doesn't like this \"feminist paradise\" we now live in today? Technically, there is no law in the book that discriminate on women. Women are in politics, work in every fields they want to, got to sleep with anyone they like and even have  abortions to not deal with the consequences of having sex. Why are they less happy than before?\n\nMaybe they've been sold on the idea that it is their career that defines their identity. Maybe they've been told their careers would make them happy. Maybe they've been told that focusing on family and being a homemaker is for losers who don't have ambitions. Maybe they've been told that they should never count on men because they are not to be trusted. Maybe it's because they actually lost something in this process of \"emancipation\"...what's actually needed to live \"The Good Life\".\n\n \n# In Conclusion\n\nAs Gavin McInnes crudely puts it in his clip:\n\n> I'm telling you man, this feminism thing is the best deal dude have ever had ever. You don't just get the milk for free...you get all the milk you want and the cow is happy. The cow think it's cool to give you milk. You don't have to buy the cow!\n\nFeminism along with the rise of the secular values created the perfect environment for people who want to live like rabbits and who's sole goal in life is pleasure seeking. It is also a sad place for a lot of people who will ultimately realize that no amount of self-indulgence actually fill the existential hole they have in their heart.",

    "body": "http://i.imgur.com/dH35tsb.jpg\n\nThe altcoin space has been as heated as ever, especially since the DAO hype and fallout and the Ethereum hard fork. Now, Monero is off to the races with news it will be a new form of payment accepted on the Deep Web. \n\nThroughout all of this excitement, I\u2019ve watched a lesser-known two-year-old altcoin which has also been on quite the tear this summer. I\u2019m talking about NAUT or Nautilus Coin. Some of you diehard crypto followers and speculators may already be familiar with it, but I can assure you that you\u2019re NAUT (hehe) familiar with what it is about to become!\n\nNAUT has already had a huge summer. It went from 5,000 satoshis in early June to over 70,000 satoshis by mid-July. Something was brewing. I dug around and talked to my most valued sources. I learned there were new plans to take NAUT out of hibernation and into the conversation on Wall Street. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9o3MEBL.png\n\nNow, just in the past few days it seems NAUT has again revved it engines. The price has almost doubled over the weekend and it\u2019s trading at ~130,000 satoshis as of this writing. All of this without any fanfare or concrete announcement. The period between the two sharp rises indicates solid accumulation took place, presumably by those in the know. I smell something big here.\n\nHere\u2019s what I know. It was created by Brian Kelly (CNBC Fast Money fame on TV) in 2014 as an attempt at creating a stable crypto-asset unlike Bitcoin\u2019s reputed volatility. When I initially dug around in July, I heard of plans to develop a parallel currency system like the WIR banc, but open source and peer to peer. Sound powerful? Well, since then it appears the homepage has been adjusted to reflect a different purpose. Something having to do with hedge funds...Oh my! (Takai voice).\n\n[PAR - Productive Asset Record System](http://par.io/index_en.html)\n\nIt states, \"PAR = Productive Asset Record System, An open investment recording system built with intelligent lending and hedge fund administration in mind.  A first of its kind, a fully transparent administration and audit platform leveraging blockchain technology.\"\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PgZ0IV4.png\n\nThe ticker countdown for the release of the white paper was 2:8:59:48 as of 3pm EST on August 29th.\n\nI also found the community Slack Team for NAUT/PAR, which is full of excitement, as you might imagine. I understand from reading through recent messages that the project has changed from its initial resurrection plans earlier this summer. With Brian Kelly involved, I\u2019m not surprised to see this plan steer towards a hedge fund related use case. In addition to being on CNBC Fast Money, Brian is also a cryptocurrency-friendly hedge fund manager. Needless to say, this all sounds very interesting and yet has barely appeared on the radar thanks to DAO/ETH/ETC/XMR shenanigans (as well, the professionals behind the project keeping their lips tight about it). \n\nFor those that want more details, they can be found here as well as a link to join the PAR Slack at http://par.io/index_en.html  (it\u2019s the \u201cjoin the discussion\u201d link). \n\nThat's all for now.",

    "body": "http://i65.tinypic.com/2djxchy.jpg\n\nToo often people believe that once they\u2019ve obtained that goal they\u2019ll be happy, for example, \u201cwhen I change jobs\u201d, \u201cif my business takes of\u201d, \u201cwhen the project is complete\u201d, \u201cafter we\u2019re married\u201d, \u201cif I lose some weight\u201d. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t work like that, happiness  isn't achieved through any accomplishment.\n\nHappiness comes from within, it is only a state of mind, a choice. People come and go, relationships change, possessions get old, fortunes are made, and fortunes are lost. Everything changes, it\u2019s meant to. Life is fluid.\n\n## Emotions Start with Thoughts\n\nhttp://i64.tinypic.com/2mw9jqt.jpg\n\nSome people have nothing yet they emit a constant joy, while others who seem to have it all and are on the brink of destroying themselves. It\u2019s obviously not about anything like material possessions, or relationships, but more so emotions.\n\nHowever, it all starts with our thoughts. Thoughts come from how we react to situations, they\u2019re the building blocks of emotions. So, what we think about a situation determines the resulting emotions. For example, two people might experience the exact same situation yet have different thoughts about it... one person experiences the emotion of anger, while the other experiences the emotion of sadness.\n\nThis is an important distinction because you can control your thoughts, and whether the focus is on the positive or negative aspects. Of course, sometimes difficult situations will occur that will give way to runaway thoughts, it\u2019s only a natural part of being human.\n\n## Happiness Step #1: Strive to Increase Positivity\n\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/10o1w7t.jpg\n\nTry to focus on the positive aspects of situations, it results in positive thoughts and therefore emotions, and helps you become \u201cmore present\u201d. If you choose to adopt the following habits you will experience an increase in positivity.\n\n**Express gratitude.** Be thankful for your past positive experiences and what you currently have, it helps release negativity. Gratitude instantly connects you to the feeling of love, and where love resides, fear and other negative emotions cannot.\n\nTry expressing 10 things you are grateful for every day, and speak them out loud if possible. Make sure it\u2019s coming from the heart and be detailed.\n\n**Meditate.** The practice of meditation expands awareness and improves the connection between mind, body and soul. It helps release negative emotions that might be holding you back, and is definitely one of the most effective ways to increase your positivity.\n\nTo mediate find a quiet and comfortable place. Sit or lie down, then close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths and start to allow yourself to relax. While breathing deeply, feel yourself letting go of whatever emotions you\u2019re holding onto, let go a little more with each breathe.\n\n**Give unconditionally to others.** Share your skills, share your advice, and help people out. Do not hesitate or doubt your value, even the smallest gestures can make a massive difference in someone\u2019s life. It will make you feel great; you\u2019ll reap the reward in increased positivity.\n\nhttp://i64.tinypic.com/mbo2di.jpg\n\n**Breathe fully.** A revealing research [study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02699930143000392) by Pierre Phillipot found that certain emotional states are associated with distinct respiration patterns. Participants were instructed to generate emotions such as sadness, fear, anger and happiness to the best of their ability, while their respiration patterns were closely observed.\n\nEach emotion was associated with a distinct respiration pattern. For example, when the participants were happy they breathed slowly and fully, when they felt anxious or afraid they breathed more quickly and shallowly. In a follow-up study the researchers instructed a different group of participants to breathe in the same patterns they had observed in the first study. The participants started to feel the corresponding emotion to whatever breathing pattern they used!\n\nBreathe slowly and fully, it enables better thinking and makes you feel more positive.\n\n## Happiness Step #2: The True Key - Become More Present\n\nhttp://i64.tinypic.com/210ksbd.jpg\n\nDon\u2019t put your happiness on hold because you\u2019re waiting for something to happen, it might not. There are no guarantees you\u2019re going to get that new job, car or anything for that matter.\n\nIf you detach yourself from the outcome and enjoy the journey you\u2019ll become fully present, living in the moment, and truly experiencing what life is about. You will have found happiness, all from within. It\u2019s contagious too... others will begin to pick up your habit, then it\u2019ll be reflected back to you.\n\nAll we really have is today, so take stock of what you really need, and try to appreciate your life more with each passing day.\n\n> \u201cHappiness, true happiness, is an inner quality. It is a state of mind. If your mind is at peace, you are happy. If your mind is at peace, but you have nothing else, you can be happy. If you have everything the world can give - pleasure, possessions, power - but lack peace of mind, you can never be happy.\u201d - Dada Vaswani\n\nHave gratitude, help others, and most of all be happy.",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><em>As the Rio Olympics were getting underway this summer, I was reminiscing with a friend from </em><a href=\"http://www.mises.org.br/\"><em>Instituto Mises Brasil</em></a><em> about a film that both of us found remarkably enjoyable and inspirational.</em> <em>He convinced me to write an article about it.</em> <em>As I have no blog, I figured here would be a good place to start.</em> <em>Believe it or not the following is a movie review\u2026 the preface is my own personal take on how this documentary related to me and my experience.</em></p>\n<p>I'm a descendant of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_evacuation_and_expulsion\">Eastern European displacement of World War II</a>. &nbsp;Growing up in Midwestern USA in the 1980s and 1990s, during a time when the US was thriving and the Soviet Union was crumbling, I always found it difficult to explain the impact of what was going on in Eastern Europe to my childhood friends.</p>\n<p>But it was a big deal. Looking back it\u2019s become clear that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major turning point in not only the 20th century, but in a centuries\u2019 long battle of ideas among economic thinkers, from Adam Smith to Karl Marx to John Maynard Keynes to Ludwig von Mises, to name a few. The stunning defaults, crumbling infrastructure, and stagnating freedom of expression that all culminated in the (primarily peaceful) collapse of one of the two world superpowers at the time\u2014the <em>communist</em> one\u2014was a huge, huge victory for the freedom of mankind.</p>\n<p>Not that I myself had any real idea what was going on. I was too young to comprehend most of this. But I did know that a large portion of the groundswell for independence was emanating from the place where my relatives lived. A place I had never been to, never seen in person, but had learned about on the weekends in Latvian school, and from stories my father and grandparents told. I was quite aware, and proud, that the first three breakaway nations to secede from the Soviet Union, collectively known as the Baltic States, were Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</p>\n<p>But I remember always struggling to bring any comprehension or connection to what I was hearing at home and among Latvian circles to friends back at school. And there was good reason they should have cared. It was a scary time, as the masks were pulled away from the apparatchiks in the Kremlin, no one could be certain how the cards would fall. Would there be large swaths of violence, as the power slipped through their fingertips? The second half of the old Soviet joke, \u201cSo long as the bosses pretend to pay us, we will pretend to work,\u201d was not holding anymore. Lithuania became the first breakaway nation to declare its independence in March 1990. The first violent attack against this freedom movement occurred in January 1991, when Soviet troops killed 14 people and injured hundreds more in Vilnius, Lithuania\u2019s capital. The Lithuanians were crescendoing their rallies for recognized independence, forming barricades to protect their institutions (like the radio and television stations, and parliament) from the Soviet troops still on the ground, digging in their heels.</p>\n<p>To be clear, this wasn\u2019t the first movement for freedom and independence in the illegally annexed Baltic States. After the Soviet Union occupied the three nations in 1944, for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Brothers\">over 10 years there was calculated guerrilla warfare</a> waged against the Stalinist regime, even into the late 1950s. And certainly there were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Soviet_partisans\">many movements fighting for freedom across the Soviet Union and its satellites</a> for decades. Likewise, the violence in Vilnius in 1991 (and more followed in Riga) were not the first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_Communist_regimes\">signs of aggression in the Soviet Union against its own citizens</a> (those citizens being illegally incorporated or not).</p>\n<p>Back in the United States, we played our own small roles. I recall going to rallies in major cities and seeing my father (always active in foreign Latvian politics and immigrant cultural heritage) speak for independence on the news. I incorporated these events into school projects. But again, I was young, and my friends had more important things to do. I had more important things to do.</p>\n<p>And then it happened. Almost with the flick of a switch, the old regime crumbled. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing_Revolution\">The Singing Revolution</a> had achieved its goal, peacefully. Something my grandparents had only dreamed about was finally a reality. Freedom. At last. A white sheet. The Baltics were free, their independence recognized (first internationally by Iceland\u2026 side note, it\u2019s always Iceland, how great are they?!). Other satellites such as Georgia and Armenia quickly followed suit in declaring their own independence. Just like that, in December 1991, the Soviet Union was dissolved. Absolutely remarkable.</p>\n<p>And just as quickly as it ended, everyone realized they needed to rebuild. Fast. <em>Because these nations were behind.</em></p>\n<p>The key takeaway I believe everyone should remember from this time is how stark the economic and cultural contrast really was then between East and West. How utterly stumped\u2014economically and financially\u2014the Soviet Union was at its dissolution in 1991, when matched against its counterpart nations in Western Europe and North America. And remember, in total, the Soviet Union was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_largest_historical_GDP\"><em>the second largest economy in the world</em></a><em>.</em> This fact alone, combined with the blunt economic juxtaposition between East and West as the Berlin wall came crumbling down, should make anyone think twice about defending socialism of any kind. People just couldn\u2019t see it. At the time, the combination of propaganda, lack of free press, and lack of internet probably contributed most to this stunning misinformation and misunderstanding between \u201cthem,\u201d and \u201cus\u201d (such perceptions no doubt shared equally and oppositely from both sides of the iron curtain). And yet today, with all of our leaps and bounds in technology and understanding, this battle of economic ideas rages on. People lose interest in the past. People forget. So I firmly believe we should remember this particular battle in perpetuity, as for 50 years it was truly the largest scale economic clash of <em>planned</em> versus <em>free</em> societies the world had ever seen. One more note, there is no time here to qualify all the (many) things Western nations didn\u2019t do well in the 20th century. Rather, on a higher level, I find it hard to argue for the completely disastrous, authoritarian policies of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It\u2019s hard to argue for socialism.</p>\n<p>A lesson worth remembering.</p>\n<p>A quick recap on how the Baltic States in particular have gotten on since then. My first trip to Latvia was in 1996, and coming from a life in the US, it was by far the least developed country I had stepped foot in. The capital Riga was completely dark (I mean no street lights, seemingly no lights at all) in the evenings, almost scary at times. Rusted pipes and plumbing no matter where you stayed. Every car on the road was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAZ-2101\">hilariously old</a>. &nbsp;The potted roads would seem a luxury once one traveled a few kilometers outside the capital city to the countryside. If and when you finally did arrive at your rural destination, you almost expected dueling banjos to be heard through the trees. But the music? Far better in fact. Disco. That is, if you could find a caf\u00e9 with a stereo. Yet that genre was probably fitting, as it wasn\u2019t a stretch to compare the place to 1970s Western economic levels (if that).</p>\n<p>I moved to live in Latvia full time 10 years later, in 2006. The Ladas had been swapped for Volkswagens. The city had brightened up in a big way. Booms in construction. The disco remained. Fair enough. But the gap was closing.</p>\n<p>10 years later it\u2019s 2016 and I\u2019m still here. The country is still one of the least wealthy in the EU\u2014to be expected when its Western counterparts had such an economic head start\u2014but it is light years ahead of what I witnessed in 1996. Latvia joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) earlier this year, so it seems we can now call it a developed nation, country #35 to join that club. Though I\u2019m Latvian, I\u2019ve had plenty of travel and work experience in Estonia (also in the OECD) and Lithuania, each beautiful and progressing in their own right. Most importantly, they have their freedom.</p>\n<p>But this journey, all these years, for me, was personal. I had some understanding, and knew the backstory. Thinking again about that kid growing up in Midwestern USA, observing the collapse of the USSR back in the 1990s, and since then increasing my own understanding (perhaps more than the average person) of how this was an incredibly meaningful, positive change for society\u2014how could I have more persuasively expressed it all back then to my childhood friends? To my community? More importantly, <em>how can I today</em> still express how crucial these (ongoing) battles for freedom and independence really are?</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve had old friends come visit me over the years, make the trip to the Wild Wild East, see that it\u2019s not so wild anymore. Sure, they\u2019d hear some stories of the grind from communist times, the bread lines, the black markets, the survival mentality my family members had to take in certain situations, even tales of Siberian deportations after the Second World War. But today, if you visit, those things seem very far away. Today, things are pretty damn comfortable and pleasant here, <em>so it\u2019s easy to forget how far we\u2019ve come</em>. Remember, 25 years ago you couldn\u2019t even own real assets in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>So I keep coming back to these same questions. 25 years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union\u2014<em>why should anyone care </em>about what happened here? How do you illustrate this amazing fight for freedom against the world\u2019s most authoritarian superpower at the time? How do we keep inspiring others in the same fight? Do people really understand how important the economic, political and individual freedoms being chased today by those in Ukraine, Bahrain, Iran, Myanmar, Cuba and plenty of other places around the world really are?</p>\n<p>A few years ago, I came across a film that addressed all of the aforementioned questions, and more.</p>\n<p>Something entertaining, something interesting, something thought-provoking.</p>\n<p>Something for history buffs; something for people who don\u2019t care much for history at all.</p>\n<p>Something for sports fans; something for people who couldn\u2019t care less for sports.</p>\n<p>Something for those with national pride; something for those who lack that spark and interest in where they come from. Something inspirational\u2026 about liberty.</p>\n<p>The film is called <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606829/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\"><em>The Other Dream Team</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The fight for freedom and independence, inspired. The story is told through the eyes of the 1992 Lithuanian Men\u2019s Basketball team competing at the Barcelona Olympics. The same Olympics where Magic, Michael and Larry stormed Las Ramblas in Barcelona with 8 other Hall of Famers (and Christian Laettner!) known as the Dream Team. A true treat to watch, the first time pros competed for the US at the Olympics, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtoHD89ylSw\">they were a hurricane</a>. But what many forget from that same Olympics in 1992\u2014a whisker in time after the Soviet Union fell apart\u2014was who took the podium after an extremely intense bronze medal game.</p>\n<p>Lithuania. Free Lithuania. It was a game in which a newly independent Lithuania faced their former Soviet teammates from the CIS team, and in a way their former Soviet occupier.</p>\n<p>I cannot recommend this film highly enough. I\u2019m not even Lithuanian. But my brothers across the border who have come to be known as the Green Machine in international basketball are truly an inspirational group\u2014both then and now\u2014and this story puts a human touch on their nation\u2019s ultimate fight for freedom during that volatile time. Again, this film is not just about sports, and will match almost anyone\u2019s attention span. It will show you what life was like during Soviet times, and the tremendous obstacles they had to overcome. This is the movie, back in the 1990s, <em>I wish I could have just pressed \u201cplay\u201d to</em>, when attempting to explain to my friends and community what the hell was going on in Eastern Europe, and why it was time to give freedom a chance. Watch this film, and you will understand.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and the Grateful Dead played a role, too.</p>\n<p>It probably goes without saying that I think this story is just as important today. I\u2019m not much for politicized debates about a resurgent Russia or a militant US or how China should fit in or the proper balance of global hegemony that some pundit believes is most appropriate. But I am a sucker for inspiration, especially when it\u2019s conveyed effectively and poignantly and unabashedly in favor of freedom and liberty. These are the stories we need to be reminded of. And not only in Eastern Europe. I genuinely hope to see many more tales of hope and freedom from athletes and teams peacefully chasing their goals against the odds under oppressed regimes around the world today. Sometimes we all need a little inspiration. It is an Olympic year, after all.</p>\n<p>If you have any other stories to recommend (Olympics-related or not), I for one would be delighted to hear about them.</p>\n<p>As I\u2019ve done for many years, I urge everyone to check out this film. I promise you will not be disappointed.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>A small Coda. 24 years after Barcelona, the Olympics in Rio are over. The Lithuanian Men\u2019s Basketball team started strong, going 3-0 in its first three games, but they limped into the quarterfinals after losing the next two in the group, and didn\u2019t make it past Australia in the round of 8. A disappointing outcome for them, but as a country of only 3 million, on the international basketball stage they continue to punch well above their weight. &nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

It such a rife subject even in developed nations that political ambitions can be made or broken depending on one's stance about this. Unfortunately so many people have failed to realize that this is quite a private subject for men. There are circumstances that stem up and would make a man have to make a serious decision about his health and his future.\n\nTherefore no socio-political, cultural or religious factor should be made to take the place of his decision. A man should have the right to choose whether he wants to keep a child or not. After all it is his wallet, his wealth and his future that is in jeopardy.\n\n![](https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft2.gstatic.com%2Fimages%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcReT4wovWfBByJ2G5q0g7NtdeBNiEBw3UkbpzxENjTi7jhH6LDYzQ&sp=e88be8f88c2ebf5e6b418d469f046195)\n\nIt is, however, unfortunate that a lot of countries continue to criminalize and shame so-called \"dead-beat dads\" even when the wealth of the father is at stake.\n\nFor instance a man called Terry Power. *His face tightened as he listened to his wife's attorney tick off their assets on the final day of his divorce trial. He sat in a leather chair at a glass-covered table inside a paneled judicial chamber and he thought not for the first time that her voice annoyed him.*\n\n*The Jet Ski . . . his wife's attorney said.*\n\n*\"Sold to pay attorney fees,\" Terry interjected.*\n\n*The IRA account?*\n\n*\"Distributed to pay property taxes on the marital property.\"*\n\n*The Raymond James investment account?*\n\n*\"Gone.\"*\n\n*Terry's wife, Murielle, petite with blond highlights, stared at him as if he were an insect, then looked down at her hands. After five years in divorce court, they were like old prizefighters in their respective corners.*\n\n*In February 2008, when Murielle Marie Helene Fournier vs. Terrance Paul Power was but a single document inside a purple file at the Pinellas County Courthouse, when Terry had his own business and made $250,000 a year, he thought of divorce court as a place where grievances were smoothed over and order restored. Now as he represented himself in his own divorce trial because he couldn't afford an attorney, his case having grown to 28 volumes and costing about $400,000 (much of it still unpaid), he viewed the system of marital justice as a journey down the rabbit hole.*\n\n*The gold coins?*\n\n*\"I have no idea.\"*\n\n*The hutch?*\n\n*\"Sold.\"*\n\n*As their divorce trial concluded, Murielle's attorney finally got around to alimony, the issue that had bogged down the case from the start. Terry had delivered his first of six alimony offers to Murielle a month after the divorce was filed: $5,400 a month until he retired, plus $50,000 cash and half the contents of their million-dollar home, which was underwater. The last letter, delivered to her attorney the month before the trial, offered her zero.*\n\n*\"Frankly I don't give a crap if she settles or not,\" he had written. \"I'd rather see her waste even more money. Like she made me do for these past four years.\"*\n\n*Now Murielle's attorney suggested a different amount: \"She's 50 years old and she doesn't have many skills, Judge . . . $6,500 a month should keep her in a decent place.\"*\n\n*Terry rolled his eyes.*\n\n*(adapted from [here](http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/the-divorce-from-hell-the-battle-for-alimony-and-emptied-pockets/2112875))*\n\n![](https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft3.gstatic.com%2Fimages%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcTmQO0c1JzFPIMQa8Ru-GZ7uNCxPWjtmSjsXXAPtrF28Vpp_Emaow&sp=1c9cf8d87d7d7625aba83f15e30270f3)\n\nMarriage is a very risky condition for the modern man and a lot of men are going to run into complications during this period and suicide is going to be their only saving grace. To cancel this option before hand for them is very inhumane thing to do as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\n![](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1906336.1408258966!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/news-robinwilliams-obit-2-la.jpg)\n\nIn another sad antithetical case, men in most countries are being forced to pay alimony when they clearly do not want such procedures carried out on them. In the United States, in order to uphold the nonsensical drivel of feminist policy, men are forced to go to jail if they refuse to pay - even if the child is not theirs!\n\nIn Switzerland, as many other places, men are forbidden from seeing their children, many times due to false allegations on the part of the mother. It is referred to as female deception. [Recently a new born baby girl was found in a dumpster and had to be rushed to the hospital to received urgent medical attention](http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/london-ont-police-charge-23-year-old-mother-two-days-after-dead-baby-found-in-dumpster).\n\n![](https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft3.gstatic.com%2Fimages%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcTqkHuavHk3tNlbtsfZBsUMPdGt6YUNf3b6AmoqFh-F-wd3DWJL-g&sp=dfc9275990e22e1e14f3e6bc00de0df2)\n\nThere are other cases where a man should be allowed to have a future. For example if he is not ready, financially, to support a child it is very unhealthy for such a gentleman to be forced to carry that child to adulthood. Many gentlemen have had to quit school in order to take up poor paying jobs to support a child they were not ready to have. For the welfare of father and child, young gentlemen should be allowed to make decisions on whether they want to keep paying or not.\n\n![](https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft3.gstatic.com%2Fimages%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcTcjI0bLH3GAUML1JKT0gnY073u7KcK6nxcxuz_XM_DOtJslMI6SA&sp=ffe625608bf04a3406b769867fbfab1e)\n\nMost men also get broke from horrifying experiences like divorce rape and to force such a gentleman to keep a child that will only remind him of an unfortunate and painful wife is very wicked. Most people will argue that divorce involves taking the life of an innocent man but they are just a mass of undeveloped testicles that are not even a complete human yet. It doesn't even have a developed nervous system yet and as such cannot feel emotions. And it is even sad that most religions try to guilt people into keeping a marriage at the expense of the husbands's happiness. The fathers\u2019s decision should always hold supreme as it is his wallet and he should have the final decision on what he wants to do with it. And he can always live to have healthy babies in the future.\n\n![](http://www.brocode.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/brobama.jpg)",

    "body": "It's been a busy week for me, I've started 5 or 6 projects, cancelled/froze one of them, and finished two of them.\n\nThis witness update is a little bit late, but I haven't had much to show until now. My witness server has been up and running 24/7, and I haven't missed a single block, despite running for several weeks now, and going through a hard-fork.\n\nWhat have I done this past week?\n-----\n\n### Created ANONSTEEM - for anonymous STEEM accounts\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y6QDDbD.png)\n\nAnonSteem is my latest medium-sized project. A few people I know have a strong hatred towards social media accounts, and there weren't really any other methods of obtaining accounts outside of steemit.com\n\nSo, I created AnonSteem, where you can purchase your account upfront by paying AnonSteem your creation fee in BTC/LTC. I wasn't certain if it would take off, but there's been quite a few account creations so far, and I hit the frontpage with the post.\n\n**Post:** [ANONSTEEM - Create Anonymous Steem Accounts without social media](https://steemit.com/steemit/@someguy123/anonsteem-create-anonymous-steem-accounts-without-social-media)\n\n### Fixed several issues on @xeroc's Piston library\n\nWhile working on AnonSteem, I found two separate issues in the account creation system of Piston, I ended up taking the matter into my own hands, created a fix for the issues, and sent a pull request to solve the issues for everyone.\n\n**Post:** [Have you created any accounts via Piston? Your owner keys and posting keys are swapped!](https://steemit.com/steem-help/@someguy123/have-you-created-any-accounts-via-piston-your-owner-keys-and-posting-keys-are-swapped)\n\n### Ran a game giveaway to try to bootstrap the Game Review category\n\nThe post was also to possibly help me gain some more STEEM power, while at the same time giving out a game in a fair and verifiable way, however it fell flat. Many people loved the idea though, and it helped encourage people to keep writing their reviews.\n\n**Post:** https://steemit.com/gaming/@someguy123/steam-game-giveaway-outlast\n\n### Steem-in-a-box\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XOsLHJQ.png)\nAs you might recall from my last witness update, one problem I was trying to solve was the installation effort. I solved it partially with up-to-date instructions on [STEEM.CENTER](https://www.steem.center), but I wanted something better.\n\nSteem-in-a-box is a small shell script designed to make dealing with STEEM inside of a Docker container painless. While the post didn't get too much attention, it has been useful to myself and a few others.\n\nThe most important point of Steem-in-a-box is that using the one-liner in the post, you're able to set up a STEEM seed, witness, or RPC server without having to do anything at all, other than set up your `config.ini` file\n\n**Post:** [Steem-in-a-box - Deploy a new seed, witness, or RPC server with a one-liner](https://steemit.com/steem/@someguy123/steem-in-a-box-deploy-a-new-seed-witness-or-rpc-server-with-a-one-liner)\n\n### Joined the Wiki Content Team\n\n@ned recently asked for people to work on improving the poor quality of documentation for STEEM, for both new users and developers.\n\nI have teamed up with @dragonho and @serejandmyself as the \"Steemit Wiki Content Team\", working together on a new possibly official wiki and FAQ for STEEM/Steemit, so new users don't have to check across 5 different sites, and hundreds of outdated STEEM posts to find the information they need.\n\nIf you think you can help out, feel free to join #wiki on the Steemit.CHAT and let us know where your expertise lies.\n\n\nWhat am I doing next?\n------\n\nI'm going to be continuing to work on new STEEM services, while at the same time working with other people in the community to improve existing services, as well as working with the Steemit Wiki Content Team to produce good quality information to help people out.\n\nI love the idea of a censorship resistant, free (libre) platform, and I may continue to work on more services for that aspect, but may venture out to other areas where I see useful to the community.\n\nCheck out my last witness update [HERE](https://steemit.com/witness-category/@someguy123/someguy123-s-witness-update-2016-08-19)\n----\n\nDo you like what I've been doing?

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Shit gets rough every now and then. Life is a pain and sometimes you just need something to pick yourself up out of a rut and into a new mind frame.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are 5 simple things you can do if you are not having the greatest day. They can simply change your mood and take you from one negative state to a more optimistic and <a href=\"www.instagram.com\">positive one.&nbsp;</a></p>\n<h2><img src=\"http://www.in-spirelsmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Think-Positive-In-spire-LS-Magazine-2.jpg\"/></h2>\n<h2>1. Put on your Jam And Throw Away Some Junk&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Yup pump up your latest \"jam\" and start throwing junk out! One way to decide what to throw out is ask your self these two questions.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>When was the last time I used this? If the answer is 6 months ago or more....then...</li>\n  <li>Do I really need to keep it? Or can it go to a better home.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. One persons trash is another persons treasure.&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Don't just throw it in the bin, pass it on to a new home. Go donate it. Someone can probably put it to good use! So this is a sure fire way to start a chain of positivity. Act positive and you will be positive.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>3. Surround Yourself With Humour And A Good Friend.&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Pick up the phone and say hello to a friend. Have a laugh, get your funny endorphins rolling around in your body. There is no better way to do this than to make a connection with someone and have a giggle.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4. Reminisce A Little&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>This is an odd one, but the brain often glorifies good moments in your life. So pull out the photo album of your last wild getaway or family holiday and have a think of the good times. This will put a smile on your dial.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>5. Plan Something</h2>\n<p>Last but not least put a plan on paper, book a little trip, book a night out and go to the cinemas. We all need to have things we look forward to on a weekly basis, this is the stuff that keeps you going . You place the light at the end of the tunnel no on else. So turn on the light and plan a little night :)&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I hope you found these helpful. They are things I do all the time if I'm not feeling the best! Share with us below what you do. :)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>#steemit #steemzine #psychology #life &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

My response of 'mining' was quickly met with an elongated pause with 'huh?' immediately proceeding. It was in this moment which I was stuck with the daunting task of making my best attempt to explain exactly what the heck I was doing. Recalling my prior failed efforts to accurately explain this to others, I decided on a different approach. I'm not sure how this came about as I had not invested any time on this analogy prior, but I simply said, 'Mining Steem and crypto-currencies is like being a Taxi Driver.'</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://hireagreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Cab.jpg\"/></center></p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://hireagreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Cab.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<h2>What does a Taxi Driver do?</h2>\n<blockquote>A taxi driver is a professional driver who transports passengers to their chosen destinations through the use of a taxi cab. By transporting their passengers, they earn a fare depending on the length of the taxi cab ride.</blockquote>\n<p>https://www.sokanu.com/careers/taxi-driver/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Why does one want to be a Taxi Driver?</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>They earn a fare</li>\n  <li>They enjoy driving</li>\n  <li>They are comforatable being in a vehicle</li>\n  <li>They like the company of others</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why does one want to be Miner?</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>they earn a reward</li>\n  <li>they enjoy technology</li>\n  <li>they are comfortable being on a computer</li>\n  <li>they like crypto-currencies</li>\n</ol><center>\n<h2>Just for the Money?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/653*367/stripper+generic+black+white.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/653*367/stripper+generic+black+white.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<p>Before venturing into the first desire above, it is important to realize that cumulative weight of secondary motivations and beyond are typically necessary to achieve the fare/reward. From my understanding (and definitely not from waking up in the morning hundreds of dollars short than when I started the night prior!) individuals who dance and take their clothes off can make a very large 'fare/reward' as well! Knowing this, doesn't that mean I should do that too?! For me, the answer is a hard NO. I personally do not have the confidence, dancing abilities or free-natured spirit those individuals have. In the same light, a person who despises driving, is scared in a vehicle and loathes the company of others, likely wouldn't make a very good Taxi Driver. Lastly, individuals who are scared of technology, frightened by computers and do not want to be around crypto-currencies would have a difficult time mining.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<center><h2>Now that we understand how important the combined weight of secondary motivations are to one's decision to become either a Taxi Driver or a Miner, let's explore how exactly a fare/reward is made.&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.marilynomalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MoneyMap.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marilynomalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MoneyMap.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The job of the Taxi Driver is to navigate geographic terrain to a specified location provided by the passenger. Payment of a fare from the passenger to the Taxi Driver is confirmation that the job was executed successfully.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>In terms of mining, the job of the miner is to navigate digital data in an attempt to verify digital contracts and transfers from other users (passengers). Payment of a reward from other users to the miner is confirmation that the digital data was successfully verified. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If the Taxi Driver is unsuccessful and drops the passenger off at a different location, or his vehicle breaks down, the passenger does not need to provide compensation regardless of how close they are. Even if the Taxi Driver arrives at the correct location but several hours later than originally required, compensation may and probably won't be provided.</li>\n  <li>If a miner is unsuccessful in verifying assigned transactions of digital data, no reward will be provided. If the miner confirms transactions hours or days later, no reward will be provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Ok, so this seems broad enough for most individuals to understand. Let us explore what is required to make all this happen.&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4d/21/3c/4d213c01fdfc017db9394ecd19a2dffc.jpg\" width=\"736\" height=\"920\"/></center></p>\n<p><center><a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4d/21/3c/4d213c01fdfc017db9394ecd19a2dffc.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<p>Taxi Drivers should have the following items in order to receive a fare:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>A Vehicle --- The Taxi Driver does not need to own one. Some Taxi Drivers work for a company who provide one to them for a cost.</li>\n  <li>Gasoline</li>\n  <li>A Map/GPS</li>\n  <li>A pocket for cash payments or a Credit Card machine to take payments</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Miners should have the following items in order to receive a reward: &nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>A Computer --- The Miner does not need to own one. Some Miners pay for a computer in the 'cloud.' If a miner chooses this option, a fee will be paid from the Miner to the company providing the computer.</li>\n  <li>Electricity</li>\n  <li>An interface which provides their computer with the information they need to verify</li>\n  <li>A digital wallet to receive payment of their rewards</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br></p><center>\n<h2>I have all of those items! So now I need to sit at my computer all day and actively mine?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxgdqeHIut1qcpel0.jpg\" width=\"251\" height=\"205\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxgdqeHIut1qcpel0.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<p>Nope. When you first get in to a Taxi it is stationary and the driver is paying attention to you to find out where you want to go. From there,&nbsp;the driver typically has a conversation on his phone, chit-chats with you, drinks coffee, eats and obsessively blows his horn. The actual driving of the vehicle for the Taxi Driver is second nature to him and he has an amazing ability to multi-task. The Taxi Driver did all of those&nbsp;things for your entire trip but ultimately he got you to your destination... so you paid him.</p>\n<p>The same goes for mining. You turn on your computer and point the mining program to it's digital destination. From there you are able to&nbsp;minimize the program and do anything else you so choose to. The computer knows in the background what needs to be done and just does it for&nbsp;you.</p>\n<p><br></p><center>\n<h2>Are you telling me that I can Mine while streaming Netflix and building a huge customer database for my company at the same time?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://lisasatomidotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/dsc04533-e1406962297583.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lisasatomidotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/dsc04533-e1406962297583.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<p>Everything has limitations. For the Taxi Driver who uses a Ford Focus for a vehicle, it would be quite difficult for him to pick of a family of 15&nbsp;Sumo Wrestlers. This is difficult for two reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The Taxi Driver will likely not have the space in his Ford Focus for the family.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>If&nbsp;he is Harry Houdini and somehow fits them all in, the weight of the car will be so tremendous it would take hours to arrive at the&nbsp;destination.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The same is true for your computer. Mining requires you to have memory and processing power. The Memory is equivalent to the space inside of&nbsp;the Ford Focus. The Processing Power is equivalent to the speed of the Ford Focus. If your other activities take up a lot of memory, or slow down&nbsp;your computer's speed, then it is recommended to using the mining tool when you are not actively using your computer.</p>\n<center><p><img src=\"http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae329/lzsleggs/currency/NYTransittokensideA.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"352\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae329/lzsleggs/currency/NYTransittokensideA.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<p>Admittingly this analogy does not afford a person the resources to go and create CabCoin anytime soon. It was sufficient enough however for Trena who told me that she understood and appreciated the explanation. After which came another elongated pause and then she asked, 'So, we're going to become millionaires now?!'</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgsafe.org/dd8bd8753d.gif\" width=\"156\" height=\"70\"/></p>\n</center><center><p>Please share, upvote and follow if you enjoyed this Original Content.

But we still do not have through understanding regarding the current situations, such as how much whales have influences on rewards, or how unequal the situation is. In this post, I would like to introduce two new statistics, 1) Influences on (author) rewards, 2) Influence to Steem Power Ratio (IPR), to provide more comprehensive knowledge about the whale issue.\n\n\n\n## Methods\n\nThe data is from Steem blockchain from 2016/8/16 (After v0.13.0) to 2016/9/8.\nInfluences of whales on rewards is calculated based on the following equations.\n\n```\n- Rshares of a post: sum(voters_rshares)\n- Vshares of a post: (posts_rshares)^2\n- Daily vshares: sum(posts_vshares)\n- Voter's vshares on a post: posts_vshares * (voters_rshares / posts_rshares)\n- Voter's daily vshares: sum(voters_vshares)\n- Voter's influence: voters_daily_vshares / daily_vshares\n```\n\nTo get IPR, we just need a simple equation.\n```\n- IPR = Influence / (voters_vests / total_vests)\n```\n*Note: Steemit account's vests are excluded from total_vests*\n\n\n## Results\n\nRank | Account | Influence(%) | Steem Power (%) | IPR\n:----:|:----:|----|----|----\n1\t|\tsmooth\t|\t13.34\t|\t2.86\t|\t4.67\n2\t|\tblocktrades\t|\t11.60\t|\t3.71\t|\t3.13\n3\t|\tberniesanders\t|\t10.55\t|\t2.97\t|\t3.55\n4\t|\tsteemed\t|\t3.92\t|\t1.62\t|\t2.42\n5\t|\titsascam\t|\t3.82\t|\t1.53\t|\t2.49\n6\t|\ttombstone\t|\t3.62\t|\t1.87\t|\t1.93\n7\t|\tdantheman\t|\t3.51\t|\t2.54\t|\t1.38\n8\t|\tsummon\t|\t3.11\t|\t1.29\t|\t2.41\n9\t|\tjamesc\t|\t2.78\t|\t3.20\t|\t0.87\n10\t|\tcomplexring\t|\t2.37\t|\t0.67\t|\t3.52\n11\t|\tsmooth.witness\t|\t2.32\t|\t0.53\t|\t4.37\n12\t|\twang\t|\t1.97\t|\t0.66\t|\t2.97\n13\t|\tnextgencrypto\t|\t1.81\t|\t0.51\t|\t3.53\n14\t|\trainman\t|\t1.78\t|\t1.51\t|\t1.18\n15\t|\trecursive\t|\t1.56\t|\t0.31\t|\t5.11\n16\t|\tsilversteem\t|\t1.55\t|\t0.46\t|\t3.39\n17\t|\triverhead\t|\t1.53\t|\t0.68\t|\t2.23\n18\t|\tpharesim\t|\t1.53\t|\t0.88\t|\t1.74\n19\t|\tned\t|\t1.52\t|\t5.73\t|\t0.27\n20\t|\tsteemit200\t|\t1.38\t|\t0.57\t|\t2.42\n21\t|\tsteempty\t|\t1.30\t|\t0.69\t|\t1.87\n22\t|\tkushed\t|\t1.15\t|\t0.50\t|\t2.29\n23\t|\txeldal\t|\t1.15\t|\t0.64\t|\t1.79\n24\t|\thr1\t|\t1.00\t|\t0.21\t|\t4.69\n25\t|\tsatoshifund\t|\t0.99\t|\t0.35\t|\t2.85\n26\t|\tenki\t|\t0.91\t|\t0.53\t|\t1.71\n27\t|\tval-a\t|\t0.91\t|\t2.80\t|\t0.32\n28\t|\tsilver\t|\t0.74\t|\t0.19\t|\t3.85\n29\t|\tau1nethyb1\t|\t0.72\t|\t0.42\t|\t1.71\n30\t|\tbadassmother\t|\t0.63\t|\t0.26\t|\t2.44\n\nSurprisingly, top 10 have about 60% (actually over 60% since `smooth` and `smooth.witness` is controlled by same person) of author rewards, while they only have 22% of Steem Power. And the top 3 (`smooth`, `blocktrades`, `berniesanders` consist of 35.5% of influences, for instance, if daily author reward is $20,000, about $7,000 is from these three's voting activities. The average IPR of the top 10 is 2.63, but if we do the same calculation with rank 41~50, they only have IPR of 0.75. This means that influences on rewards is unequally distributed, more specifically it is biased to some whales.\n\n![](http://i.imgsafe.org/26684444a1.jpg)\n\nAdditionally, I calculated some basic statics about top rankers voting patterns.\n\n- Range: Number of unique writers they voted for\n- Mean: Average number of votes per writer\n- Max: Maximum number of votes on a writer\n- Stdev: Standard deviation of votes\n\nRank | Account | Range | Mean | Max | Stdev\n:----:|:----:|----|----|----|----\n1\t|\tsmooth\t|\t340\t|\t2.32\t|\t65\t|\t7.49\n2\t|\tblocktrades\t|\t480\t|\t1.31\t|\t22.4\t|\t1.51\n3\t|\tberniesanders\t|\t785\t|\t1.27\t|\t14.5\t|\t1.7\n4\t|\tsteemed\t|\t80\t|\t3.64\t|\t44\t|\t6.43\n5\t|\titsascam\t|\t79\t|\t3.69\t|\t44\t|\t6.49\n6\t|\ttombstone\t|\t196\t|\t1.64\t|\t12.1\t|\t2.18\n7\t|\tdantheman\t|\t339\t|\t0.66\t|\t10.3\t|\t1.23\n8\t|\tsummon\t|\t220\t|\t1.65\t|\t14.4\t|\t1.99\n9\t|\tjamesc\t|\t135\t|\t1.1\t|\t12.8\t|\t1.81\n10\t|\tcomplexring\t|\t534\t|\t1.75\t|\t39\t|\t3.04\n11\t|\tsmooth.witness\t|\t324\t|\t2.4\t|\t65\t|\t7.61\n12\t|\twang\t|\t213\t|\t8.29\t|\t82\t|\t10.41\n13\t|\tnextgencrypto\t|\t755\t|\t1.4\t|\t14\t|\t1.51\n14\t|\trainman\t|\t170\t|\t1.18\t|\t9.7\t|\t1.3\n15\t|\trecursive\t|\t121\t|\t9.78\t|\t51\t|\t11.76\n16\t|\tsilversteem\t|\t760\t|\t1.82\t|\t15\t|\t2.08\n17\t|\triverhead\t|\t334\t|\t1.53\t|\t12.6\t|\t1.4\n18\t|\tpharesim\t|\t404\t|\t2.03\t|\t54\t|\t3.89\n19\t|\tned\t|\t238\t|\t0.18\t|\t2.6\t|\t0.35\n20\t|\tsteemit200\t|\t175\t|\t2.41\t|\t13\t|\t2.29\n21\t|\tsteempty\t|\t164\t|\t2.89\t|\t34\t|\t4.84\n22\t|\tkushed\t|\t250\t|\t2.61\t|\t84\t|\t7.36\n23\t|\txeldal\t|\t204\t|\t2.92\t|\t48\t|\t5.65\n24\t|\thr1\t|\t104\t|\t10.34\t|\t52\t|\t11.86\n25\t|\tsatoshifund\t|\t130\t|\t2.51\t|\t21\t|\t3.61\n26\t|\tenki\t|\t174\t|\t3.22\t|\t46\t|\t5.58\n27\t|\tval-a\t|\t75\t|\t0.36\t|\t1.5\t|\t0.42\n28\t|\tsilver\t|\t763\t|\t1.83\t|\t15\t|\t2.13\n29\t|\tau1nethyb1\t|\t205\t|\t1.97\t|\t11\t|\t1.79\n30\t|\tbadassmother\t|\t235\t|\t2.75\t|\t15\t|\t2.77\n\n\n\nAmong these statistics, max and stdev should be highlighted, since higher numbers imply that a whale's voting is very concentrated (possibily due to his/her preferences or favorable connection with authors?), and this can further create perception of inequality. (People recursively see high rewards on same author's posts). For comparison, while `blocktrades` and `berniesanders` have similar influences with `smooth`, they have much lower max and stdev, which implies that their votes are widely dispersed to many writers. But we can see very high max and stdev in `hr1`, `recursive`, `wang`, and `smooth`. In addition, we can find `smooth` and `smooth.witness`, and `recursive` and `hr1` have the similar patterns respectively, probably because each pair of accounts is using the same voting bot.\n\n\n## Wrap-up\n\nThe results show that influence is much higher than whales' actual steem power, especially by active whale bots. In my humble opinion, the fundamental cause is the squared rshares, which makes large voting power much greater. We need further discussion about this issue and have to address it for better Steem society.\n\n\n### P.S. Do you think that I have to post these stats everyday, weekly, or monthly? (Everyday data has influence and IPR only because the second table requires more samples)",

Why don't things change in the world? \n\nMost people don't learn from their mistakes, and keep repeating them. Most people lack an accurate understanding of truth about the current condition of reality. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/makingmistakesconfucius1b411.jpg\" alt=\"makingmistakesconfucius1b411.jpg\" /></center>\n\nMost people don't seem to want to learn, as most people (in general) lack real Care for Truth, busy with work, surviving, having fun, etc., yet we dream and hope to do the **right thing** to fix our problems in our ignorant state. \n\nDreams can be fantasy unrealities and blind us to reality. This is wishful thinking, a \"positivity\" mask placed over reality with rosy colored glasses that prevents us from seeing things as they really are. Some of us are too fixated on the pleasure trap of \"feeling-food\" about ourselves because we fear, avoid, deny, reject and deflect most negatives in the world and ourselves from being acknowledged. We just want to believe \"it's all good\" and \"things are as they are supposed to be\", \"no need to do anything\", \"let it flow\", etc.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/denyingmistakesrepeatinglearn34678.jpg\" alt=\"denyingmistakesrepeatinglearn34678.jpg\" /></center>\n\nMany people are polarized against the negative and this hinders their accurate perception, conception, understanding and navigation of reality, leading them astray, wandering lost and fooling themselves into acting foolishly. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/mistakescorrectionfoolswisdom1c6a7.jpg\" alt=\"mistakescorrectionfoolswisdom1c6a7.jpg\" /></center>\n\n#### How do you empower yourself to change when a problem arises? How do you learn what the right and better thing to do is, that will fix and resolve the issue? You learn. You learn how to learn better, and you learn how to think better. Understanding of Knowledge is the Power to generate the Force of Will that can move you to Change.\n\n\n#### If you are not doing what needs to be done yet (or maybe you don't even know you are doing wrong), then maybe you *lack knowledge* and need to *learn more truth* in order to develop the *motivational power* to engage in the change that is required. Make mistakes, that's life, but learn from them.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/mistakesoncesecondtimeischoice3512e.jpg\" alt=\"mistakesoncesecondtimeischoice3512e.jpg\" /></center>\n\n#### Here are some methods of processing the issues, problems, situations and effects we encounter in reality in order to truly empower ourselves with knowledge and understanding, and finally to act wisely, instead of foolishly ignoring reality.\n\n----\n# Empowering Change - Break Free from the Shackles that Bind You from Progress\n\n### Free Will Choice to Care and be Empowered to Change Yourself and the World with Understanding *(why)* of Knowledge *(what)* to Act Wisely *(how)*\n\n1. Situation / Issue / Problem\n2. Empowered (Level I)\n3. Care, Courage, Choice & Will to Change\n4. Knowledge, Grammar, Input\n5. Understanding, Logic, Processing\n6. Empowered (Level II)\n7. More Will-Power & Wisdom, Rhetoric, Output\n8. Change in Your Life and the World!\n<br/>\n\n----\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/27/head-1597546_128065558.jpg\" alt=\"head-1597546_128065558.jpg\" border=\"0\"></center>\n## #1. Situation / Issue / Problem\n\nAcknowledge the issue.\n\nSee the uncomfortable, undesirable, painful truth as it is, and don't avoid, ignore, deny, reject or deflect it.\n\nRealize and recognize reality in its current condition. Face both the positive and negative, light and dark, beauty and horror, good and evil, moral and immoral, the truth of truth and the truth of falsity. \n\nHave the courage and care to look into the mirror and see the darkness, negative, \"demon\", shadow and wrongs that you may be involved in that you previously ignored being a part of.\n\nYou can do it. We all have this ability in consciousness. We can all start to see reality for what it is if we choose to let go of our fears and face the truth as it is.\n<br/>\n\n-----\n<center><a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/gjmbp\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/27/fist-681848_1280a5789.md.jpg\" alt=\"fist-681848_1280a5789.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></a></center>\n## #2. Empowered (Level I)\n\nFeel the empowerment to do something now that you faced the problem. Now you know about it, and that you have the power within you to do something to change the conditions around you. \n\n<br/>\n\n----\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/27/16332734480_81402c1818_zd14d0.jpg\" alt=\"16332734480_81402c1818_zd14d0.jpg\" border=\"0\"></center>\n## #3. Care, Courage, Choice & Will to Change\n\nChoosing to change and the drive to do it. \n\nYou know you can and need to learn more, and you can care more, and develop the courage to use your will-power to engage in deeper learning and thinking about yourself and reality.\n\nThe only way forward, is by overcoming the problem. You need to **Care** to do that. You need to have the **Courage** to want to do it. And then you need to engage in the **Will-Power** to do something about it.\n\nYou need **knowledge** and **understanding** to do the right change, and not the wrong change, or change ineffectively. Because that just means more mistakes, but you can always correct them too. The point is to take the time to learn properly so you can avoid making more mistakes.\n\nFeel the flame burning within, the care and courage feeding you. Time to collect some knowledge fuel and then ignite your potential to change the conditions in your life, and possibly, the world.\n\n<br/>\n\n----\n<center><a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/gjKN3\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/27/dementia-1528625_128009ee7.md.jpg\" alt=\"dementia-1528625_128009ee7.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></a></center>\n## #4. Knowledge, Grammar, Input\n\nCollect information and data on the situation. \n\nLearn about the problem in order to later understand the core foundational root causal factors that created it. You can only affect proper change of the problem, condition, situation or issue, when you deal with the root, not the leaves, when you deal with the actually cause, and not the effects that are symptoms of the cause. \n\n<center><img src=\"http://media.evolveconsciousness.org/2015/03/Causality-Base17-Wheel-of-Life-OG.png\" alt=\"Causality-Base17-Wheel-of-Life-OG\" /></center>\n\nCause and effect is a universal law that applies everywhere, even in human behavior and the human world and way of life we have created for ourselves.\n\n**What** is happening? Learn about the basics of the situation or problem. \n\nWhat, Who, When, Where. This is the basic **Knowledge** that needs to be gathered, collected and **Input**. This is also the **Grammar** phase in the [Trivium Methodology](http://triviummethod.org/).\n\nNow that you have figured out the basics of what's going on, you can progress to **Process** that information and **Understand** it.\n<br/>\n\n----\n<center><a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/gjOPu\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/27/Knowledge-sharingc795d.md.jpg\" alt=\"Knowledge-sharingc795d.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></a></center>\n## #5. Understanding, Logic, Processing\n\n**Process** the information to determine the root causal factors. This allows you to **Understand** with clarity of precision and higher definition detail. You now understand the meaning, purpose and value of the knowledge that will help to empower you to finally act to change the condition in reality.\n\n**Why** is this happening, really? Use *Logic* to remove contradiction, errors and filter the truth from the falsity.\n\nYou correspond and integrate all the information without contradiction. You validate it by filtering, discerning, judging , analyzing, diagnosing and evaluating the information. Take in quality truth as a foundation for making decisions.\n\n<center><img src=\"http://media.evolveconsciousness.org/2015/03/Causality-Base9.png\" alt=\"Logic\" /></center>\n\nGet down to the root of the issue, the real cause, and deal with it from the source. You now see and understand how the root causal core foundation is the reason for the secondary symptomatic effects to have manifested. There are thousands of effects that can be chased over and over, but until the common root is dealt with, it will continue to generate the same effects over and over. Stop applying band-aids and actually heal the wound.\n<br/>\n\n----\n<center><a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/gtJyE\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/27/love-1127710_1280d7f8d.md.jpg\" alt=\"love-1127710_1280d7f8d.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></a></center>\n## #6. Empowered (Level II)\n\nThe solution is understood from seeing the problem clearly, from gaining clarity. You're vision has been optimized.\n\nNow you're **REALLY** empowered to do something! You learned about the problem, got down to the root causal source of it, and now you understand what you need to do.\n\nFeel that **truth** flowing through you and giving you the energy to change. The fire and flame of **truth** is burning within and ignites you to **ACT**! Keep that care and courage going, and use the truth to ignite your actions.\n\n<br/>\n\n----\n<center><a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/gjflL\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/27/animal-483860_1280c5b94.md.jpg\" alt=\"animal-483860_1280c5b94.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></a></center>\n## #7. More Will-Power & Wisdom, Rhetoric, Output\n\nActualize, Realize, Generate and Manifest the Wisdom of Right-Action.\n\n**How** are you going to change what you do in order to resolve this situation, problem or issue?\n\nYou understand the root cause, and now you understand how to fix the problem. Target the **cause** that created the **effects** you don't want.\n\nThis can involved direct action, or speaking, teaching or preaching the truth of reality, or writing about it. These are all **Outputs** that are guided by the **Wisdom** of knowing what is the Right things to do. This is the 3rd phase in the Trivium Method, known as **Rhetoric**.\n\nUse the empowerment, care, courage and truth fuel to ignite your Will-Power and get things done. \n\nNow you are acting and doing something to get a change to occur. Even if it isn't instantaneous, you can act, and learn, and refine your understanding of what to do. This process can be applied over and over, and needs to be, continually.\n<br/>\n\n----\n<center><a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/gjjYS\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/27/Change-1080x67559547.md.jpg\" alt=\"Change-1080x67559547.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></a></center>\n## #8. Change in Your Life and the World!\n\nSee results manifest. \n\nMaybe there is more to do. We are always learning. That is life, to learn. If you stop learning, then you stop taking advantage of the power of your consciousness, and it goes to waste. Use that \"muscle\" and make it stronger as time goes by. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/corectmistakesmakenewversionofselfyangmingc44a9.jpg\" alt=\"corectmistakesmakenewversionofselfyangmingc44a9.jpg\" /></center>\n\nThis is the power we have. We can continually remake ourselves, continually self-renew and be reborn as a phoenix from the ashes. We can be malleable, highly adaptable, and wanting to change and evolve to higher heights. We can be the most fit for survival and optimizing our way of life. Become the change towards more moral truth, don't fight it.\n\n<center><img src=\"http://evolveconsciousness.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ego-phoenix-reborn.jpg\" alt=\"phoenix\" /></center>\n\nWhew! Done! Not so hard was it?\n\nTake a break, lay back and **reap** the rewards that you **sowed**. You earned it!\n\n-----\n*The next time you have an issue, or the next moment in your day you need to think about something, use this process. This is how we optimally process reality around us, and within us. This is the Trivium Methodology. Truth is truly empowering and you can change yourself and change your life!*\n\n*Learning is life. Learn how to learn better, and learn how to think better.*\n\nWe are all in this together in the end. The world is the way it is because we **ALL** make it this way. It's time we all step up and own our personal responsibility to do something about it. What we do matters. We can create more freedom, peace, prosperity and live in an anarchic (no masters, no slaves) way of life.\n\n-----\nWasn't that straightforward?

And to be honest (and disappointing to readers/whales and me as far as payouts go) I have found more than a few BIG Problems with Steem. Problems that if not addressed, will lead to its ultimate failure. Now, you might not agree with me (very likely) but they will.\nAnd I love Steem and I do think it is a few shorts changes short of being \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d!_\n#\n![steemit image](https://steemit.com/images/steemit-share.png)\n#\nOK that was the intro, now to the point\u2026\n#\n I consider [Why I Want to Short Steem  [Beyond Trading \u2013part2. 08/23/2016](https://steemit.com/steemit/@james-show/why-i-want-to-short-steem-beyond-trading-part2-08-23-2016) post of mine, the greatest insight in the Steem space, that I (and most writers that I have come across) ever got. \nI also totally understand why most of you will find the believes of mine expressed  there \u201cstupid\u201d \u201csilly\u201d \u201coutdated\u201d, but that take of yours does not makes them invalid or not true. Actually they are as true as when Adam Smith first thought of them\u2026.\n# Back to the present\u2026\nYes, I do __not__ believe; \u201cThe company\u2019s worth is what N million customers are worth to Facebook (or 100 times more in Steemit\u2019s case)\u201d,  especially when the company has NO CLUE how to monetize on those customers\u2026.\n#\n__And today this changed (maybe alittle, maybe alot [1]) by the introduction of \u201cpromoted posts\u201d__\nWith _promoted posts_ we can see how the system / all Steem power holders can benefit from someone trying to come to the system and pay his way in to all SP holders!\n#\nIt is a great new feature! The best in my humble opinion. The best I have seen from Steem really.\nAnd that\u2019s why I will _donate_ ( donate more or less really) a good sum of SD to put this (Badly written as far as English grammar and spelling go) post on that same list.\n-------\nOther (mostly less controversial posts of mine): \n1.

    "body": "**Currently, there are two ways to get a STEEM Account.** The first is to sign up for Steemit with a Reddit or Facebook account, the second is to create an account using CLI_WALLET or Piston and have the account **permanently linked to your own account.**\n\nNeither option really allows you to be anonymous. Want to post controversial posts, or say something that would otherwise be illegal in your country? (e.g. poor free speech laws) Then Anonsteem is here to help.\n\n## Introducing: @anonsteem\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y6QDDbD.png)\n\nPUBLIC INTERNET: [anon.steem.network](https://anon.steem.network/)\n----\n\nTOR: [steemlohs6air4h2.onion](http://steemlohs6air4h2.onion/)\n----\n\n----\n\n**So what actually is this?**\n\nAnonSteem allows you to purchase an account using either Bitcoin or Litecoin, and it will be created by the @anonsteem account within a minute of payment.\n\nTo protect your privacy, there are no IP logs, we have a TOR hidden service, and we allow you to remove your keys from our server as soon as you create the account.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4aa6tR7.png)\n\nWe give you detailed instructions on changing your keys after creating the account, so you can be sure we're not just going to steal your account later on.\n\nHow long does it take to get an account?\n-----\n\nTransactions are scanned once a minute, and we accept 0 confirmation transactions. This means you'll most likely have your account within 1-2 minutes of sending the payment, regardless of which coin you paid with.\n\nCan I pay with STEEM?\n----\n\nWe don't accept STEEM directly, as that would ruin your privacy. However, if you REALLY want to pay with STEEM, you can send it via [ShapeShift (precise mode)](https://shapeshift.io/#/inputs/2) to the BTC or LTC address you get during payment.\n\nDoesn't this service mean more spambots?\n----\n\nWe don't have any plans to allow en-masse account creation. Every order has to be placed one at a time, with individual payments. Someone looking to create spam bots would most likely look elsewhere.\n\nAnonsteem is targeted at persons or groups looking for one, or a few accounts, with no social media link, and no third party tracking.\n\n**HELP - my transaction expired?** - The 15 minute limit is just to avoid us checking transactions for abandoned orders. If you've already paid, just PM me on SteemitChat, or send me an email (bottom of the anonsteem page) with your order ID and I'll reset the expiry.\n\nTry it out at [anon.steem.network](https://anon.steem.network)\n----\n\nDo you like what I'm doing? Follow me, and [vote for @someguy123 to be a witness](https://steemit.com/~witnesses)\n====",

    "body": "http://www.steem101.com/facebooktest.jpg\n# My Facebook and Steemit experiment:\n### Two days ago @ around 8:00 am EST I posted an article about my little sweetheart named Jalyn.  She made \"Fall off the bone ribs\" and we documented her work with a video.\n\n### I then posted it on Steemit and Facebook at the exact same time.  \n*  Steemit: I had 68 followers at the time of the post.\n*  Facebook: I had 224 friends, family, coworkers at the time of the post.\n\n---\n\n## Here is a snapshot of both posts:\n\nSteemit Post:            |  FaceBook Post:\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](http://www.steem101.com/Steemit.jpg )  |  ![](http://www.steem101.com/facebook.jpg )\n\n\n\n| Steemit:  |    FaceBook    |  \n|----------|:-------------:|\n| 44 Up Votes |  7 Likes |\n| 4 Comments |    5 Comments  |\n| No Shares | 1 Share |\n| $84.66 | Zero - Cheap Bastards |\n\n## Summary:\nI thought it would be compelling to see how many votes I received with both Social Media Sites.  I found it very interesting that the number of Up Votes from the Steemit Community was more than 6 times the number of Likes from my Facebook Friends.  The reason I found this interesting is because I have 224 Facebook friends and I have known them a lot longer than my new friends at Steemit.  \n\nAnother interesting point is the fact I have been on Facebook for over 6 years.  I have been on Steemit for 2 months.   Looks like my Steemit Friends are more interested in what I have to share..... \n\nIt will also be interesting when I show my Facebook friends this little experiment.\nEspecially the part about the $84.66\n\n## Action:\nStop going to Facebook!\n\n#steemit #facebook #life #craigrant",

If every day, or every week this account (we\u2019ll be shifting to a new account shortly @advertise) be in the top five on the promo tab and you pay $3-5 you will reap the rewards of being on the top of SteemIt! Promote Post as a minnow is turning out to be a problem for [some](https://steemit.com/steemit/@profitgenerator/analysis-promoted-content) so the power of many seems more logical. \n\nAlso, going forward we\u2019ll be throwing the same amount daily/weekly, or even more toward the post reaching the top. As it stands $100 can get us all on the front page of SteemIt Promote. If 40 of us minnows throw in $5 for the day we can sit our submissions on top. Not only that **ALL SBD** that are earned by this post will go into \u201cpromote post\u201d itself thus helping you get free future advertising for your submissions! We\u2019ll be building out this post as we go as you can see we have a \u201cServices\u201d Category.\n\nIf you wish to get our upvote, just tag us with a SteemIt tag of **#upliftminnows** and we\u2019ll find your post. All proceeds of the post will go back to you so essentially you could have a free advertisement.\n<h2>How to Participate: </h2>\n\n<li>Simply, comment below with your story submission, or service and we\u2019ll add it to the page. Hit \u2018promote post\u2019 and send whatever amount you can and 'pool' it together with all other minnows. Put the $ amount you posted in your comment also. <b>Example: @joesmith $5 ( your link here )</b>.\n<br><br>\n<li>We will post the link you provide via a comment below to the post.\n<br><br>\n<li>The highest paying post will lead the list first and roll off the page after 20 entries.\n<br><br>\n<li>This post will last forever and each day/week a new post will be put up and  your listing could be carried over.\n<br><br>\n</li>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Note</strong> <br>\nFor this very first launch we are adding $50 to the pool. You may add as much as you want to this post, or as little as you want to get listed on <b>Uplift Minnows Initiative</b>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n \n<p><center><hr></center></p>\n <h2 id=\"steemit-story-submissions\"><center><strong>SteemIt Story Submissions:</strong></center></h2>\n<p><center><hr></center></p> \n\n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://payscape.com/wp-content/uploads/icon-globe-blue.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"></center><p></p>\n \n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ionicons/512/icon-arrow-right-b-128.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"><b><a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemtools/@kurtrohlandt/steemit-image-tools-pimp-your-posts\">SD- $6 | @kurtrohlandt: Steemit Image Tools - Pimp your posts</a></b></center><p></p>\n\n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ionicons/512/icon-arrow-right-b-128.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"><b><a href=\"https://steemit.com/steem/@williambanks/do-you-feel-taler-gnu-foundation-launches-their-own-cryptocoin\">SD- $5 | @williambanks: Do You Feel Taler? - GNU Foundation Launches Their Own Cryptocoin!</a></b></center><p></p>\n\n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ionicons/512/icon-arrow-right-b-128.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"><b><a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@michelle.gent/i-went-to-the-beach-and-i-cried\">SD- $5 | @michelle.gent: I went to the beach and I cried</a></b></center><p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ionicons/512/icon-arrow-right-b-128.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"><b><a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@me-tarzan/win-500-steempower-enter-steemit-daily-sweepstakes-100-winners-everyday\">SD- $2 | @me-tarzan: WIN !!!!! 500 !!!!!STEEMPOWER !!!!!.....

I am editor-in-chief of the Norwegian daily newspaper Aftenposten. I am writing this letter to inform you that I shall not comply with your requirement to remove a documentary photography from the Vietnam war made by Nick Ut.\n\nNot today, and not in the future.\n\nThe demand that we remove the picture came in an e-mail from Facebook\u2019s office in Hamburg this Wednesday morning. Less than 24 hours after the e-mail was sent, and before I had time to give my response, you intervened yourselves and deleted the article as well as the image from Aftenposten\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nTo be honest, I have no illusions that you will read this letter. The reason why I will still make this attempt, is that I am upset, disappointed \u2013 well, in fact even afraid - of what you are about to do to a mainstay of our democratic society.\n\nFirst some background. A few weeks ago the Norwegian author Tom Egeland posted an entry on Facebook about, and including, seven photographs that changed the history of warfare. You in turn removed the picture of a naked Kim Phuc, fleeing from the napalm bombs \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most famous war photographs.\n\nTom then rendered Kim Phuc\u2019s criticism against Facebook for banning her picture. Facebook reacted by excluding Tom and prevented him from posting a new entry.\n\n\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\n![](http://ap.mnocdn.no/images/fab84404-efd8-4651-97fb-23fc195b5abb?fit=crop&q=80&w=2048)\n<center><sup>Aftenposten's Editor-in-chief Espen Egil Hansen.</sup></center>\n</div>\nListen, Mark, this is serious. First you create rules that don\u2019t distinguish between child pornography and famous war photographs. Then you practice these rules without allowing space for good judgement. Finally you even censor criticism against and a discussion about the decision \u2013 and you punish the person who dares to voice criticism.\n\nFacebook is for the pleasure and benefit of the whole world, myself included, on a number of levels. I myself, for instance, keep in touch with my brothers via a closed group centered on our 89 year old father. Day by day we share joys and concerns.\n\nFacebook has become a world-leading platform for spreading information, for debate and for social contact between persons. You have gained this position because you deserve it.\n\nBut, dear Mark, you are the world\u2019s most powerful editor. Even for a major player like Aftenposten, Facebook is hard to avoid. In fact we don\u2019t really wish to avoid you, because you are offering us a great channel for distributing our content. We want to reach out with our journalism.\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\n\n![](http://ap.mnocdn.no/images/32183194-b955-4167-98b9-a598c510e45e?fit=crop&q=80&w=2048)\n<center><sup>Aftenposten's print front page Friday.</sup></center>\n</div>\n\nHowever, even though I am editor-in-chief of Norway\u2019s largest newspaper, I have to realize that you are restricting my room for exercising my editorial responsibility. This is what you and your subordinates are doing in this case.\n\nI think you are abusing your power, and I find it hard to believe that you have thought it through thoroughly.\n\nLet me return to the picture I mentioned by Nick Ut. The napalm-girl is by far the most iconic documentary photography from the Vietnam war. The media played a decisive role in reporting different stories about the war than the men in charge wanted them to publish. They brought about a change of attitude which played a role in ending the war. They contributed to a more open, more critical debate. This is how a democracy must function.\n\nThe free and independent media have an important task in bringing information, even including pictures, which sometimes may be unpleasant, and which the ruling elite and maybe even ordinary citizens cannot bear to see or hear, but which might be important precisely for that reason.\n\n\u00abIf liberty means anything at all, British George Orwell wrote in the preface to Animal Farm, \u00abit means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\u00bb\n\nThe media have a responsibility to consider publication in every single case. This may be a heavy responsibility. Each editor must weigh the pros and cons.\n\nThis right and duty, which all editors in the world have, should not be undermined by algorithms encoded in your office in California.\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\n\n![](http://ap.mnocdn.no/images/bf0bf779-a539-44ca-922f-939dc7b5e183?fit=crop&q=80&w=780)\n<center><sup>The original post on Aftenposten's Facebook page.</sup></center>\n</div>\n\nMark, please try to envision a new war where children will be the victims of barrel bombs or nerve gas. Would you once again intercept the documentation of cruelties, just because a tiny minority might possibly be offended by images of naked children, or because a paedophile person somewhere might see the picture as pornography?\n\nFacebook\u2019s Mission Statement states that your objective is to \u201cmake the world more open and connected\u201d.\n\nIn reality you are doing this in a totally superficial sense.\n\nIf you will not distinguish between child pornography and documentary photographs from a war, this will simply promote stupidity and fail to bring human beings closer to each other.\n\nTo pretend that it is possible to create common, global rules for what may and what may not be published, only throws dust into peoples\u2019 eyes.\n\nThe last decade has shown the extent to which unpredicatable and destructive things can happen when publication refuses to take into account the context.\n\nThe controversy over the Mohammad-caricatures, which flared in late 2005 and still remains a heated debate, had unknown consequences simply because the context and the original justification for publication were ignored.\n\nThe drawings were put into entirely new contexts, censured and condemned based on allegedly universal religious rules. This resulted in large demonstrations, violence and killings \u2013 and a remaining, potent threat against the freedom of speech. Some of the persons involved must still live with police protection.\n\nFacebook did not go global until this controversy had passed its peak. Your approach, Mark, might possibly have been to ban publication of Mohammad-drawings? If so, Facebook would in a stereotype way have stood on the side of the extreme religious forces, in opposition to the freedom of speech. You would have overruled the individual editor\u2019s assessment. Those of us who were in the centre of events at the time had to weigh the pros and cons day by day \u2013 and make decisions based on the reality we were in.\n\n![](http://ap.mnocdn.no/images/7c28467a-625c-4487-be16-a70f64e68247?fit=crop&q=80&w=2048)\n<sup>This is the message Aftenposten received from Facebook.</sup>\n\nIt was \u2013 and remains \u2013 different in Oslo and Karachi.\n\nThe controversy over the caricatures demonstrates just how impossible and illogical it is, trying to live with universal rules for publication in a time which is multi-religious, muli-cultural and multi-everything. Every human practice differs a lot as to geography, politics, social and economic conditions.\n\nThe least Facebook should do in order to be in harmony with its time is introduce geographically differentiated guidelines and rules for publication. Furthermore, Facebook should distinguish between editors and other Facebook-users. Editors cannot live with you, Mark, as a master editor.\n\nThese measures would still only soften the problems. If Facebook has other objectives than just being as big as possible and earn as much money as possible \u2013 and this I am still convinced that you have, Mark \u2013 you should undertake a comprehensive review of the way you operate.\n\nYou are a nice channel for persons who wish to share music videos, family dinners and other experiences. On this level you are bringing people closer to each other. But if you wish to increase the real understanding between human beings, you have to offer more liberty in order to meet the entire width of cultural expressions and discuss substantial matters.\n\nAnd then you have to be more accessible. Today, if it is possible at all to get in touch with a Facebook representative, the best one may hope for are brief, formalistic answers, with rigid references to universal rules and guidelines. If you take the liberty to challenge Facebook\u2019s rules, you will be met \u2013 as we have seen \u2013 with censorship. And if someone will protest against the censorship, he will be punished, as Tom Egeland was.\n\nI could have continued, Mark, but I have to stop at this point. I have written this letter to you because I am worried that the world\u2019s most important medium is limiting freedom in stead of trying to extend it, and that this occasionally happens in an authoritarian way. But I am also writing \u2013 and I hope you will understand this \u2013 because I take a positive attitude to the possibilities that Facebook has opened up. I only hope that you will utilize the possibilities in a better way.\n\nSincerely yours Espen Egil Hansen Editor-in-chief and CEO Aftenposten\n\nPS. I enclose a commentary from Aftenposten\u2019s 73 year old cartoonist Inge Gr\u00f8dum to the censorship practiced by Facebook. What does the algorithm say? Would it pass?",

Model is Rachelle Summers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/487e1d3949.jpeg\" width=\"350\" height=\"525\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/48875807ad.jpeg\" width=\"350\" height=\"525\"/></p>\n<p>This is \"Daydream\" from my <a href=\"https://steemit.com/art/@thecryptofiend/daydream-another-photo-post\">2nd post</a> (w. Rachelle Summers) and \"Oh the Horror!\" from <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@thecryptofiend/oh-the-horror-the-nostalgia-of-1980s-horror-movies-and-my-homage-to-them\">a post </a>a few days later (w.

    "body": "<html>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>In the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK there is an architectural oddity in the form of a large statue perched on one of the walls of the civic centre building. &nbsp;I have yet to find out what it represents but have heard people referring to it as \"Spiderman\" due to the way the figure is \"sitting\" on the wall. &nbsp;I suspect it probably represents some character from classical (Greco-Roman) mythology.</p>\n<p>These photos show a lot of detail and were taken using my IR converted Canon EOS 450D with EFS 18-200mm lens. &nbsp;In this case the IR shows certain details that would otherwise not be apparent in regular wavelengths of light.</p>\n<p>It gives it a a very high contrast \"graphic novel\" feel to the images which I feel is fitting. &nbsp;Unfortunately due to the position of the statue relative to the building I was limited in the different views and angles I could get of it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_013of5941bd.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_012of504160.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b1of1be4f1.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_014of5f221b.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_015of500c4b.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p>On some of the closer images you can see that the statue has no face. &nbsp;There is hair but the front part of the head &nbsp;is missing. &nbsp;Perhaps this is a clue to the identity?</p>\n<p>If you have any ideas please let me know. &nbsp;I hope you like the photos.</p>\n<p>If you like my work please follow me and check out my previous photography work and tutorials &nbsp;@thecryptofiend - hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Technical Information:</h1>\n<p>Canon EOS 450D with IR conversion</p>\n<p>Canon EF-S 18-200mm lens</p>\n<p>Adobe Lightroom CC and Nik Silver Effex Pro for processing.</p>\n<p>(Verification for me here: <a href=\"http://www.aapicture.com/about-me\">http://www.aapicture.com/about-me</a>)</p>\n</html>",

Just like with a tornado one house could be just fine while another is completely destroyed.  Same if you have a boat.  You could find what you think is the safest place and the waves and winds from a certain direction could still destroy it.\n\n* If you're living on a boat and can't get out of the way:\n   - Ask the locals the best place.  If there are other boat residents that have experience then ask them.  On St. John there were mangroves people would go into and tie on.  We didn't have time to get to the mangroves so we actually just anchored off our [Honeymoon beach](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Honeymoon+Beach/@18.3410287,-64.7928527,1049m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x8c0512650a0b6081:0x519a3aaf84902550!8m2!3d18.3400308!4d-64.7914364) with 4 anchors with duct tape to help prevent chaffing.  While boats in the harbors and other places were damaged ours just had just the wind vane blown off.\n  - Don't stay on board.  That was a crazy night that night and we took our marine radio with us and stayed in a cement building that night.  We heard constant calls for help from people on their boats saying that it broke lose and the Coast guard saying there was nothing they could do and to put on their life vests.  So scary.\n* If you're in a home:\n   - Board things up even if it is cat 1 because conditions can change fast.\n   - Make sure the roof is secure.\n   - If you're uncertain about your home then leave before the storm is close.\n   - If you happen to stay and as the storm is going over you can take some pressure out of the house by opening the opposite window.  The wind might change directions so be ready.\n   - If it gets really bad then go into the bathroom or another part of the house like a basement as long as there is no chance of flooding and protect yourself.\n* For everyone:\n   - Be sure to get money out.  With electricity out there are no services like ATM's or people taking credit cards or checks but stores might still be able to open for those with cash only.\n   - Of course lamps, battery operated radio and batteries.\n   - Food supplies, fresh water, propane tank with camp stovetop.  (While living in Puerto Rico we didn't have power for 2 months after [Hurricane George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Georges) which was a category 4).\n\nIf anyone else has any personal experience or you have added resources please leave a comment.",

A freedom advocate simply wants to be left alone to live his life in peace, without someone else trying to rule his actions with deadly force.</center>\n\n### <center>#2 What IS Wanted</center>\n\n<center>Voluntaryism: the belief that all human interactions should be based on mutual consent, entered into on a *voluntary basis.*</center>\n\n---\n\n## <center>Do What Works For You</center>\n\nHaving been among the community of amazing people who are advocates of self-ownership and true liberty for some time now, I have been exposed to all or most of the varied *conversational* approaches/techniques that are taken with people who are brand new to the discussion. \n\nThere are those that focus on the word **Voluntaryism (aka \"What do we WANT? Voluntary interaction!\")**. \nThere are those that focus on the word **Anarchy (aka \"What DON'T we want? A ruling class!\")**. \n\nThere are even those that try to ***avoid either term*** in conversation, and just stick to a slow and disarming **Socratic method**, taking the approach of curiosity towards the statist in conversation, aiming to understand why they believe what they believe (knowing that if the statist tries to describe it or defend it, they may see inconsistencies in themselves). \n\nAll of these ways of broaching the topic are truly valuable, because *each approach wins a certain kind of mind* that the other approaches might not have won.  \n\n---\n\n<center>https://s4.postimg.org/a97rr4759/static1_squarespace.jpg</center>\n\n## <center>The Consistent Human</center>\n\nI will mention another thought approach to the philosophy of liberty that I recently found myself considering, **though I'm sure it isn't *new*.**  It is too easy *not* to have been considered, but since I don't often see many people directing conversation in this manner, I will go ahead and throw up the idea for those who may make use of it.  \n\n{Note: I think some major liberty-minded philosophers have already put it rather similarly, a few Lysander Spooner quotes come to mind, but I can't remember more at the moment..}\n\nLet's say you're in a conversation that inevitably leads to someone asking you \"which way\" you lean, politically.  Some anarchists/voluntaryists *hate* when a conversation reaches this moment, some are *filled with glee!*\n\nHowever it's said, however the conversation gets there, you've now plunged into the realm of **politics** (every freedom lover *hates* politics), so you've got an opportunity to now to say something that will get their gears moving.\n\n<center>https://s4.postimg.org/713ae2kvh/images_1.jpg</center>\n\n### <center>Try this perhaps...</center> \n\nAvoiding the usual political circus jargon, and avoiding the false dichotomy of left vs. right, say something like: \n\n##### <center>\"I wouldn't align myself with anything political, but that's because I consider myself to be ***a consistent human being***.\"</center>\n\nBrows furrow, and you're likely to hear a \"What do you mean?\" sort of response.  \n\n##### <center>\"I believe it's wrong for me to steal, threaten people with deadly force, murder, or otherwise bully people who have a different life style than me.  And so I believe it's wrong for *any* human to do that: titles, election rituals, badges and costumes don't grant superhuman rights.  I apply the same rules of what I believe are right and wrong *to everyone.* I'm consistent.\"</center>\n\nOr, put another way, you could say: \n\n##### <center>\"If it's wrong for me to go put a gun to my neighbor's head and tell him to give me all his money or else, then it is wrong for me to *vote for someone else* to do that for me.  I recognize that no amount of voting or layers of hired government employees working to enforce the will of some humans on others, can ever make theft into something moral or good. I'm *consistent*.\"</center> \n\nAnd still another: \n\n##### <center>\"I don't want *my free will* violated, I will defend myself if someone tries to attack me or use the threat of force to steal from me, and so I am a *consistent human* by recognizing that same desire to live free exists in all individuals. It's 'doing unto others as I would have done to me', on the most basic level.\"</center>\n\n###### <center>Left, Right, Anarchy, Libertarian, Moderate... all the usual feels-inducing trigger words were side-stepped.</center>\n\n# <center>~*~</center>\n\n---\n\n<center>https://s4.postimg.org/9h53rx2y5/debate.jpg</center>\n\n# <center>Some Ideas Work Better Than Others, It Varies Person To Person</center> \n\nI encourage no one to get too caught up in the \"right way\" to go about spreading the message of true freedom-- so long as the principles are intact, and uncompromising.  Once you grasp the logic, there's many approaches to the discussion style, and what will work to wake up some will not work on others.  I'm not here to show you any one correct way, I would say to be flexible in your approach and style, and adjust when it seems there's a better approach to be taken.  \n\n### <center>Whether you're socratic, pedantic, abrasive, blunt, charismatic, diplomatic and gentle, or otherwise... some of that is going to work to reach people.  Part of your success in getting people to think is tied to how well you grasp human psychology.  A clue: It starts with \"know thyself\"..</center>\n\n## <center>~*~</center>\n\n<center>**Take from this article what you will, use what you can, discard the rest**.</center>",

height=\"424\"/></p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p><em><strong>On the 11th of January 2013, </strong></em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz\"><em><strong>Aaron Swartz</strong></em></a><em><strong>, a 26 year old internet activist was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment. &nbsp;He had been arrested 2 years earlier and was facing a variety of charges relating to downloading a large number of academic journal articles from an MIT server with the aim of making them available online for free.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Swartz was facing up to 50 years in prison on what seemed to be an extreme over-reaction to the actions of a young man who was trying to further the cause of the open access movement. &nbsp;It seems the stress of the situation and the aggression of the prosecution of this case caused the young man to take his own life.</p>\n<h3>This was all for the idealism of wanting open access to academic information much of which is publicly funded. &nbsp;He wanted a better world where scientific progress would not be hindered by the vested interests of publishing companies and unfortunately he payed for this \"great crime\" with his life.</h3>\n<p>Similar to what Swartz was attempting, Sci-Hub is an online archive in Russia that shares research articles from many journals freely. &nbsp;It currently hosts over 48 million articles and is being sued by publishing giant Elsevier for copyright infringement. &nbsp;Due to it's location it has been sheltered from the kind of legal sanctions it would face if it were located in the west. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The final outcome of the legal action against them is anyone's guess but it is likely that the full force of the US government will be used to try to stop them, much in the way it was used against Swartz.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Anyone who dares to challenge the vested interests in this case is likely to have war declared against them by nation states who are more concerned about protecting these interests than their own public or indeed the use of their own funds.</strong></em></p>\n<p>In this case it was the US government but most other Western governments would do exactly the same.</p>\n<h3>Copyright infringement is seemingly one of the worst crimes you can commit. &nbsp;The fact that much of this material was created using public money doesn't seem to matter to those that pursue the infringers.</h3>\n<p>In the rest of this article I hope to briefly cover why I feel that this is basically a form of war on Science and scientific progress itself.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>The Current Situation is a \"Racket\"</h1>\n<h1><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/33-1243179569caiVd09e6.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></h1>\n<p>2</p>\n<h1><em><strong>Three and a half years after Swartz' death we are still in a situation where the vast majority of scientific research is held captive behind pay walls. &nbsp;This is doubly scandalous given that a significant quantity of this research is publicly funded. &nbsp;</strong></em></h1>\n<p>The US alone spent about $158 billion on publicly funded research in 2013. &nbsp;The vast majority of this research was published in journals that require payment to be viewed.</p>\n<h3>Even if one doesn't believe that all research should be freely available why should research that is funded by the public be closed and require payment to be reviewed? &nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>This is equivalent to making the public pay twice for the same research. &nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><em>All the funds from payment go entirely to the journals. &nbsp;</em></h3>\n<p>None of it goes towards the researchers, authors or back to the public to fund further research. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The journals are effectively being given free material to publish which they then monetise purely for their own gain. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>They hold the copyright to all their published articles despite not being the original authors of them.</p>\n<h3>In what other situation can someone profit from selling and copyrighting a product which is made and tested almost entirely by others including the public itself?</h3>\n<p>It is complete insanity and it must stop.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Journals Have Costs But The Costs Are Inflated</h1>\n<p>Nobody is denying that the journals have costs but there are some misconceptions that relate to this. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Firstly the actual peer review process is carried out for free by academics (usually affiliated with Universities).&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>The journals themselves are only responsible for the costs of filtering submissions and the actual publication itself. &nbsp;These are known as APCs (Article Processing Charges). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>When paid journals have been compared in price to open journals the APCs an be as much as 3 times higher. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Further a large chunk of these costs comes from the physical publication process something which does not apply to online publication.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>The Scientific Method Depends on Openness</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/The_Scientific_Method_as_an_Ongoing_Process.svg8b9c6.png\" width=\"728\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>3</p>\n<h3>I won't bore you all by going into the details of the scientific method. &nbsp;The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method\">wikipedia article </a>here covers it quite well and the image above (by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:ArchonMagnus\">ArchonMagnus</a>) taken from it provides a nice summary of the basics. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>The \"other components section\" in the second part of the article is important here and I have summarised the headings here as they are pretty self-explanatory:</p>\n<p><em><strong>\"The scientific method also includes other components required even when all the iterations of the steps above have been completed:</strong></em></p>\n<ol>\n  <li><em><strong>Replication</strong></em></li>\n  <li><em><strong>External review</strong></em></li>\n  <li><em><strong>Data recording and sharing\"</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of the above components are necessary for real scientific progress. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We need replication to show that research findings are not spurious. &nbsp;External review is necessary to look for and exclude sources of error or poor research technique that the authors may have missed. &nbsp;Data recording and sharing is necessary for the same reason so that others can look at the raw data and perform their own analysis, looking for statistical anomalies etc.</p>\n<h3>This is all vital for the sustained and healthy progress of all scientific fields. &nbsp;Information must be open for true scientific progress to occur.</h3>\n<p>This lack of openness also leads to a slowing down of the scientific process. &nbsp;Papers are often delayed for months due to errors and rewrites. &nbsp;Many of these could be more quickly identified if papers are published in preliminary form online as pioneered by ArXiv.</p>\n<h3>The TLDR is that fighting open research is akin to declaring war on the scientific method itself. &nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>The result is a system which is slower, has more flaws and potentially even shuts down certain potential avenues of advancement.</h3>\n<h3><em>Whatever the journal publishers may say : &nbsp;</em><em><strong>paywalls = censorship</strong></em><em>.</em></h3>\n<hr />\n<h1>Grey Research and Another Type of Censorship</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/iStock_64854985_SMALL46da6.jpg\" width=\"759\" height=\"632\"/></p>\n<p>4</p>\n<h3>Further there is a lot of unpublished \"grey research\" - these are papers that have no findings or have negative findings. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>This kind of research is not considered \"sexy\" enough to be published by the major journals but from a purely scientific perspective it is just as important as the kind of studies that make headlines.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>This is a kind of soft censorship.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>At University I was shocked to see quite how much medical research in particular was consigned to archives where it would not see the light of day because it was not considered to be publishable. &nbsp;Not due to being improper research but because of just this sort of issue. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The failure to consider these kinds of studies leads to a significant skewing effect on the positive findings of those studies that do get published. &nbsp;The ultimate effect is that we do not get the big picture. &nbsp;This is particularly of concern in medical research where we only really see overtly positive studies.</h3>\n<p>Some research is also deliberately \"shelved\" if it doesn't agree with the agenda of one or more of the funding organisations. &nbsp;We have seen multiple scandals in relation to drug companies trying to hide certain research related to lucrative drugs as and side effects or adverse outcomes in the last couple of decades. &nbsp;Antidepressants and suicide risk is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/14/antidepressants-can-raise-the-risk-of-suicide-biggest-ever-revie/\">just one recent example</a>.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to say how many people may have died or been seriously harmed as a result of these kind of actions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>This is not a new thing and is more akin to a deliberate hard censorship. </strong></em>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>This is one of the reasons why I believe all research particularly that with public safety/health implications should be made public.</h3>\n<hr />\n<h1>Even Large Universities Can't Afford Access</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/Widener_Library_Harvard_University_Cambridge_MA6978c.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"408\"/></p>\n<p>5</p>\n<h3>In 2012 Havard University which is one of the worlds largest and wealthiest Universities announced that it could no longer continue affording to subscribe to all the journals which it had previously. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>They cited multiple increases in journal prices in the preceeding years as the reason. &nbsp;The vast majority of journals are owned by 3 major publishers who offer them in bundles - much like cable TV packages. &nbsp;Universities must negotiate prices for bundles and there is no set price. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The vast monopolies created by these companies mean that there is little competition to lower prices.</h3>\n<p>Prices have continued to increase despite the fact that the internet has substantially lowered the costs of publishing and disseminating information. &nbsp;From 1984 to 2002 alone the cost increased by 600%.</p>\n<h3>This is particularly ridiculous when some of the research that the Universities must pay for is research they themselves conducted!</h3>\n<p>If large Universities can't afford this then there is no way that smaller institutions or indeed individual scientists or members of the public can afford to.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>What is Open Access?</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/open-book-1378562978Vki3650a.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\"/></p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p>There are a number of slightly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access\">different definitions</a> but the basic thrust of it is contained in this excerpt from the Budapest Open Access Initiative in February 2002 relating to online access to academic journal articles:</p>\n<h3><em>\"There are many degrees and kinds of wider and easier access to this literature. By 'open access' to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.\"</em></h3>\n<p>This is what Swartz and many others in the open access community have been trying to achieve. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Sadly it seems the main thing holding open access back is&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The \"culture\" within the scientific community which falsely believes that paid journals are a necessity.&nbsp;</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>The vast lobbying power that the large consolidated multi-billion dollar publishing companies that own the big journals have which allows them to manipulate governments.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h1>Can Blockchains Help?</h1>\n<p>I am not a programmer or coder so I must apologise if I am incorrect in my understanding here. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>If a platform like Steemit can place large amounts of articles on a blockchain then I don't see why something similar could not be done for scientific research.</h3>\n<h3>The decentralised nature of a blockchain would prevent censorship by vested interests (publishers, drug companies etc.). &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>If a culture could be created where all research was placed on an academic blockchain like this as a basic prerequisite then both issues of access and lost research could be substantially reduced.</p>\n<p>As long as the blockchain remained in existence so would the research and all the associated data. &nbsp;Grey or hidden research could potentially be made a thing of the past.</p>\n<p>Anyone could access any research data anywhere in the world. &nbsp;It would require a lot of work and a lot of cultural change but I believe it to be feasible.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Some Signs of Hope</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_76511897_SMALL42a71.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>7</p>\n<p>There do appear to be some signs of change. &nbsp;Organisations such as PLoS (<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmlq-bpYDPAhWFCMAKHdbbD8oQFggeMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plos.org%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHD3YE-emOnoKJ8zjKDZ7ANvWFlIw&amp;sig2=a7_T5eyYCS8dC4UNNabgSw\">Public Library of Science</a>), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed_Central\">PubMed Central</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwignZCEqIDPAhVlLMAKHV7ZB8gQFggzMAM&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FArXiv&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtJ0miuq3iMwen_obEMJQsE-4XUw&amp;sig2=MMLyMay5noGlB6c7w6BbYA&amp;bvm=bv.131783435,d.ZGg\">ArXiv</a> have embraced the open access ethos. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>PLOS has a \"no questions asked\" waver for APCs to remove any financial barriers to publication. &nbsp;Some open access journals don't charge any fees at all.</p>\n<p>Governments have also tried to embrace change to some degree. &nbsp;For example the US National Institute for Health (NIH) which accounts for 50% of government funding aims to make all research which it funds publicly available within a year. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The major publishers had asked for a longer embargo so whilst the delay is not ideal it can be seen as a victory of sorts if a mixed one at that.</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Edit: @lemouth has also made me aware of the following iniative in the comments (his words):</strong></em></p>\n<p>\"First, about the <a href=\"https://scoap3.org/\">SCOAP3 initiative</a>.

    "body": "When we last saw our fearless captain and his android co-pilot, [they had reluctantly taken on a contract](https://steemit.com/fiction/@anarcho-andrei/the-stellar-wild-chapter-2) from a less-than-reputable contact in the government.  Read on and find out what happens to them next!\n\nUpvotes are appreciated, and let me know what you thought of the story so far in the comments!\n\n---------------\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/a0xXr4e.jpg</center>\n\n**She disliked wearing United Terran Systems Naval utility uniforms.**  She very rarely ever had to wear them - generally only when she was travelling with Marines as part of a military-intel joint operation - and she was thankful for that, so why she'd been told to put one on today was beyond her.  Functionally, they were serviceable; they had two chest pockets, a shoulder pocket on each upper arm, and a stay-flat collar that never popped up from the seam along the back of the collar.  The cargo pockets on the trousers were also lay-flat pockets, with a fair amount of expansion room.  The muted olive color reinforced the fact that these were utility uniforms.  Thankfully the female variants were cut closer at the waist; she'd only had to make due with a male variant once, and, despite being the proper size, it looked like she was wearing a green trash bag.\n\nTo take her mind off of it, she was reviewing her mission brief over and over again in her head.  It seemed simple enough: intercept the transport that they'd lost contact with, board it, and ascertain the state of its cargo.  If it was simply a communications issue, the crew would thank her and be on their way.  However, given the length of time they'd been in radio silence, it was likely the second scenario that she'd be dealing with: figure out what happened to the crew.  The internal surveillance logs would provide her that information.  Once the cargo was secured and transferred to the contractor ship the UTS had hired, they'd bring it back to Naval Intelligence Division's black site on the edge of the Nether, near to wear they had planned to deploy it in the first place.  Simple, straightforward, and a perfect assignment to spruce up her lieutenant commander's jacket for promotion, her commander had told her.\n\nAll of which made her wonder why in the hell they had opted for the cloak-and-dagger routine in the first place.  It wouldn't be the first time the UTSN had sent a detachment after a transport vessel broke contact.  Pirates were a constant problem in that part of the galaxy, so it was assumed that it would happen from time to time.  Granted, it happened near Kirauthi space, but she didn't see how that made a difference.  All the Monarchy ever did was rattle their saber at the Galactic Union about seceding because of this perceived slight or that aggressive action by the UTS.  If she could draw a historical parallel, North Korea's foreign relations with the United States in Earth's 21st century history was as perfect as any.  They complained, often and loudly, but they were quick to let it go once concessions were made.  They still controlled some of the most resource-rich mining planets in the Union, so the rest of the member organizations had to just grin and bear it.\n\n\"I'm sure these no-name contractors are going to be _consummate_ professionals, too,\" she muttered, staring out at the rain from under the covered loading area adjacent the landing pads.  She checked the holographic data assistant on her wrist.  They should be landing any minute, assuming they were on time.  Sure enough, as soon as she turned her eyes back to the cloud-covered skies above Krixus, the _Hound_ began to make its descent toward the landing pad she was standing nearest to.  _Curb-side service_, she mused, reaching down to grab her pack as the oblong, vaguely bullet-shaped cargo freighter landed on the slick asphalt.\n\nThe _Hound_ lurched forward as Cole cut the maneuvering thrusters, depositing the ship on its landing feet.  As was his custom, he gave it about five seconds before he unbuckled his harness and slid out of the captain's chair.  Edward shook his head and hit the switch to lower the boarding ramp behind them.  The way the ramp was set up made it exceptionally easy to run at full sprint into the ship from outside and land in the pilot's seat within two strides.  It was something both he and Edward had taken advantage of when bounties were less than willing to cooperate and happened to be heavily defended, too.\n\n\"You realize that, statistically speaking, if the landing arms were to fail, they would fail the moment that a load was placed on them,\" he remarked to Cole, unbuckling himself from his chair and standing up.  Cole scoffed.\n\n\"It never hurts to be safe about it; the _Hound's_ almost as old as you are, and it isn't nearly in as good a shape.  Now c'mon,\" he said, zipping up his worn leather jacket as he made his way down the ramp, \"we have a hefty payday just waiting to be collected.\"  Edward let out a sound approximating a sigh as he fell into step behind Cole, earning a look over the fearless captain's shoulder. \"I heard that, you.\"\n\nLieutenant Commander Miranda Rackham ducked her head down as she left the shelter of the extended awning, jogging briskly across the open ground that separated the UTSN forward post facility from the landing pad.  As she neared the _Hound_, she realized that it wasn't actually a cargo freighter; that's what those two that were making their way down the ramp used it for, no doubt, but really it was a decommissioned Chieftan-class corvette.  It had been modified, but the flight deck on the top and the underslung command deck were unmistakable.  _They took the last one out of service nearly a century ago,_ she mused, narrowing her eyes against the rain.  If she had some free time she'd have to find out what the original designation of this particular vessel was back when it was in service.\n\nCole came to a stop under the protective bulk of his ship, looking out at the figure hustling toward them across the asphalt.  He'd expected some pencil-necked, bespectacled kid who was barely strong enough to carry a daypack behind him.  Instead, he was presented with a fairly tall woman, her hair cut in a short bob, and a determined look on her face.  She had no name tape on her uniform, nor any rank insignia, so he had no idea how to address her, but he decided that this was going to be significantly more enjoyable than transporting some snot-nosed teenager.  Edward fell in beside him as he donned a smile.\n\n\"Good evening, ma'am.  My name is Joshua Cole and this is my co-pilot Edward.  We're going to be your ri-\" he started, before she abruptly cut him off, cutting her stride to a confident march.\n\n\"We need to be gear up in five minutes.  I'll stow my things in a spare bunk while you get underway,\" she replied curtly, walking past both of them and heading up the ramp with nothing less than utter disdain.  Cole just stood there for a second, blinking.  _Never been shot down that quick before,_ he thought.  Edward looked back over his shoulder to the ramp, then back to Cole.\n\n\"I like her,\" he remarked, his tone chipper and excited.  \"She's going to be great company on this trip.\"  He turned and walked back up the ramp before Cole could retort.  With a resigned sigh, he turned and made his way back up the ramp, punching the button to raise it as he settled back into the pilot chair, prepping the ship for take off.",

Right now, if you are not upvoted by a \u201cwhale\u201d account, it is very difficult to get exposure and any substantial rewards, which leads to many great authors leaving Steemit.</p>\n<p>Robin Hood wants to be the \u201cwhale\u201d that finds and helps a diverse set of talented, yet unrecognized authors. The proposed way of doing this is to cycle between different authors, upvoting ~10-20 quality posts daily. RHW won't upvote the same authors twice in any 10-day period in an effort to support more people and discourage any kind of abuse or ulterior motives.</p>\n<p>For RHW to have any meaningful impact, it must reach whale-status of SP and/or many bot followers. Yet, this is just the tip of the iceberg for this initiative. As featured authors and posts will be publicly announced periodically, we hope to inspire a movement that will lead &nbsp;to authors gaining fans, following and eventually to be able to self-sustain a blog on SteemIT without the RHW help at all.</p>\n<p>In a way, RHW's ultimate goal would be to not be needed at all. But as new enthusiastic authors join, RHW will be here to find them, help them and upvote them, growing the community and the overall quality of what you can find on Steemit.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>http://i.imgur.com/iu8Uf8b.png</p>\n<h2>Curators</h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a total of 10 official curators with a waiting list of other fellow Steemians. Curators are well known SteemIT individuals that dig through the vast amount of content to find hidden gems and undervalued authors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We would like to keep the curators list private for the time being, so they can continue working without interruptions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*Curators can publicly state they are part of Robin Hood at their sole discretion.*</p>\n<h2>Curation Process</h2>\n<p>Each curator discovers interesting content, including, but not limited to, the new section, steemviz, steemd, promotional channels on Steemit.chat and robinhood-links channel.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The author name is checked to ensure it\u2019s out of the 10-day cycle&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>The post is digested</li>\n  <li>The post is checked for plagiarism (with online tools and google)</li>\n  <li>The post is checked for Image sources and/or mention of own work</li>\n  <li>The images are run through online tools for reverse image search (if own work is mentioned)</li>\n  <li>If everything stated above is in check the link is submitted to the curator private chat</li>\n  <li>Other curators chime in if they agree or disagree and why</li>\n  <li>If agreed upon the post is upvoted by RHW, mentioned in general chat and listed in the official spreadsheet</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What's In It For Me?</p>\n<p>The more we elevate varied authors the larger the economy of Steemit gets. This benefits everyone since more members will have incentive to stick around. Satisfied members invite more friends if they themselves are successful. As an investor you get a percentage of your total contribution back as Steem each month.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>http://i.imgur.com/HGkOE5P.png</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Who Will Control The Keys?</h2>\n<p>A multi-signature system is currently being developed to add security and reassure investors that their funds are safe. The system will require two curators to sign off on an upvote, and more team members to agree on more sensitive actions.</p>\n<p>Currently the master key is held by @repholder, the backup master key by @kyriacos and the active key has been added to Streemian (owner - @xeroc).</p>\n<h2>Alpha Testing Results</h2>\n<p>Sample Dates : 20/08-28/08</p>\n<p>Sample Size : 78 Unique Authors&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Average payout : $134.48</p>\n<p>Issues Found: 2 - ID Theft/Plagiarism (which was unvoted) and a manual upvote mistake</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11UkN21t27uG9Fo_vRjX8lKasXOU0xIEL4AviCvlMMNw/edit#gid=0\">Spreadsheet of Alpha Testing Featured Authors</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@laonie\">Updates for users that are censored from Google services</a></p>\n<h2>How Can I Take Part ?</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Help find great authors and provide a link to their posts in #robinhood-links.</li>\n  <li>Connect to <a href=\"https://streemian.com/\">Streemian</a> and join the robinhoodwhale trail ( for invite codes contact @instructor2121 on steemit.chat). <em>Note:</em> Streemian uses the active key.</li>\n  <li>Use @lukestokes <a href=\"https://steemit.com/robinhoodwhale/@lukestokes/trusting-the-hive-mind-building-my-own-voting-bot-for-robinhoodwhale\">advanced bot guide</a>&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Provide your posting key to @laonie to add to his own RHW bot follower or use his <a href=\"https://steemit.com/robinhoodwhale/@laonie/how-to-set-up-your-own-voting-bot-for-robinhoodwhale\">setup voting bot guide</a></li>\n  <li>Invest in RHW by sending Steem, SD or Steem power to @robinhoodwhale</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Steemit.chat Channels</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.chat/channel/robinhood\">robinhood</a> - General discussion about the Robin Hood Whale initiative&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.chat/channel/robinhood-links\">robinhood-links</a> - These are posts to be considered by curators of the Robin Hood Whale initiative.

    "body": "A little while ago I wrote a [story](https://steemit.com/photography/@knircky/lion-hunting-zebras-and-being-chased-by-buffalo-in-the-masai-mara-afrika) of how the marsh pride of roughly 17 lions had killed a zebra. At the end Scarface showed up and feasted with the rest of the pride. He is the dominant male of a coalition of 3 males that rule several prides in the Masai Mara. He is also a bit of a celebrity. \n\nMe and my wife have been in the Mara for 3 nights now and today is our last day here. We have looked for the pride every day but could not find them again. We have seen one of the other males the day before. He was beautiful but his mane was not as dark as that of Scar. After our drive yesterday, we decided to get up and do one last game drive in the morning before catching our plane at 11 am which will take us to the Serengeti.\n\nWe will be rewarded for waking up early today by getting to see the king of the land one last time.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmYfPVJdAcuizxjj6ya3BZmiSSudpFriQ4Tkrq8tV1SuAc'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmYfPVJdAcuizxjj6ya3BZmiSSudpFriQ4Tkrq8tV1SuAc'/></a>\n\nIt is rainy season in east Africa right now, as it is April. We have experienced quite a bit of rain the last few days. The clouds and rains are different here from what I have ever seen. I think it is truly magnificent. My wife is not as enthusiastic and it was not always best for pictures. \n\nWe have also gotten stuck a few times, but our driver always managed to get unstuck without us having to shovel or call other rangers. His name is Benson and he is a true Masai that lives in a Masai village a short travel away from our camp. He is amazing and he loves this place. It is clearly his home and he has a deep connection with the land and many of the animals, such as Scar.\n\nHere is a view over the Mara with the rainy clouds from when we stopped for picnic the day before.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmSVsmBmQf7DrEzssrnA6y4G5DGcgdg8qPDLMtJQS3B7Zr'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmSVsmBmQf7DrEzssrnA6y4G5DGcgdg8qPDLMtJQS3B7Zr'/></a>\n\nThis morning we have been on the road for only a short time. All of a sudden Benson stops the car. He is speaking Masai on the walkie talkie and suddenly is turning around. We are going towards the edge of the Masai game park, where he is allowed to drive the range rover on the gras and off roads.\n\nWe have been here before, it is a huge wide open grassland with almost no trees that stretches towards the Mara river. At the river the landscape changes dramatically. It is bushy there and also forms the end of the game reserve. Our camp is on the other side of the river and it is outside the park. \n\nWe see some cars at a distance gathered around something. And there are hyenas everywhere. We have seen many hyenas the days before as they are truly the most successful predator and certainly the most abundant here. But I have never seen this many together. They are scattered over a large area and some are fighting and quarreling like they always seem to do.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/Qmc51FkjyrzktSrrJg1JqgDAX3TTon1XDHwGadMQhLMf2q'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/Qmc51FkjyrzktSrrJg1JqgDAX3TTon1XDHwGadMQhLMf2q'/></a>\n\nIt must be a very successful clan as usually hyenas live in groups around thirty. Today there are certainly more than 30 hyenas here. It looks more like the numbers are in the hundreds, although the biggest clans usually comprise around 80 members. They are scattered in a half-circle around where all the cars are parked and are running around anxiously.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmP7WoZkGZptyEkoosqyugxgeZjErfRYnAAxpKBZ14MhMF'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmP7WoZkGZptyEkoosqyugxgeZjErfRYnAAxpKBZ14MhMF'/></a>\n\nWe get to the where the other cars are and now see what the fuss is all about.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmfE8EM7REGqvTEe4sSu9qehQtb2TttYSWhnGGz3ktyCCt'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmfE8EM7REGqvTEe4sSu9qehQtb2TttYSWhnGGz3ktyCCt'/></a>\n\nIt is Scareface and what appears to be a dead hippo. Because Scarface is part of a coalition that control at least two prides, they often split up and travel back and forth between the two territories. Lions are known to patrol their lands while females tend to stay together forever and do not move quite as much.\n\nWhen we saw the females kill the zebra a few days before some people in the cars were talking about how male lions are lazy and rarely kill anything. \n\nBenson laughed at them. Clearly that is not the case. Around the dead hippo there is mud everywhere. A small circle of mud is around the carcass but there is a much bigger area where the grass has been replaced by wet black dirt. The struggle must have been enormous, quite different from the practical instant kill the lionesses have performed on the zebra. A hippo is probably quite a difficult animal to kill. I did not even know that these animals were on the lions menu.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmReNuJjduduswRJYwsmEwL9kF11gEScgJcgNK2V9NLHGv'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmReNuJjduduswRJYwsmEwL9kF11gEScgJcgNK2V9NLHGv'/></a>\n \nScarface is eating the intestines and the belly flesh of the hippo. He is clearly enjoying it. \nI ask Benson to move around to get different views of him. At one point we get a sniff of what was inside that belly. It stinks horribly bad. Benson quickly moves the car again so he does not have to smell it, while holding his nose closed. Quite a wuss for a former Masai warrior.\n\nWe are not the only ones watching the spectacle. There are many other photographers, tourists in range rovers and of course the hyenas are still lurking and quarreling. Either there are members of different clans around the kill or they are pre-negotiating the access to the hippos when Scar moves on. For a big lion this animal might appear huge but for all these hyenas it won't be enough.  \n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmdLpkhx9P4eG32CWyGDjUobVmutAnwuqNoxSj5xLyeDn1'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmdLpkhx9P4eG32CWyGDjUobVmutAnwuqNoxSj5xLyeDn1'/></a>\n\nThey still keep their distance. \n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmTchpqWxG4NqoMegWY6RAvxMxQARfKSTRH4kziqeKhuMr'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmTchpqWxG4NqoMegWY6RAvxMxQARfKSTRH4kziqeKhuMr'/></a>\n\nScar is not the least bit worried. He guards his kill and shows some minor sings of territorial behavior here and there, but mostly he just enjoys his kill and ignores everything else, like a true king would.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmbXJtziTZUY8fsVYFWJRBuBFwe11pVGwD6K1x7Q43VNs6'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmbXJtziTZUY8fsVYFWJRBuBFwe11pVGwD6K1x7Q43VNs6'/></a>\n\nHe must have been eating for a while as he seems to be getting full. There is only one feisty little jackal that comes very close. Scar seems not happy about it, but also too lazy to do much about it. Further back we see two other jackal fight for access to the scene.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmYmJ8xBavR6qTz18ww9LYrSvHbTdSKJPXcg5iqbmhTgVe'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmYmJ8xBavR6qTz18ww9LYrSvHbTdSKJPXcg5iqbmhTgVe'/></a>\n\nAfter a while Scar seems to have a full belly, as all he does now is look around. I wonder if he is looking for other members of his pride.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmcE8PUJtv3tUA7hFLwNrSsb7qc9MphYroSZDQ5U15niee'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmcE8PUJtv3tUA7hFLwNrSsb7qc9MphYroSZDQ5U15niee'/></a>\n\nShortly thereafter even that is too much work and he just lays sleepy in the mud. You can see on the edge of the picture there is a camp. That camp is outside of the park, that is how close we are to the edge of the park. This is also why the hyenas are not on the pictures with Scar. They are behind the cars coming from inside the park.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmZSRV6CYNEbLc4JEi2MaL7uuCphpSKkdGmVwDK1N5TACk'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmZSRV6CYNEbLc4JEi2MaL7uuCphpSKkdGmVwDK1N5TACk'/></a>\n\nEven though Scarface is laying flat on the ground now, the hyenas are still not coming closer. I cannot believe the respect this huge clan is showing to this one lion.\n\nWe do not stick around to the end and I do not know when Scarface will leave and if the hyenas get to finish off the hippo or if the rest of the marsh pride will show up after all.\n\nBenson wants to show us one other places and we drive on.\n\n\nBelow is also a video that tells the same story. I have made it particularly for steem and used an intro from @blockcore. I have tried something new by narrating over it in one take. Let me know if you like it.\n\nThe video is 5 minutes long.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f0h8E2QYrs\n\nAlso check out the other story of the march pride that features Scar as well https://steemit.com/photography/@knircky/lion-hunting-zebras-and-being-chased-by-buffalo-in-the-masai-mara-afrika\n\nIt also comes with a video of the whole event.\n\n\n\n### Pleas make sure to upvote and follow me [@knircky](http://steemit.com/photography/@knircky) if you like this story.\n\n## Thank you for your time and attention. \n\nI hope you enjoyed the story, the pictures and my video.\n\nThe pictures and video footage is all taken by me and my wife. She took the first picture of this set, where Scar looks directly at us. This is my favorite picture out of all the roughly 6000 pictures we took over the entire trip.\n\n#### ps. I am reposting this to see if there is an issue with this post or if it just wasn't noticed the first time. I also want to test the new promotion feature and see if that makes a difference.",

    "body": "![Group34d0c4.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/Group34d0c4.jpg)\n\n<br>\nThis is my partial* application for @ned's inaugural bounty, [for design and implementation of a Steemit bounty system](https://steemit.com/bounties/@ned/it-s-time-for-a-steem-bounty-system). \n\n*It's a partial application because designing a bounty system for Steemit is very complex (at least for a blockchain n00b like me). There are many different ways to implement this system. I feel like I need more collaboration with developers and the business to fully understand the technical constraints and business objectives. As @jesta said in his [post](https://steemit.com/bounty/@jesta/steem-bounty-system-milestone-1-proposal) yesterday:\n> TLDR: This project, done right, really isn't as simple as it sounds.\n\nAnyway, for now, the most valuable thing I can do to contribute is to post some lower fidelity (not polished) mobile web designs that outline my proposed Information Architecture (IA) and User Experience (UX). Once we can agree on the right content and feature set for the MVP version of Bounties, I'd like to polish the visual design and create desktop designs.\n\n## Assumptions and mechanics\nI agree with most of the mechanics outlined by @jesta in his [Steemit Bounty System proposal](https://steemit.com/bounty/@jesta/steem-bounty-system-milestone-1-proposal). If you haven't read it, please check it out. There are a few things that I want to challenge though:\n\n1. I think that the Bounty system should live within steemit.com (and not on a separate domain). There are pros and cons of this approach but I think keeping bounties native to the steemit.com ecosystem will create the most long term value due to it's ease of use for most non-advanced users. \n  \u2013 I propose that it lives at: http://steemit.com/bounties\n  \u2013 In case bounties are required to live on a separate domain for technical or legal reasons, perhaps it could live on the http://bounties.steemit.com subdomain. \n\n2. I'm leaning towards requiring bounty creators to be registered and logged into Steemit.com to post a new bounty.     \n\u2013 This would make posting a new bounty very similar to posting a new blog post. \n\u2013 It would also enable people to fund bounties using a similar mechanism to 'Promote a post' (instead of transferring funds to @bounty via steempay.io/shapeshift/cli_wallet commands as proposed by @jesta.\n\u2013 Requiring registration for bounty creators should increase the overall quality and reduce the potential for bounty abuse and misuse by increasing accountability and Steemit reputation transparency (like that outlined by @mrosenquist [here](https://steemit.com/bounty/@jesta/steem-bounty-system-milestone-1-proposal#@mrosenquist/re-jesta-steem-bounty-system-milestone-1-proposal-20160913t041449326z)) \n\n## Design ethos\n\nSince these designs are intended to live on Steemit.com, I've tried to adhere to Steemit's visual styles and retain it's interaction patterns for similar tasks. For example:\n  \u2013 Creating a bounty should be as easy and as similar as posting a blog post. \n  \u2013 Funding a bounty should be as easy and as similar as promoting a blog post. \n\n# Competitor analysis\n\nTo kick off the design process, I reviewed several comparable website earlier this week. Check it out here: \n\n[https://steemit.com/bounties/@pkattera/competitor-analysis-for-ned-s-proposed-bounty-management-system](https://steemit.com/bounties/@pkattera/competitor-analysis-for-ned-s-proposed-bounty-management-system)\n\n# Information Architecture \n\nHere's my proposed structure for the Bounties website:\n\n![Information-ArchitectureCopy2f439.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/Information-ArchitectureCopy2f439.jpg)\n\nAlthough I'd love to include a Bounty Hunter leaderboard and user profiles, I think we should keep the MVP as simple as possible for now and include it in a future version. \n\n# Content and features\n\nNow that I've outline the page templates and structure above, the Content Hierarchy diagram below shows a high level view of content and features to be included on each page. \n\n![Content77511.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/Content77511.jpg)\n\n# Mobile UX designs\n\nBelow are the mobile designs. Note: All copy, images and icons are placeholder for now.\n\n<br>\n## Bounties home / landing page\n\n![1.Bounty-home-page3de51.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/1.Bounty-home-page3de51.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Post a bounty (excluding milestones)\n\nAs per my previous post, adding milestones to bounties increases the complexity of the whole bounty system. \n> My gut feeling is to keep it super simple for version 1 and exclude milestones. People could still create individual bounties for separate tasks and link related bounties within the description.\n\nThis design excludes the concept of milestones. \n\n![2.Post-a-bounty4b820.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/2.Post-a-bounty4b820.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Post a bounty (including milestones)\n\nBut if people feel strongly about keeping milestones, here is a design. \n\n![Milestones78f61.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/Milestones78f61.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Bounty template\n\n![3a.Bounty-template-brief1aec2.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/3a.Bounty-template-brief1aec2.jpg)\n\n![3b.Bounty-template-submissions05700.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/3b.Bounty-template-submissions05700.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Submission template\n\n![4a-Submission6c0f1.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/4a-Submission6c0f1.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Submit work\n\n![4b.Submit-a-post81120.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/4b.Submit-a-post81120.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## My bounties\n\nA place to keep track of all the bounties that you've posted, entered, or watched.\n\n![5.My-bountiesf7ffb.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/5.My-bountiesf7ffb.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Filters on the bounty home / landing page\n\n![1a.filtersf0c90.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/1a.filtersf0c90.jpg)\n\n\n<br>\n---\n#### Questions or concerns?\n\nMessage me on steemit.chat (pkattera)\n\n<br>\n#### Thank you\n\nA few people to thank for inspiring me to design the Bounty System:\n\n\u2013 @ned for kicking off this initiative \n\u2013 @jesta for [this post](https://steemit.com/bounty/@jesta/steem-bounty-system-milestone-1-proposal)\n\u2013 @steve-walschot for [this post](https://steemit.com/bounty/@steve-walschot/application-for-bounty-system-by-ned)\n\u2013 @blueorgy for image hosting ([SteemIMG](https://www.steemimg.com/) gets better and better!) \n\n<br>\n#### Acknowledgements \n\nI used a few icons from The [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Hey steemit,</p>\n<p>Ths is the start of my novel Zero Zone, which takes place in a world where the ozone layer is shrinking every year. But as it is shrinking at a different rate each year, no one knows how much longer they have. The story starts when plane travel is coming to an end, and people have decided where they want to spend their last years. I'm hoping to release the novel here exclusively for six months and start a kickstarter campaign, but that will depend on interest.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who is checking it out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/6mw4j2fap/cloud_cover_1005177_640.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"425\"/>t</p>\n<p>Chapter 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sandra jolted forward as the plane skid across the landing. &nbsp;All that kept her in was her seat belt, which twisted and dug into her skin.. &nbsp;It would hurt later, after the fear had subsided. &nbsp;Beside her a large gentleman grabbed the breathing apparatus that dangled before him. &nbsp;Deep breaths. &nbsp;Sandra closed her eyes as the plane came to a complete spot. &nbsp;She chuckled to herself as a thought came to her. &nbsp;To die on the last plane that would ever leave the ground. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Sandra asked the man beside her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He took another deep breath with closed eyes. &nbsp;Then, opening them, nodded. &nbsp;Sandra returned the nod with a smile before placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. His breathing slowed. &nbsp;He nodded again, slower. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The speaker crackled above her, \u201cThis is pilot Edward Tarp. &nbsp;You have safely landed in Toronto, Canada. &nbsp;Thank you for flying with us. &nbsp;I have been flying planes for my whole life and wanted to say it has been an honour. &nbsp;Thank you.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A person in the back started to clap. &nbsp;Then another. &nbsp;Before long, everyone started to cheer. &nbsp;A burst of emotion flooded the plane. &nbsp;Some people couldn\u2019t stop crying. &nbsp;Sandra politely clapped her hands a few times before getting up to grab her luggage. &nbsp;She had already shed her tears. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With her luggage in hand, Sandra entered the airport. &nbsp;Everything looked normal still. &nbsp;Take a snapshot of a random group of people anywhere in the planet and it was like it was before things started to change. &nbsp;But then talk to those people. &nbsp;One quit his job and is following his dream. &nbsp;A couple can't muster the strength to get out of bed. &nbsp;While a woman is trading up on her addictions, looking to avoid any shred of reality. &nbsp;Everyone grieves differently. &nbsp;Sandra just didn't want to be alone. &nbsp;Now that air travel was no longer an option, people had to quickly decide who it was the wanted to spend their last couple of years with. &nbsp;Sandra chose Greg. &nbsp;She wasn't stuck. &nbsp;There was boats. &nbsp;Ways to return home. &nbsp;Back to Ryan. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;She made her decision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Sandra!\u201d &nbsp;A bearded man in his late twenties waved his hands in the air. &nbsp;He had on a muscle shirt and long shorts. &nbsp;He rushed towards Sandra. &nbsp;Without warning, &nbsp;he picked her up and spun her around the airport for all to see. &nbsp;Then he put her down to admire her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d she asked &nbsp;Greg fixed his glasses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, you know for the world ending and everything.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were never one to let just trivial things ruin your mood.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Greg smiled and winked. &nbsp;He took out a rolled joint and placed it in his mouth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI know Canada is relaxed Greg, but we are still in an airport.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Greg finished lighting. &nbsp;He took a drag. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cAirport security isn't what it used to be. &nbsp;They still give a shit in England?\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Greg started to walk to his car. &nbsp;Sandra followed behind him, carrying her own luggage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, it's worse. &nbsp;They are cracking down. &nbsp;Trying to keep things civil. &nbsp;Normal. &nbsp;I even got a ticket &nbsp;for littering the other day.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg laughed. &nbsp;\u201cWhat a joke. &nbsp;Always so fucking proper. &nbsp;Even doomsday can wait until tea time is finished. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Greg started to sing a brit punk song about anarchy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cStill signing I see.\u201d &nbsp;Sandra placed her bags in the back seat of a convertible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah the band has been booked non-stop. &nbsp;Nobody wants quiet anymore.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Greg took another dragged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cOr sobriety.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cHey I was stoned way before I found out we were all going to die. &nbsp;Everyone else is a poser.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before Greg could take another hit, Sandra took the blunt from his mouth and placed it in hers. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cCan at you at least get us home before you get fucked up?\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cHome... I like that.\u201d &nbsp;Greg revved up the engine. &nbsp;Music blasted from the speakers. &nbsp;Sandra let it hit her as she sunk in the seat. &nbsp;With a deep breath she let the smoke fill her lungs.</p>\n<p>Chapter 2</p>\n<p>Sandra woke up with a headache. &nbsp;She hasn't partied like this in years. &nbsp;Around here empty bottles of vodka and gin decorated the loft. &nbsp;A full ashtray. &nbsp;Getting up, slowly, she stretched her body. &nbsp;Draping her body with an over-sized robe, Sandra grabbed her cell phone. &nbsp;She double checked to make sure Greg was still passed out before sneaking out the sliding door that lead to the beach. &nbsp;A slight breeze rushed against her face. &nbsp;It was warm out for a January night. &nbsp;But that was normal now. &nbsp;Winters were like summers. &nbsp;And the summers... &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sandra waited as the phone rang. &nbsp;Thomas answered on the third ring. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cHello.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cHey stranger.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSandra, is that you? &nbsp;It's four in the morning.\u201d &nbsp;\u201c</p>\n<p>We both knew you would be up.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thomas laughed. &nbsp;\u201cTrue... but what about you?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cCan't sleep.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A beat. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was the flight?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, until we almost crashed on landing.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Thomas asked. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Yeah.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cTo die on the last plane ride.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sandra smiled, \u201cI thought the same thing... so... how goes the research? &nbsp;Have you saved the world yet?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cYou probably would have heard something if I did.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cHas there been any progress?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thomas let out a sigh. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThomas?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cNo Sandra. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;We can't even figure out at what rate the ozone layer is shrinking, let alone what is causing it. &nbsp;Some months it's a lot, some months it's barely noticeable.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long do we have?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSome people saw five, some say ten. &nbsp;No one knows.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cAnd you're still determined to spend them in a lab?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yep, I will die with a beaker in my hand.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sandra smiled. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Silence. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d said Thomas. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't... please don't.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, you didn't give me a chance to say it before you left.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI gave you plenty of chances, maybe if you looked at me once, you would have seen that I was tired of &nbsp;waiting.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I suppose to apologize because of what is happening?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI was waiting for you long before this happened.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still blame me. &nbsp;You were with Greg.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah and you were with Linda... and they were out of the picture for six months. &nbsp;One of them wasn't even in the country.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were BOTH busy then Sandra. &nbsp;Remember, you didn't want to get involved, to mess up our friendship while things were hectic. &nbsp;You just started your job at the hospital. &nbsp;Or did you forget about all that?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least I still made time to see you. &nbsp;And no I didn't forget. &nbsp;Don't shove that in my face\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you're practising medicine out there in Toronto? &nbsp;Making a difference.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck you Thomas. &nbsp;On your high horse. &nbsp;You work for one person, you, to keep your mind busy, not all of us can find escape like that, so don't make us feel like shit.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn't mean to...\u201d Thomas swallowed hard, \u201cI'm just mad Sandra. &nbsp;You left so suddenly. &nbsp;So permanently. &nbsp;And to Greg. &nbsp;Of all people. &nbsp;This isn't the worse part of it I know. &nbsp;It would have been just as bad if you were alone. &nbsp;But still...\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you it makes you feel better, he didn't win, you lost.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, I feel so much better now.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sandra. &nbsp;\u201cAnd I miss you too.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cLet's try to keep in touch. &nbsp;I don't know how much longer our phones will work.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThe satellites, didn't you hear?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah we are heading back to the stone age... you don't know about the boats either?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sandra stared off into the distant sea. &nbsp;\u201cBoats?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cCommercial ships are stopping at the end of February. &nbsp;Too dangerous with the weather.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's not too late you know... you can come home.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI can't do that to Greg.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cHe would probably be too high to remember it.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm sorry Thomas.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWas worth a shoot.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI should go...\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand. &nbsp;We will talk soon.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah... we will... bye Thomas.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A tear started to slide down Sandra's cheek. &nbsp;She let herself feel the wind brush against it before wiping it off. &nbsp;Then she turned around to go back to bed. &nbsp;But before she left the beach something caught her eye. &nbsp;There was a man with a camera pointed towards the sky, over the water. &nbsp;Sandra wandered over to get closer. &nbsp;When she was a couple of feet away she looked up to see what he was looking at. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;It was pitch black. &nbsp;But then the sun started to rise. &nbsp;Magnificent shades of red and orange illuminated the air. &nbsp;It was like being under a blanket of fire. &nbsp;Sandra watched on in awe as the sound of a clicking camera went off beside her. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this the first sunset you have seen since it started.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, still looking at the sky. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThey get more beautiful each day. &nbsp;As the sun gets closer.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThe sun isn't getting closer.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, but it's easier to say that. &nbsp;People spend too much time trying to explain things.\u201d &nbsp;He took another couple of shots. &nbsp;\u201cI've been getting a lot of great shots. &nbsp;Of people too. &nbsp;It's like a magnifying glass. &nbsp;We are still who we are, just now exposed. &nbsp;Maybe intensified is the better word. &nbsp;So much emotion.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's too bad...\u201d &nbsp;Sandra stopped what she was saying. &nbsp;It didn't need to be said: too bad no one will see them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The photographer looked at Sandra. &nbsp;He gave her a slight nod and went back to taking photos. &nbsp;\u201cIt won't hurt.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThe sun... when the ozone layer can't protect us anymore and the sun engulfs us. &nbsp;It won't hurt.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sandra just stared back. &nbsp;Her hands started to shake. &nbsp;Light at first, but then. &nbsp;She rushed back into the house and flung open the cabinet doors. &nbsp;With force she moved things around and through pots out of her way. &nbsp;The sound echoed through the loft. &nbsp;Greg woke up. &nbsp;He walked up behind Sandra who was rustling through the entire kitchen. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSandra?\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI need a drink.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cCome back to bed.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sandra turned and looked at Greg. &nbsp;&nbsp;\u201cI need a fucking drink.\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Greg moved over to his closet and pulled out a half empty bottle of vodka. &nbsp;Sandra took it and chugged it back. &nbsp;She almost finished it before gasping for air. &nbsp;Then she shrunk to the floor, balling up as tight as she could. &nbsp;Greg wrapped his arms around her. &nbsp;Tears. &nbsp;It was going to be a long night.</p>\n</html>",

Once it reaches the present moment, it will keep going, printing events with every new block (every 3 seconds or so).\n\nThe output will look a little bit like this:\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HPhjgyp.png)\n\n**Operation Types:**\nPerhaps we aren't interested in all the events, but just specific ones.\nWe can ask `replay` to only give us **votes**:\n```\nfor event in Blockchain().replay(filter_by=\"vote\")\n```\nOr a set of events, such as **votes and comments**:\n```\nfor event in Blockchain().replay(filter_by=[\"vote\", \"comment\"])\n```\n\nFor the reference, the full list of currently available operations is:\n```\nblockchain_operations = [\n    'vote', 'comment', 'delete_comment', 'account_create', 'account_update',\n    'limit_order_create', 'limit_order_cancel',\n    'transfer',  'transfer_to_vesting', 'withdraw_vesting', 'convert', 'set_withdraw_vesting_route',\n    'pow', 'pow2', 'feed_publish',  'witness_update',\n    'account_witness_vote', 'account_witness_proxy',\n    'recover_account', 'request_account_recovery', 'change_recovery_account',\n    'custom', 'custom_json'\n]\n```\n\n**Time Constraints:**\nParsing the ENTIRE blockchain is often unnecessary. We can specify a desired range:\n```\nstart_block = 3598980\nend_block = 4260042\nfor event in Blockchain().replay(start_block, end_block=end_block, filter_by=[\"vote\", \"comment\"]):\n\tpprint(event)\n```\n\nWorking with block numbers is painful, and this is why `blockchain` module comes with 2 helpers:\n```\nget_current_block()\nget_block_from_time(\"2016-09-01T00:00:00\")\n```\n\n**Putting it all together...**\n```\nb = Blockchain()\nhistory = b.replay(\n    start_block=b.get_block_from_time(\"2016-09-01T00:00:00\"),\n    end_block=b.get_current_block(),\n    filter_by=['transfer']\n)\nfor event in history:\n    payment = event['op']\n    print(\"@%s sent %s to @%s\" % (payment['from'], payment['amount'], payment['to']))\n```\nThe above code will fetch all the transfers from September 9th going forward, up until present.\n```\n...\n@victoriart sent 1.000 SBD to @null\n@dude sent 5.095 STEEM to @bittrex\n@devil sent 5.107 STEEM to @poloniex\n@pinoytravel sent 0.010 SBD to @null\n@aladdin sent 5.013 STEEM to @poloniex\n@mrwang sent 31.211 STEEM to @blocktrades\n@kodi sent 0.030 SBD to @steembingo\n...\n```\n\n## Account History\n-----------------\nAccount module allows us to lookup virtual operations, as well as some of the common operations for an individual account.\nUsually it is more efficient to query the account history over parsing the blockchain block-by-block.\n\n\n**Looking up the account history:**\nAccounts module gives us 2 generators for the task, **history**, which gives us account history from inception forward and **history2** which gives us account history newest to oldest. The interface should look familiar, as it is similar to the **replay** from the *blockchain* module.\n```\nfrom steemtools.base import Account\nfrom steemtools.helpers import parse_payout\n\nfor event in Account(\"furion\").history(filter_by=[\"transfer\"]):\n    transfer = event['op']\n    if transfer['to'] == \"null\":\n        print(\"$%.1f :: %s\" % (parse_payout(transfer['amount']), transfer['memo']))\n```\nThe code above will pull the transfer history for my account, find promoted posts by looking for transfers to @null, and finally print the $ amount spent as well as the permlink to the post.\n\n```\n$11.1 :: @furion/steem-analysis-ownership-distribution-and-the-whale-selling-pressure\n$11.0 :: @furion/using-machine-learning-to-fight-plagiarism\n$41.0 :: @furion/a-quick-look-at-null-and-the-profitability-of-promoted-posts\n```\n\n**Virtual Operations:**\nAs mentioned above, there are several operations that are *virtual*, and we cannot obtain these by parsing the blockchain itself. We can however lookup the history of virtual operations on a specific account with the **history** method.\n```\nAccount(\"furion\").history(filter_by=[\"curate_reward\", \"fill_order\"])\n```\nCurrently, the following types are available for the lookup (both virtual and not):\n```\naccount_operations = {\n    'account_create',\n    'account_update',\n    'account_witness_vote',\n    'comment',\n    'comment_reward',\n    'convert',\n    'curate_reward',\n    'fill_order',\n    'fill_vesting_withdraw',\n    'fill_convert_request',\n    'interest',\n    'limit_order_cancel',\n    'limit_order_create',\n    'transfer',\n    'transfer_to_vesting',\n    'vote',\n    'witness_update',\n    'account_witness_proxy',\n    'feed_publish',\n    'pow', 'pow2',\n    'withdraw_vesting',\n}\n```\n\n## Account Methods\n-----------------\nAccount has several helper methods. Here are a few:\n```\nfrom steemtools.base import Account\n\naccount = Account(\"furion\")\n\naccount.get_sp()\n#> 6211.590278675119\n\naccount.reputation()\n#> 62.76\n\naccount.voting_power()\n#> 80.75\n\naccount.avg_payout_per_post()\n#> 142.7166\n```\n\nWe can also easily obtain the latest blog posts. Lets get the titles of most recent 3:\n```\nblog = account.get_blog()\nfor post in blog[:3]:\n\tprint(post['title'])\n\n# outputs:\n# A quick look at @null, and the profitability of Promoted Posts\n# A quick look at the top curators and their rewards\n# Homepage Payout Distribution, Power Law and Project Curie\n\n```\nHow about a list of followers:\n```\nfollowers = account.get_followers()\n#> ['anns', 'benjy33', 'negoshi', ...]\n\n```\n\nLets obtain the curation stats:\n```\naccount.curation_stats()\n# outputs\n# {'24hr': 9.627790750805277, '7d': 57.82547153222017, 'avg': 8.260781647460025}\n```\n\nOr get a basket of features:\n```\naccount.get_features(max_posts, payout_requirement)\n```\n\nOutputs:\n```\n{'author': {'followers': 281,\n  'post_count': 10,\n  'ppp': 142,\n  'rep': 62.76,\n  'sp': 6211,\n  'ttw': 281.0,\n  'winners': 2},\n 'name': 'furion',\n 'settings': {'max_posts': 10, 'payout_requirement': 300}}\n ```\n Check out the `base.py` module for all the methods.\n\n## Posts\n-----------------\nPost is a superset of `piston.steem.Post`. This means that, it behaves the same way, and has all the niceties and helpers that piston's Post object has.\n\nWe can initialize it in any of these ways:\na) using the identifier string\n```\nPost(\"@furion/homepage-payout-distribution-power-law-and-project-curie\")\n```\n\nb) using a piston.steem.Post object\n```\nlast_post = Account(\"furion\").get_blog()[0]\nPost(last_post)\n```\n\nc) using a author+permlink containing dictionary, such as vote\n```\nfor vote in s.rpc.stream(\"vote\"):\n        print(vote)\n        print(Post(vote))\n        \n# {'voter': 'ats-david', 'author': 'whatsup', 'weight': 10000, 'permlink': 're-steve-walschot-investigating-the-wale-scam-assumptions-above-knowledge-20160912t020220232z'}\n# <Steem.Post-@whatsup/re-steve-walschot-investigating-the-wale-scam-assumptions-above-knowledge-20160912t020220232z>\n```\n\n----------\nNow that our Post is initialized, we have access to extra methods. Here are a few:\n```\np = Post(\"@furion/homepage-payout-distribution-power-law-and-project-curie\")\n\np.payout()\n#> 456.003\n\n# if the post was 10 minutes old, this would output 33.33\np.calc_reward_pct()\n#> 100\n\np.is_comment()\n#> False\n\n# not a spam tagged post\np.contains_tags(filter_by=[\"spam\"])\n#> False\n\np.get_votes()\n#> [list of active votes]\n\n```\nCheck out the `base.py` module for all the methods.\n\n\n## Converter\n-----------------\nConverter is a class that tries to convert/calculate different units. I won't go into details in this post, aside from listing the available methods:\n```\nfrom steemtools.base import Converter\n\nc = Converter()\n\nc.sbd_median_price()\nc.steem_per_mvests()\n\nc.vests_to_sp(vests)\nc.sp_to_vests(sp)\nc.sp_to_rshares(sp)\nc.steem_to_sbd(steem)\nc.sbd_to_steem(sbd)\nc.sbd_to_shares(sbd)\nc.rshares_to_weight(rshares)\n```\n\n## Helpers\n-----------------\nHelpers is a set of static methods that are generally useful when dealing with Steem objects.\n```\nfrom steemtools import helpers\n\n# get just the digit part of any asset (STEEM, VESTS, SBD)\nhelpers.parse_payout(\"12.3456 SBD\") \n#> 12.3456\n\n# break down our asset\nhelpers.read_asset(\"12.3456 SBD\")\n#> {'symbol': 'SBD', 'value': 12.3456}\n\n# get time difference in seconds between lets say 2 posts\nhelpers.time_diff(time1, time2)\n#> 1337\n\n# determine if our object is a post or a comment\nhelpers.is_comment(object)\n#> False\n\n# time elapsed in seconds \nhelpers.time_elapsed(post)\n#> 9001\n```\n\n\n## Going forward\nI wanted to be as minimal as possible with the first version, and only include the most essential components.\n\nThere are many new features, and areas in which steemtools can be expanded upon. For instance, an exchange module, that would allow for quick bootstrapping of a market-maker or arbitrage bot. These features may be added later on.\n\nFor now, I am looking for feedback and new ideas on how to improve whats already there, and make the library stable, so people can depend on it.\n\nGithub: [Netherdrake/steemtools](https://github.com/Netherdrake/steemtools)\n\n-------------------\n\n<center>![](http://i.imgur.com/5MaAhy7.png)  Don't miss out on the next post.

And what's more, because of it generates a lot of evil in the world today. So what kind of problem is it? Let's find out.\n\nNo matter who you are - believer or atheist, you've probably heard about the seven deadly sins:\n\n* Lust\n* Greed\n* Gluttony\n* Envy \n* Wrath\n* Pride\n* Sloth\n\nAnd you know, someone will agree with me, someone will judge and that's fine, because people are different, but I do not see much of a problem, and really deadly sins. I see human emotions, which is likely was felt by every person in his life.\n\n>\u0421\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f \u044f \u0431\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043e\u0431 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0438\u0445, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044f \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044e, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430. \u0412 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438 \u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e. \u0418 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u043b\u0430, \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435. \u0427\u0442\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430? \u0414\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043c.\n\n>\u041d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u044b \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u0442\u0435\u0438\u0441\u0442, \u0432\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043e \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u0440\u0435\u0445\u0430\u0445:\n\n>* \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c\n>* \u0430\u043b\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\n>* \u0447\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0435\n>* \u0417\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044c\n>* \u0433\u043d\u0435\u0432\n>* \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0434\u044b\u043d\u044f\n>* \u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c (\u0443\u043d\u044b\u043d\u0438\u0435)\n\n>\u0418 \u0432\u044b \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435, \u043a\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u043a\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0436\u0443 \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0432. \u042f \u0432\u0438\u0436\u0443 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435, \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a.\n\n<br />\n\nhttp://eleveneight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-7-Deadly-Sins-Of-Social-Media-New-Blog.png\n<a href=\"http://eleveneight.co.uk/7-deadly-sins-of-social-media/\">image credit</a>\n\n<br />\n\n---\n\nHaving gone through many extreme situations, I am hold the opinion that the main problem of mankind - indifference.\n\nOne such situation:\n\nWalked past the tram station on which stood about 20 people. I saw a man lying on the rails... but all of these 20 people just stood and waited for the tram. Of course I went up to this man. Very strong smell of alcohol was from he and he was sleeping. I examined him for signs of damage (anything can happen), in appearance all was well with him. So, i tried to wake him up, i did not succeed. He certainly showed signs of life and even tried to open his eyes, but alcohol in blood was very much, he could not even say anything. So I just pulled him of the tram paths and put it in a safe place. And no one helped me. But when i finished, i heard that in the crowd began to talk about what I did right thing and what would happen if I did not. That is, all these people are not even thinking about it before, they're like a zombie, just doing something for which came to a stop - waiting for the tram.\n\nAs Mother Teresa said:\n> The greatest sin of a man is not the hatred, but indifference to his brothers.\n\nI added this saying, by my thoughts. Indifference - sin, vice, bad character trait, bad parenting... call it what you want. Indifference is the problem! And problem is not only in indifference to people, like Mother Teresa said. Anyone who watches calm, although he could help as the animal dies, just as calmly pass by a person who needs help.\n\nAnd if people were not be indifferent, then didn't happen many terrible things. Just ask yourself how many times you have seen something strange, wrong. Maybe girl in a side street, to which molested drunk guys, or an old man who could not cross the road, because no one was stops... maybe worth to come and help?! But perhaps it is not my business! Maybe girl familiar with them, and maybe they're just fooling around. Maybe this old man does not want to cross the road, and just waiting for someone. It would be nice if everything in life came to good end, but life is cruel! Not helped the old man, thought it was not your business, and in the morning saw on the news that he was hit by a car or read about a girl who was raped in nearby alley.\n\n>\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0432 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435

March 1964. She was murdered and raped and several neighbors heard her cry but no one helped her. After this incident, for the study of this issue were took psychologists and studies have been conducted. The result was revealed the so-called \"bystander effect\", proving that the greater the number of people present at the crime, the less likely that someone will help.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\n* The bystander effect, or bystander apathy, is a social psychological phenomenon that refers to cases in which individuals do not offer any means of help to a victim when other people are present. The probability of help is inversely related to the number of bystanders. In other words, the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. Several variables help to explain why the bystander effect occurs.\n\n\n\n>\u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0430\u0438\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435

    "body": "# Life is unfair.. and it's okay.\n\nSome people will have better luck and fortune than others. Nothing will ever stop that. Life is unfair. - **We all know it**. However, people also tend to discuss the fairness of steemit. - I've done it myself too so I know what I'm talking about.\n\n<center>http://cdn.h3sean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Unfair.png</center>\n<center>[Source](http://h3sean.com/god-unfair/)</center>\n\n> *\"Steemit is unfair.\"*\n\nBut.. Is it really unfair? - **I don't know. Perhaps. Probably.**\n\nHave you ever gambled on a casino? In real life or online doesn't matter.\n\n**- I bet some of you've done that.**\n\nHave you ever played a computer game, a card game or have you ever played monopoly with your family, friends or against other people?\n\n**- I bet most of you have done that.**\n\n<center>http://blogs.lasprovincias.es/elsindromededarrin/files/2016/07/o-MONOPOLY-facebook-1.jpg</center>\n<center>[Source](http://blogs.lasprovincias.es/elsindromededarrin/)</center>\n\n### The follow-up questions are..\n- Did you win? - Did you win every single time you played? - Are you the best there is at the game?\n\nI bet most of you would love to answer **yes** on these questions but in reality, most of you would lie if you did that. - You didn't win everytime and you're probably not the best player ever at these games. - **Is that unfair?**\n\n- It's life. It's bound to happen. You'll never be able to win everytime you play a game against others. At some point you'll meet someone who's better than you. A person with more skills. A person with more knowledge, experience or a person who've trained more than you. A person with more luck.\n\nYou will lose that game.. **And that's okay.**\n\n---\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/bYmdHcX.gif</center>\n<center>[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1ubutj/the_power_of_mike_tyson_in_his_prime/)</center>\n\n### With that being said..\nIf I tried to fight Mike Tyson or Muhammad Ali, in the past, during their glory days.. I would probably end up dead. I don't have the fighting skills it takes to bring down such monstrous beasts.\n\nSo.. **How can I expect to get a ton of rewards on Steemit with every single post of mine?** - It's impossible.. Or is it..?\n\nWhat you count as *\"a ton of reward\"* would obviously play a major role in this so let's say anything between $100 and $300+. That would be 1 or 2 whales. On each post. **Roughly estimated.**\n\nI've told you this before. I had never owned a bitcoin before I joined steemit. I don't consider myself to be *\"the lucky guy\"*, but I'm not unlucky either. **I believe I deserve what I've made so far.**\n\nI share content, I try to promote steemit and I try to help others and all that.. I contribute. More on that later in this post.\n\n---\n\n<center>http://www.worldmomsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ID-10086141.jpg</center>\n<center>[source](http://www.worldmomsnetwork.com/2013/10/30/egypt-can-life/)</center>\n\nAnyhow, I never owned a bitcoin before I joined steemit... **So I wouldn't call myself a bitcoin expert would I?** - Especially since there's thousands of other people here with more knowledge than me. People who are true experts. I leave that subject where it is. **In the hands of the real experts**. In the hands of people who understand what it's all about. People who know every single detail about it.\n\n### So, what can I do? - And what should I post?\n\nFirst of all, I would give myself some time and think about this entire community we have here. What can I do for steemit? - What can I do for you? - **What can I bring to the table?**\n\nDo I have something that others lack? - Am I better at something than others..?\n\n- **In my case I would say no**. I never compare myself with others like that. I find it stupid.. And I would probably only hurt myself if I did.\n\n## Why do I even mention this then..?\n\n<center>http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-y0CGvDsBGMI/UszG2RE2SkI/AAAAAAAACWk/_5DP51zVdwM/s1600/standinginyourway.png</center>\n<center>[Source](http://quotesgram.com/your-own-worst-enemy-quotes/)</center>\n\n- Because **time** and **thoughts** is what will give you an upper hand. **An upper hand against yourself.**\n\nYou are your biggest hinder. On steemit and in life. You are the one standing in front of the treasure but you lack the courage to grab it. I've been there too and it's okay. - **As long as you are aware of it.**\n\nYou are your own enemy so don't spend time comparing yourself with others.. **Don't get more enemies.**\n\n---\n\n## Moving on..\n\nYou should always publish content you want to share. Things you believe in, things you like. What you truly want to share. Not what you think others would like. That's a pretty common sentence these days. I've said it myself too a bunch of times already.. **So why do I bring it up once more?**\n\nI don't know you in person. I don't know what type of person you are or what you can or cannot do.. But I do know that there's an endless ocean of people out there (perhaps not on steemit alone) who doesn't know what to write.. Even though they know that they should publish content they like to share!\n\n**And why is that?**\n\n- The main reason for this is that some people aren't aware of the things they are good at.\n\nThey know but they would never answer a question with that.\n\n---\n\n### I'll give you an example of this:\n\nImagine a job interview. Some people are nervous so they shake and others are filled with confidence.\n\n<center>http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1937498/original.jpg</center>\n<center>[Source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/30/hunger-entitlement-study_n_5631594.html)</center>\n\nSuddenly the question comes..\n\n- **What are your qualities as a person?**\n\nor\n\n- **Why should we hire you instead of someone else?**\n\nAny of these two questions means instant death to some people. **They don't know how to answer that.**\n\nThey know that they are a great parent, amazing artists or very skilled football players.. But they don't mention that during the interview or as answers for these questions because it doesn't *\"fit\"*.\n\nThe job is for a grocery store or as a salesperson, literally anything that doesn't *\"fit\"* your category.. So to be a great football player or a good artist doesn't count.. Right? - **Wrong.**\n\n<center>http://cyrusevanado.s3.amazonaws.com/ai/selfmarketing/images/shoppingdude.jpg</center>\n<center>[Source](http://cyrusevanado.s3.amazonaws.com/ai/selfmarketing/index.html)</center>\n\n## A great answer is more important than \"the answer\".\n\nWhat do I mean by that? - **Take a look at this:**\n\n- **What are your qualities as a person?**\n\n> *\"I am a humble person with a burning desire to build a family, raising two beautiful kids, driving a SUV and take my kids to Disneyland. I would love to see my kids with that super-smile on their face when they hug Mickey Mouse. That's who I am. Do you have kids?\"*\n\n- **Why should we hire you instead of someone else?**\n\n> *\"I've always loved to share my creations as an artist with the people around me. I'm hardworking and I've been freelancing full time for 5 years now.\"*\n\n**Now your face probably looks like this:**\n\n<center>https://static4.fjcdn.com/comments/What+face+_78d9aaf81a6f9b7902ca1ee371b90428.png</center>\n<center>[Source](https://funnyjunk.com/channel/feels/We+all+know+that+feel/XsvvGKf/6)</center>\n\nAnd yeah, I can understand why.. This was confusing for me too when I first encountered this.. But let me break this down for you even further..\n\n**What did I accomplish with these answers? - None of them are actually *\"related\"* to the questions, right?**\n\n- **In the first answer I actually tell them this:**\n\n> I am humble person, a good listener and I'm willing to help others.. I am a dreamer and I will work hard to get there. I will bring my A game at all times.\n\n- That's not at all the things I said, but that's how most people will interpret it. Having a family, raising kids and having dreams about vacations, smiles and a SUV. **That speaks for itself.** That means you're willing to push yourself to get there. You also touch their hearts with this. You go deep. You go to a personal level.\n\n**In my second answer, I tell them this:**\n\n> I care about others. I help others and I feel good about it. I work hard no matter what's at stake and I always deliver. I've delivered for 5 years already and I won't stop now.\n\n- Again, this isn't near the things I said.. But between the lines, this is a perfect match of what I gave as an answer. You share your creations which basically means that you care about others and that's important no matter what you'll work with. You've also been working full time for the past 5 years, so you are filled with confidence, know-how and you're still alive.. **So that means that you know what you're doing.**\n\n---\n\n### Most people would answer these questions like this:\n\n> My name is ______ and I'm ___ years old. I live ______ and I'm interested in this job. I previously worked at ________. I am honest, loyal and trustworthy. I am a nice person if you asked my friends.\n\nAnd sure, this isn't bad.. But it's the same type of answer they got a billion times before.. - Hopefully, you understand my point with this. - Use your talents. Think about it. **You have much more than you are able to see!**\n\n<center>http://img12.deviantart.net/62ed/i/2011/140/d/6/be_you_wallpaper__grey_by_lileviljess-d3gs5ts.jpg</center>\n<center>[Source](http://lileviljess.deviantart.com/art/Be-You-Wallpaper-Grey-209586304)</center>\n\n---\n\nShare what you are. Share the things you are good at. Share things you've done and things you do.. **Be you.** - That's what will bring you the most rewards in the long run. Especially on a personal level.\n\n<center>**Be the best you can be.**</center>\n\n---\n\n### What do I do..?\n\nI share things I care about. I share things from my personal life. I share things I feel good about.\n\nI also share *\"Hidden Photography Gems\"*. - None of them have reached high rewards.. I've also just recently launched a special contest. A \"secret contest\" and I've even sent the winner the prize money. I earned 1.8 STEEM POWER and lost $27 SBD in total doing that.. - **And I'm truly glad I did what I did.**\n\nI do this to help others. I do this to bring value, faith and happiness to steemit. It's not much but it's something. Hopefully I can encourage people. I can't change a person's life with my votes or with $27 SBD but I can make a huge difference with my words. I can spread the word as much as possible and hopefully, at some point, someone will pick that up.. **And that's the chance we're looking for!** \n\n<center>**That's the chance I want to give to all of us.**</center>\n\nWhen I feature people's posts I always wish that they will receive comments and upvotes, I would love to see that. On each and everyone of the posts I feature.. I will continue to spread my word and publish authors from the photography section because I feel that the photography section deserves much more attention.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it will get more attention in a month or a year automatically when more users have joined steemit.. I want to be part of this. I want to spread the word. I want to help. - **And I will continue to do that.**\n\n<center>**I do this because I feel good about it .. And in return, I help you. In one way or another.**</center>\n\n<center>http://www.sirenconsultingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/something-better-than-nothing.jpg</center>\n<center>[Source](http://www.sirenconsultingfirm.com/in-marketing-something-is-better-than-nothing/)</center>\n\n---\n\n<center>[**Feel Free To Follow Me**](https://steemit.com/@hitmeasap)</center>\n\n---",

    "body": "Some people are still confused as to what a witness is. There's a lot of mixed information on Steemit as to what a witness does, and how much they earn.\n\nI'm here to clear this up with a thorough post, with simple explanations where possible.\n\n## What is a witness?\n\n**A witness plays a crucial part in how the STEEM network functions. Some people might not be aware of this, but Steemit is just a fancy web interface on top of a large network called STEEM, which operates remotely similar to Bitcoin.**\n\nSimple Definition:\n\n>A STEEM witness is a person whom operates a **witness server** (which produces blocks), and publishes a price feed of STEEM/USD to the network.\n\nWitnesses have many tasks. **The first and foremost is to produce blocks (thus process transactions)**, the second most important is to produce a price feed, which is how STEEM Dollars are always worth 1 US Dollar in STEEM (using the 7 day exchange).\n\nYou may have heard of the term **51% attack** before. Unlike Bitcoin, miners don't matter much to the STEEM network, instead, that is a witnesses job: \n\n**A hard fork happens when 67% of the top witnesses are all running a certain version of STEEM**, which means the top 19 witnesses can pick and choose whether to agree with a fork or not. (e.g. Hard Fork 13 and 14 were both postponed for a week, and re-designed because witnesses refused to update)\n\nTl;Dr\n\n - They're the main producer of blocks (not miners)\n - They maintain a price feed, which is how SBD functions\n - They play the role of consensus (decide whether to hard fork or not)\n - Many witnesses, such as myself, @riverhead, @roadscape @jesta and @arhag work on important things to help the STEEM network function and grow\n - Some witnesses don't produce any content, or work on anything STEEM related, e.g. @gtg - however, they are sometimes highly focused witnesses, who are very reliable (gtg has only missed 2 blocks after running for months)\n\n## Why should I care?\n\nA witness is paid proportionally to how high they are in the witness ranks, excluding the top 19 witnesses (who get 1 block every ~63 seconds).\n\nBut how do they get to those ranks? **They get voted in, by people like YOU**. It's just like an election, **if you don't vote, other people may vote in witnesses who are malicious or simply unreliable.**\n\n@thecryptofiend has came up with a questionnaire for witnesses, which may help people decide on who to vote for: https://steemit.com/steemit/@thecryptofiend/witness-questionnaire-a-solution-for-voter-confusion\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ldf0VnV.png)\n<center>Witness voting page</center>\n\nYou can see the witness ranks, and vote for witnesses at https://steemit.com/~witnesses\n\n## How are blocks created/scheduled?\n\nIt's not a very even mixture as you would hope. Blocks are produced in \"rounds\", which are 21 blocks long, and blocks are created every 3 seconds.\n\nDuring each 21 block round, the blocks are distributed as such:\n\n - 19 blocks go to the top 19 voted witnesses (who are slightly shuffled to avoid witnesses purposely skipping blocks)\n - 1 block goes to a Proof-of-Work miner, who becomes a witness for just 1 block.\n - 1 semi-random witness outside of the top 19, which is influenced by their ranking\n\nYou can read more about the witness scheduling (it's very complicated!) in this article by Steemit CTO @dantheman :\n\nhttps://steemit.com/steem/@dantheman/steem-witness-scheduling-algorithm\n\n## How often do they get blocks (how much do they earn)?\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, witnesses are paid proportional to their rank in the system. A witness at rank 30 can produce as many as 4 blocks/hour, compared to a witness at rank 50, which may produce less than 1 block/hour.\n\n**A STEEM block is worth 1 STEEM Power (not STEEM, or SBD), which means all rewards for miners/witnesses are trickle-paid for 2 years.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OaOiNlf.png)\n<center>[@someguy123 on SteemDB](https://steemdb.com/@someguy123)</center>\n\nIn my current position, 39, I create between 2 to 3 blocks per hour. `(2 * 24) * 31 = 1488` - that's approximately 1,500 STEEM Power per month at rank 39.\n\n### But what about the top 19? What do they get?\n\nThe top 19 witnesses get 1 block each, per 21 block round. This means they get approximately 1 block per 63 seconds.\n\nPer day they get roughly 1400 SP\n\n```(60 * 60 * 24) / 63 = 1,371.42```\n\nPer month they get roughly 42,500 SP\n\n```(60 * 60 * 24 * 31) / 63 = 42,514.28```\n\nAnd per year they get roughly 510,000 SP\n\n```(60 * 60 * 24 * 31 * 12) / 63 = 510,171.42```\n\n## Can anyone become a witness?\n\nThe short answer is: Yes.\n\nBecoming a witness requires several things:\n\n - A powerful (and reliable) server to run a witness server on\n - A second powerful server, with good bandwidth - to operate a Steem Seed (similar to a Bitcoin full node, distributes blocks)\n - Creating a **signing key**, and then broadcasting your intent to become a witness from `cli_wallet`\n - An accurate price feed of STEEM/USD which is updated *at least* once per day\n - Technical capabilities - you should understand most STEEM concepts, and be able to deal with server problems quickly\n - Trust from the community that you would be a good candidate for a witness\n\nSome of these steps are optional (e.g. the seed), while others might not matter until you approach the top 19 (the price feed) however, they're all very strongly recommended if you want to succeed as a witness.\n\n------\n\nI will be posting an in-depth tutorial on setting up a witness soon, as many of the existing articles lack important details. Until then, if you want to set up a witness, I recommend joining `#witness` on [STEEMIT.CHAT](https://steemit.chat) and asking for up to date guidance.\n\n------\n\n\n---\n\nDo you like what I'm doing for STEEM/Steemit?\n----\n[Vote for me to be a witness](https://steemit.com/~witnesses) - every vote counts. \n----\nDon't forget to follow me for more like this.\n----",

I don't want to see some viagra commercial in my app!\n### Touch\u00e9. But here's the businessmodel behind it:\n\n- Only ads linking to a **steemit post** will be allowed.\n- Only a small text banner on the top will be allowed. No images, only text.\n- No forced clicks or upvotes; The user will only **see** the ad.\n- Every ad needs to have **approval** before being listed.\n- First come, first served system.\n- Visibility and duration will be announced later.\n\n----\n## Note that ads will only be visible for users who create an account trough our app. Existing users will be completely ad-free.\n----\n# General progress\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/819S9aW.jpg\n\nThe overall developement is inline with our expectations., the first public android version will be online by the end of next week.\n\nCurrently the code is about 90% completed, so is the UI design ([see this showcase](https://steemit.com/steempay/@cass/steempay-io-mobile-payment-solution-ui-ux-playground) ) by @cass.\n\nMake sure to [follow me](https://steemit.com/@steve-walschot) to stay updated.\n\nIf you want to support Steempay.io, consider giving me a [witness vote](https://steemit.com/witness-category/@steve-walschot/witness-application-post-steve-walschot-creator-of-steempay).\n\n# Steem on!",

    "body": "### Good food is happy freedom\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CbwrsfB5-g\n\n### Every day is the same day repeating itself, just as 1 second of now.\n\n### Inequality is having to get permission or give apology.\n\n### JOY is my force field.\n\n---\n\nOn the way to the sushi restaurant...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2gmGK3ftOY\n\n---\n\n## Craig Grant in 1999\nI no longer had the financial support of my girlfriend, and things slowed down for me with music. I had now admitted to myself that I had failed at becoming famous hip hop star and was ready to go back to school. I moved back to my mothers house and cut myself off from most of my music friends. I started night classes at Palm Beach Community college. I hated it. I continued to work with my rap group ACU to complete their album, but stopped with everything after that. Julie was working in a salon and would occasionally come to visit me. We talked allot on the phone at night while I worked delivering pizza. She had some cute girlfriends and I always asked her to hook me up. Our long phone conversations would often venture into sexual subjects. Julie(Yuliana's nick name) had a girlfriend that was bisexual, she often spent the night at Julie\u2019s house and they would pretend to be messing with each other while I was on the phone. One night me and a friend named Mr. Menace picked up Julie and her bisexual friend to hang out. We went to my mothers house and all got drunk. They were scared to have sex with us, but we convinced them to let us watch them. They did a little bit, not much. I was pleased to see Julie in just her panties for the first time. I was so drunk and started talking about my childhood for a long time.\n\nI was desperate to find a way out of my mothers house and out of school. I started thinking maybe now it\u2019s time to find a rich old woman, my last resort to wealth. Early in the year I found a flier advertising Unlimited long distance for a flat rate of $59 per month. I could tell this was a new company and new technology, and I wanted to get involved. The company was International Communications Corporation from Boca Raton, Fl. I called them and asked if there was a away I could make $$ promoting their service. They signed me up as a reseller making $25 per new customer plus 10% of the recurring phone bill. I made fliers and advertised the service in the local news paper. I made a web site called LongDistanceFlat.com that was programmed to sign up new customers online. At first my web site collected the customer information, then I would print and fax the order. When I started the service was only available locally, but the company grew fast and then it was available nationwide. I started learning how to promote my web site online to get more customers. I started getting checks in the mail. I was happy to be making $$ this way. It took allot of work but I was working for myself without a boss on my back and making my own hours, I liked it. I spent all the $$ I made delivering pizza on promoting LongDistanceFlat.com.\n\nIn August my daily routine was to deliver pizza and get on the Internet, I quit school. My mother was concerned. One Saturday night she yelled at me to get out the house and go party, she was all dressed up to go out. She said I was spending too much time on that dam computer. I told her \u201cThis is going to pay off\u201d. My only friends in this time was Lesmes and Julie. Me and Lesmes were doing music, and Julie would visit about 3 times per week. I started showing her all the cool stuff I am doing online and how I am making $$ with it. I also showed her a personal ad I had on excite.com to find a girlfriend. I had a few responses and went on a couple dates, but nothing good. Julie put a personal ad in excite.com just for the fun of it, she got hundreds of responses in just 2 days, it was overwhelming. She read the messages and laughed. She brought a very sexy friend to my house once, her name was Sophie. Julie started looking better now that she had been working in the salon, she also had a nice car, a red convertible Mustang.\n\nWhile promoting LongDistanceFlat.com I started a promotion offering a free cordless phone to new customers. Free stuff offers got allot of attention online, and it was easy to get links on free stuff sites for my offer. I started surfing the Internet to find free stuff sites to place my offer. I noticed how well built these sites were and everything was free. I knew there was $$ being made and I wanted to know how to make it too. I dug deeper and after a month I figured out what affiliate programs were. Many of the free offers were companies collecting information and would pay me up to $1.00 for a name and address and send a free product to that customer.\n\nIn three months I taught myself how to use Front Page and launched my first free stuff site free4women.com in late 1999. I made the free4wmaon.com site with 2 pages, 1 page with the TOP 100 FREE STUFF offers online, all these offers I get paid $$. The other page was a collection of legitimate FREE beauty product offers for women. These offers were REAL free offers that I did not get paid for, but was a GREAT way to market the site to get traffic. I worked VERY HARD loooong hours to market my site with every tool available to me. I created a personality called \u201cJanet\u201d for posting in forums..ect, because free stuff surfers respond more to women online than men. I had spent about $500 of my own $$ and I made that $500 back before I was able to spend more, so the site was paying for itself and then some. One of my biggest offers was an online bank called x.com (now PayPal). They offered $20 free to open a bank account online, and $20 for very person your refer, deposited to your x.com online bank account. X.com also sent a visa debit card for the account. The online form to open the account was one page, and short. You would see the $20 instantly in your new online bank account. I promoted that offer and made $2000 per week. I spent most of the $$ I made on promoting the web site. My web site was making $5,000 per month. I had an account with LinkShare.com and made about $10,000 for my first big check, it was scheduled to arrive in January 2000. I was worried about Y2K.\n\nlongdistanceflat.com @ https://web.archive.org/web/19991128041952/http://www.longdistanceflat.com/\n\nfree4women.com @ https://web.archive.org/web/20000816005758/http://www.free4women.com/beauty.htm\n\n---\nSteem City - Politics, Security, Tax, Trade, Police, and Social Services\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDdxihuCXMk\n\n---\n\nFollow @craig-grant\n\nhave fun : )",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Okay folks, just to spark your interest. When I am done with this SteemAway campaign for Ted I have plans to do something exciting with a car of mine (Very nice car) that will result in someone getting it delivered by me for free. &nbsp;So show your support for this amazing artist and then find out how you can get one of my cars for FREE (For Freedom).</p>\n<p>When \"<strong>Promote</strong>\" came on the scene and combining that with my previous attempts at pay it now has led me to this new iteration of STEEMAWAY. &nbsp;I have no doubt that once this algorithm is figured out correctly people are going to be filling up the site with steemaways. I hope with the geniuses behind SteemIt.com they will be able to filter these into their own category. Based on my newest change I think we are going to get there sooner rather than later @steemit</p>\n<h3><br>\nOkay biggest change: <strong>10 SBD = 1 Entry into the active</strong> <strong>SteemAway</strong>.</h3>\n<h3>There are <strong>two ways you can increase your odds</strong> by powering up your vote (Every Voter receives at least one entry):</h3>\n<p>1) Heavy Weighted Steem Power: We all know folks (Whales) with one vote can bring a lot of SBD to any post. Same as before the top ten voters with the highest cumulative weight q score will get 10 entries per their 1 upvote for that steemaway; so the top 10 usernames still get x10 for this steemaway's vote.</p>\n<p>2) I read the recommendations in the promote post of allowing us smaller fish in the sea to have ability to temporarily be whales. Well this is your chance. Every 10 SBD (No Limit!) you send @remington-art you will get 1 entry into the steemaway; so with 100 SBD you can get as many entries as the top ten whales.</p>\n<pre><code><em>Instructions on how to increase your odds: </em><em><strong>send SBD</strong></em><em> in increments of 10 (10SD/1Entry) to </em><em><strong>@remington-art with /world-famous-american-pastel-artist-gives-his-original-art-away-to-one-lucky-steemit-voter-and-you-can-also-vote-like-a-whale --in the memo</strong></em><em>.</em></code></pre>\n<h3><a href=\"http://steemaway.win/\">http://SteemAway.Win</a> to easily see who is steemawaying on STEEMIT</h3>\n<h1>Today's Painting:</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/AutumnBlossoms85dc1.jpg\" alt=\"AutumnBlossoms85dc1.jpg\" width=\"686\" height=\"904\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Autumn Blossoms</strong></p>\n<blockquote>I have always loved creating variations on Autumn scenes, the golden season, providing an Artist with stunning colors, the o most effulgent time of the year; affording an Artist an opportunity to turn inward as well as observe outwardly, letting the eyes and imagination to roam freely.</blockquote>\n<h2>Product Description</h2>\n<p>Dimensions: Image Size: 25\" x 20\"</p>\n<p>Medium: Soft Pastel</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The winner is welcome to pick any of Ted's previous SteemAway's (Except the $3,500 and any other sold already)<br>\n</p>\n<p>Throw your Steem Dollars (vote and/or donate) in for a chance to receive free an Original Painting with a personal message written on the back from the artist, Ted F. Remington.</p>\n<h3>Shipped to your home at <strong>NO COST</strong>. We have shipped all over the world.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>The Terms for this STEEMAWAY:</h2>\n<p>Minimum Steem Dollars for the Give Away (SteemAway): 2,000 SBD</p>\n<p>We will add up total SBD @remington-art receives (10SBD for 1Entry; unlimited on how much you donate); Votes received from all previous SteemAways. So keep voting to increase your chances of winning the current active SteemAway.</p>\n<p>Current SteemAway SD for Ted Remington: 501.944 SBD (Goal needed to be reached for this SteemAway is 2,000 SBD) so we are already getting there.</p>\n<p>One Randomly selected Upvoter/Donation-username will chose one of the equal value paintings Ted has posted thus far and comment below their selection. We will keep private information private and have several options for the winner to share their shipping address and personal note from Ted Remington written on the back of the painting (Optional); Steemit makes it easy to verify winner:) We will attempt to ship anywhere there is postal services -- FREE of Charge. Of course these paintings will need to be signed for and they will be insured. Once the painting is received we ask you please comment here confirming the fact (Pictures and/or blog post would be great!).</p>\n<p>The winner for this round will be announced here and also using random.org premium service to pick a name that is a independent third party publicly verified results. Ted and I plan to post one painting every day or two for the next 30 days, so follow me and you can also bookmark <a href=\"http://steemaway.win/\">http://steemaway.win</a> to see all current and past SteemAways.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Current Top Ten Heavy Weight Leader Board (Get x10 for this steemaway vote)</p>\n<p>SteemStats.com (I will be adding up sum of all previous steemaways vote weights for ted until the minimum for that giveaway is reached)</p>\n<p>(1)<strong>9,776.6q Weight @au1nethyb1</strong></p>\n<p>(2)<strong>9,366.8q Weight @nextgencrypto</strong></p>\n<p>(3)<strong>8,646.4q Weight @berniesanders</strong></p>\n<p>(4)<strong>8,547.1q Weight @silversteem</strong></p>\n<p>(5)<strong>6,675.9q Weight @complexring</strong></p>\n<p>(6)<strong>5,940.7q Weight @wang</strong></p>\n<p>(7)<strong>4,164.7q Weight @laonie</strong></p>\n<p>(8)<strong>3,034.1q Weight @roadscape</strong></p>\n<p>(9)<strong>2,951.4q Weight @silver</strong></p>\n<p>(10)<strong>1,312.5q Weight @riverhead</strong><br>\n</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "After writing my first introduction post without pics and receiving $0.03, and then reposting my intro with picks which earned $18.29, it quickly cemented in my mind the importance of having pics in my posts on Steemit. But you see, for me to include images in my posts is many times more difficult than the average Steemian. \n\n## Because I\u2019m vision impaired and can\u2019t see any of the images!\n\nHowever, somehow it seemed to me that to have any kind of success on Steemit, there was a commonly accepted rule that your posts need to contain images; whether you\u2019re writing a novel, or a philosophical piece, *almost all the trending posts have images!*\n\n### So, for the past few weeks of my Steemit life, I\u2019ve been asking my wife to help me find suitable pics for my posts. \nBut this has become an extremely stressful process, because we have a two year old son, and my wife rarely has any time to rest during the day. Therefore she looks forward to the small amounts of time that she gets to rest and relax in the evening. You can imagine how annoying it is for her when I\u2019m constantly interrupting her relaxation time, requesting her to find pics for me on Steemit. Thankfully, I\u2019m blessed with a kind and generous wife. She loves me very much, and often tells me that she is happy to help me with whatever I need, especially with what I love doing. But I don\u2019t want to be relying on her all the time. \n\nLast night however, when like previous nights, I asked my wife for her help.  But this time around, it was following a very exhausting week for her when my son and I had both been sick, and she had just recently become pregnant with our second child. So she blew up at me and became upset when I had taken up more than 40 minutes of her chill time. \n\n## And by the way, that post we worked so hard on all day earned us less than $1. \nSo this morning, I resolved to start writing about the topics I truly care about. No more stressing out about posts, no more fussing over optimum times to post my articles, and no more needing to find images for each post. \n\n# I\u2019m going to start enjoying my time on Steemit.\n\n## O yes, again, do we really need images on each post?\n\nFor more posts without images, follow me @nextgen622\n\nJimmy\n\nPS. Thanks @deanliu for the recommendation to post more Chinese articles. I will definitely do more of them in the future.",

Synereo has skyrocket, while Steem has lost 3/4 of its value.\n\nThis has also caused some movement and discussion here on Steemit itself. For instance @stellabelle who has the highest rep on here (or at least she used to) has [posted about synereo](https://steemit.com/synereo/@stellabelle/2-problems-plaguing-steemit-that-synereo-has-already-solved) and how it has solved some issues that steem has not. Has it though? It's not even live yet.\n\n# It is true, steem has issues: Retention! Retention! Retention!\nHaving been on the steem for about one month, I also see some issues with the site. Most importantly looking at the data, the biggest issue is that we have a big retention problem. Users sign on well but then seem to not stay active. This is bad. I don't know if this is normal and how this looks for other social media platform, but the [chart](https://steemit.com/steemit/@atomrigs/attention-whales-it-is-time-for-your-action) from @atomrigs does not look good.\n![steem](https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://s3.postimg.io/bzlvi7qlf/trend.png)\n\nConsequently it makes sense that the price of steem has crashed a bit, because with this user behavior a lot of the potential of steem is diminished. Again credit goes to @atomrigs.\n[chart](https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://s12.postimg.io/sbx0w3w1p/stock_price.png)\n\nI think we do not have enough data to draw correlation conclusions, however it is clear that investors are a bit timid right now. But I am less worried about the price, but the chart of new accounts vs account activity is a real problem and shows an issue that needs to be addressed. One thing that @atomrigs has missed in his post that in my mind is the most important indicator on steem are votes. The trend with votes looks exactly the same, so the chart of @atomrigs is good enough actually. But to be sure here are the votes. \n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmT6C3giuSinJw9Ymz81rzU5nRiSQXY2pvEMxP5Vnwcdta'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmT6C3giuSinJw9Ymz81rzU5nRiSQXY2pvEMxP5Vnwcdta'/></a>\n\nI have talked about what I think are the key problems that lead to these retention issues [here](https://steemit.com/steem/@knircky/i-love-steem-the-price-is-starting-to-hurt-one-last-bullet):\n- Activity has been stagnant according to the stats (even though it feels like more and better content is popping up all the time). While user growth can be seen every day, the amount of votes and post have not been going up since I joined even though the amount of users has roughly tripled in one month.\n- I think the voting does not work as well as expected. I find myself voting like a robot for things that i think will go viral, vs things that I like. My curation reward is usually between 0.01SP and 7SP. A huge difference. Of course I try to hunt the big rewards, instead of rewarding who and what I like. In fact I have voted for many post I thought were bad and things I did not like, just because I thought it was profitable.\n- The curve between highest paying post and low paying post as well as the ones in the middle is way to high in my opinion. I think there are many good posts that do not get rewarded, and others that are not that amazing that get way overrated.\n\nSo I see the issues with steem, but I am not too worried. I think they can be fixed and overall Steem has amazing design architecture and solves real problems that cannot be solved without its blockchain and business model. In particular I am talking about how content can be attracted and rewarded in a new financial model. So lets look at how steem compares with others.\n\n\n# Synereo: can someone explains how it works please?\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmexMkKTygLS6uNqqcQU7M5BZwzVXeVXvMhNtNXV75JiVB'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmexMkKTygLS6uNqqcQU7M5BZwzVXeVXvMhNtNXV75JiVB'/></a>\n\nI've been trying to understand how Synereo works. I started to read the white paper and pretty much gave up 1/2 way thru. It was a lot of fluff on the one hand and math formula on the other hand, both of which are useless when trying to analyze a project for investment purposes. I have also read some articles and watched video about it, but somehow nobody can just explain how it works in a few sentences or pages. This is always a red flag to me.\n\nHowever I see a few things that I find very fascinating about Synereo.\n- They are trying to create an economic model that reflects a social network. If this actually works it will be amazing. They are using a currency called REO that basically is supposed to reflect how important one is directly towards a particular network member and as a whole. This sounds very interesting, however the formulas with which they were trying to explain how this worked went a little over my head when I was trying to read it before going to bed.\n- The ability to pay for attention of certain people and likewise get rewarded for giving attention. This is where AMP comes in the currency one can buy right now on the market. Again how this works exactly I have not been able to grasp just yet. \n\nThere are however some red flags:\n- I don't understand the economic model yet, like how money comes in and out and how this thing can grow and take over the world and make its members rich and powerful. \n- The GUI I have seen by signing up for the beta looks horrendous and just as confusing as the white paper. This is another red flag. Its very early and the beta has not launched yet, so I am not judging quite yet.\n- While the coin has launched already I just received an email for another funding round, asking me to buy some shares of some company or buy more AMP. Again all this is confusing me. Why is there another round at this stage.\n- I have heard how there has been long development without much progress. So I am wondering if all the confusion I have seen is representative of an overall confusing culture.\n\nAs a result I will need to study this more, however I wonder if I can't understand this with some serious effort, what will regular people think. I will judge Synereo more when the real version comes out, but so far I am hesitant and have only invested a small sort of test amount and will re-evaluate once I have been able to test and understand it.\n\nInterestingly @Ned has made a similar comment about how he had trouble understanding the economic model in @stellabelle post. At least I am not alone here.\n\n# Yours network: I think its just a pretty name\n\nWhen it comes to Yours I have heard about it a few times and tried to research it, but so far did not find much content. Today there was a youtube video with the creator on epicenter bitcoin:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjJJi9Dqzvo\n\nI was not impressed with the video. There was lots of fluff and only a few minutes of the interview actually covered how yours works, the rest was general stuff like how facebook sucks and people on youtube do not make much money for generation content. Thank you Mr. Caption Obvious.\n\nFrom my understanding of the video Yours works like this:\n- It's a company running a website that works like youtube on a centralized server. It's a copy of reddit.\n- There is a payment layer that works in top of the website using bitcoin micro-transactions.\n- The micro-transactions are executed via lightning networks, which is still in development.\n- The site will take a cut from each transaction, that will be lower than what youtube takes, which is 40%\n\nThe economic model was not really explained, other than that site will simply take a cut from each transaction and it will be cheaper than youtube. Key question: how are prices determined?\n\nFrom the interview I think the developer is very focused in the technical side of things and a true business model is missing. I think is not very innovative, its simply laying a payment layer on top of existing platform that can very easy be copied by reddit, Facebook and youtube. And this can be done with paypal just as well.\n\nAt this point I don't think Yours has a real shot at being successful and I would not invest into it. I hope I am wrong and I wish the Yours team good luck.\n\n# I am happy I have recently poweredUp ever more\n\nAs I pointed out in this [post](https://steemit.com/steem/@knircky/i-love-steem-the-price-is-starting-to-hurt-one-last-bullet) I have constantly poweredUp since I joined steem and invested quite a few bitcoins into my Steem account. \n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmNfzSpVeGiekbko6k4WednrBT11KE2Yy4Eug9vxb73RVe'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmNfzSpVeGiekbko6k4WednrBT11KE2Yy4Eug9vxb73RVe'/></a>\n\nSo far it looks really bad, since I probably have lost 2/3 of my investment on paper. However I am confident in my decision because looking at Synereo and Yours I think Steem is looking good:\n- the business model is pretty clear, even if complex.\n- we have a working product that has attracted value, creating amazing content that would otherwise not exist\n- we have a fantastic team that is constantly adding new features to the blockchain and the website\n- @dan has shown in the past that he is capable of understanding problems both from a technical and business perspective and come up with a solution that covers both. He has done this over several years, the end result of which is graphene and this blockchain. \n- I think synereo has amazing potential but a very different business model and I think the two may co-exist, like twitter and facebook etc.\n- one of the biggest issues I saw, which was the attraction of outside money without diluting investors was solved today. I think it could have been done better, but the point is that the @steemit team is constantly improving and finding amazing new innovations that will bring steem forward\n\nIn this space we need to be able to handle swings and unfortunately losing 70% of value from its investment in a few weeks is normal in this new blockchain and crypto space. It's important to look at the fundamentals and trust in making the right decisions. Having reviewed steem and other upcoming solutions makes me confident that this for now is the best place to be part of and I am happy that I have diversified a portion of my crypto assets into the steem platform.\n\nI can't wait to see what new surprise the team will bring to steem next week and I am also looking forward to what other projects will have to offer.",

Conveniently, the city the cars were manufactured in was named after him too: Pontiac, Michigan. For their first post-WWII designs, Pontiac drew upon the heritage of their name and introduced the [Chieftan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_Chieftain) in 1949. The cars featured hood ornaments of Chief Pontiac, and the 1951 model's clear orange bakelite looks stunning in the sunlight. I came across this one on a city street and the hood ornament really caught my eye, with its intricate cracks from age sparkling in the light.\n\n<center>![1](http://i.imgur.com/Qe1TipU.jpg)</center>\n\n<center>![2](http://i.imgur.com/QqqsEAO.jpg)</center>\n\nThe car this beauty belongs to, an orange 1951 Pontiac Chieftan:\n\n<center>![car](http://i.imgur.com/sJcQFiH.jpg)</center>\n\n# A History Lesson\n\nHood ornaments started out on early automobiles that had their radiator caps outside of their hoods. Patented in 1912, the [Boyce MotoMeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce_MotoMeter),  was an early water temperature gauge that sat atop the radiator visible to the driver, and doubled as a cap. These were very popular on cars and even came standard on some models, until temperature gauges started to be mounted on the dash in the 1930s. \n\nAnd naturally they were decorated. They were aftermarket parts at first. Because the radiator cap was an easily accessible part, some early motorists bought special ones to make their car stand out.  Manufacturers decorated theirs too, and it became a trademark to distinguish a marque. Very often, the hood ornament would change year-to-year.\n\n<center>![Packard](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/1926_Packard_223_Two-Seater_Roadster_%27Fire_Chief%27_p3.JPG/1024px-1926_Packard_223_Two-Seater_Roadster_%27Fire_Chief%27_p3.JPG)\nA MotoMeter with a hood mascot on a 1926 Packard Six model 226. \n[Photo by Alf van Beem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1926_Packard_223_Two-Seater_Roadster_%27Fire_Chief%27_p3.JPG), public domain.</center>\n\n## Pontiacs\n\nThe name Pontiac was given to a new lower-tier and lower-cost marque created in 1926 by the Oakland Motor Car Company, a division of General Motors. This was a part of their [Companion Make Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Companion_Make_Program), a sales strategy that filled in the gaps of GM's tiers of quality and features. From Chevrolet at the most basic to Cadillac at the top, GM wanted a car to fit everyone's needs, wants, and budget. Pontiac was one step above Chevrolet. \n\nPontiac adorned their cars with a variety of hood ornaments featuring the signature Chief Pontiac. From the '20s into the '50s, the chief's face led Pontiacs, including as a face on the front of a jet in '55. The face left the jet in '56. Perhaps Pontiac's designers didn't like the juxtaposition of a 1700s native war hero blending into the Jet Age.\n\n<center>[![Pontiac ornaments](http://i.imgur.com/mWRxQZG.jpg)](http://www.pbase.com/mgrove/hood_ornaments)\nPontiac hood ornaments from 1928-1956. Click the image or [here for source](http://www.pbase.com/mgrove/hood_ornaments).</center>\n\n## Fashion Moves On To Safety\nIn the late 50s and early 60s, hood ornaments fell out of fashion for many car brands. Upmarket and luxury brands such as Buick, Cadillac, Mercedes Benz, and Jaguar kept the tradition up however. The iconic bulldog atop Mack heavy duty truck hoods did too. For 1968 cars, pedestrian-friendly safety regulations mandated that hood ornaments could no longer be fixed. Those who still had hood ornaments adapted to this by introducing ones that were spring loaded or attached to a flexible cable so they could bend back if their inattentive driver happened to plow down a poor old lady crossing the street. Blunt force trauma is better than getting stabbed by a shiny mohawk I suppose.\n\n<center>![mack](http://i.imgur.com/exgmWIo.jpg) ![cadillac](http://i.imgur.com/vjKhk3R.jpg)\nMack Truck and Cadillac hood ornaments. Photos by [Samdogs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/samdogs/489923835/) and [Charlie](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ceonyc/8405620690/)</center>\n\nThe new spring loaded ornaments combined with the luxury branding of the hood ornament holdouts led to many thefts in the '70s through '90s. Gradually even luxury brands ditched them, or only put them on their top-end models. Rolls Royce is a notable holdout. Today they put special engineering into their mascot, [The Spirit of Ecstasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_Ecstasy), dating back over a hundred years to 1911. A button can raise or lower it at the driver's control. And combining a safety and anti-theft measure, if it is hit with enough force it will also instantly retract.\n\n<center>![spirit](http://i.imgur.com/2c03COl.jpg)\nRolls Royce's Spirit of Ecstasy.

In addition to giving you their upvote.\n\nThis will allow you to do EVEN BETTER with your posts. Also, you can promote your stuff.\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/LcS63SL\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LcS63SL.gif\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n# Your SUCCESS In YOUR Hands! #\nYou can promote your own stuff, Sure it may not blow up into something large, But you'll at the very least get more followers. This will help future posts; Your investment will help you do well for future posts.\n\nSteemit is like a lottery, You can post high-quality content that is ignored, Sometimes your high-quality content is seen. Sometimes people don't even care about the topic you are talking about, and you have been ignored anyways. There are so many variables. It can be stressful when you work your butt off on a post that is just invisible. \n\nWith the post promotion, You can give yourself an edge on that. So it will be seen. If your post still doesn't do well, You can learn from it. Maybe you need a better title? better photos? \n\nI personally don't like my stuff left to chance, So the opportunity to make things happen makes me happy. \n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/oA9JsVb\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/oA9JsVb.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n# Businesses Can Advertise! #\nImagine if you were on Facebook, And instead of seeing those pesky ads on the site, You had a separate wall you could go to, With those ads. \n\n### Would you ever go to the wall of advertising? ###\nHell NO!\nI would avoid that like the plague. Unless they offered me some coupons or something, They would have to do something for ME!!\n\nSo what happens if businesses take over the promoted wall?\n\nPLEASE DO!\nThis advertising is perfect, The money spent on the promoted posts goes back into the system. (I don't understand all of the technical stuff)\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/qFti1Nr\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/qFti1Nr.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nBut  If Domino's Pizza wants to promote their new carry out pizza's for 7.99 on the promoted page, They will have to ADD MONEY to the pool. That WE can earn. In order to promote. I LOVE THIS! \n\nThat means Domino's pizza is putting money in OUR POCKETS!\n### Won't the advertising fail then? Because It's on a separate wall? ### \nIf it were Facebook, YES! But with Steemit, We are getting something out of their advertising. If big businesses don't get success from promoted posts, they won't promote on our platform anymore. And we'll have less money around as the result. \n\nThe principle of Reciprocity will come into effect.\n- Domino's gave you money, Now how about pizza for dinner tonight?\n\nApparently, if you hate pizza, You won't buy a pizza. But if someone is promoting cute shoes, you might just have to buy those shoes, I mean That company GAVE the platform more money for you to earn. You can buy a pair of shoes from them right?\n\nWith Facebook, there is no Reciprocity  Because the ads do nothing for you, With Steemit This is a beautiful form of advertising that will have  A BIG IMPACT.\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/8VApJlc\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8VApJlc.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n# So Why You Complaining? # \nSteemit made some exciting changes yesterday, And we need to be HAPPY! I'm so excited about the future of Steemit. You just have to think of the long term benefits of each change that is made, And how it may or may not benefit you. Some changes may hurt your short-term game but are good for the longer term. While other changes may not affect you at all! And if you deeply hate that promoted tab, You can always ignore it! No law against. that.",

Each round 21 witnesses are selected to create and sign blocks of transactions. Nineteen (19) of these witnesses are selected by approval voting, one is selected by a computational proof-of-work, and one is timeshared by every witness that didn\u2019t make it into the top 19 proportional to their total votes. The 21 active witnesses are shuffled every round to prevent any one witness from constantly ignoring blocks produced by the same witness placed before.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>As stated above the top 19 witnesses are \"elected\" by voting. &nbsp;The voting page can be seen </strong><a href=\"https://steemit.com/~witnesses\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>. &nbsp;This brings us to the problem:</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/12/blindfolded-senior-business-man-walking-through-social-media-data-000082574145_Small0c713.jpg\" width=\"841\" height=\"570\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Due to the nature of Steemit it is attracting people who are not necessarliy familiar with cryptocurrency concepts and the difference in the way that mining works can be confusing even to those who are familiar with conventional POW (proof of work) or POS (Proof of Stake).</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is understandably a lot of confusion in the community over the role of witnesses as well as who to vote for. There is also inconsistency in the information that witnesses and witness candidates provide to potential voters.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>A Potential Solution?</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/12/We-offer-solutions--business-card-000084741237_Smallfbee9.jpg\" width=\"829\" height=\"578\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Knowledge is power.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>With an appropriate set of questions and answers voters should be able to make an informed decision.</strong></p>\n<p>With this in mind I have crafted a questionnaire for witnesses and prospective witness candidates. This is a draft framework for community discussion. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The aim is to have a standardised set of questions that all witnesses and witness candidates answer in order to facilitate the process of witness voting for community members. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The questions are designed to be voluntary.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>It is up to individual candidates/witnesses if they answer them or not.</strong></em></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>THE QUESTIONNAIRE</h1>\n<hr />\n<h1>A) Technical Questions</h1>\n<h3><em>1)In a few sentences or less please explain the role of a witness in the Steemit/Steem ecosystem as you understand it.</em></h3>\n<h3><em>2)What are the most important qualities for a witness to have?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>3)How do you fulfil those qualities?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>4)Is there anything beyond this that you feel makes you a better witness candidate than the average person?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>5)What kind of hardware setup are you using and is it your own local hardware or rented?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>6)What if any contingencies do you have in case of an emergency or server failure?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>7)Do you think the current compensation for a witness is fair? &nbsp;If not what do you think would be fair compensation?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>8)What percentage (or fixed amount) of witness earnings should be kept and what percent invested back into the steem platform?&nbsp;</em></h3>\n<h3><em>9)How do you intend to use your witness earnings?</em></h3>\n<p><em>(Thanks to @geoffrey for suggestions for modifying the last 3 questions here.)</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>B) Current Witness Questions</h1>\n<h3><em>1)What challenges or problems have you faced in your role as witness?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>2)What other types of decisions do you think as a witness you should be involved in voting on?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>3)Are there any changes to the witness/mining system or structure that you feel would improve the system? &nbsp;Why?</em></h3>\n<p><em>(Thanks to @jesta for suggesting question 2.)</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>C) Community Questions</h1>\n<h3><em>1)What do you think makes Steemit special and worth supporting?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>2)How much do you use Steemit on average per week?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>3)What is your favourite type of post?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>4)Do you have a specific favourite post you would like to mention or link to? &nbsp;(Feel free to give a shout out to the author)</em></h3>\n<h3><em>5)What kind of posts do you dislike?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>6)How do you feel about the Steemit governance structure?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>7)How would you improve Steemit?</em></h3>\n<hr />\n<h1>D) Personal Questions</h1>\n<h3><em>1)How did you get into cryptocurrencies?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>2)What hobbies or interests do you have outside of Steemit and cryptocurrencies?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>3)What is your favourite movie genre?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>4)What is your favourite movie or movies?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>5)What is your favourite musical genre?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>6)What are you favourite bands/albums?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>7)What is your favourite book (fiction or non-fiction) and do you have a favourite author?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>8)What is your favourite TV show?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>9)Which is your favourite Star Wars movie from the original trilogy?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>10)Margarine or butter?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>11)The Beatles or The Rolling Stones?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>12)Have you ever tried Marmite?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>13)Are there any weird facts that you would like to share with everyone?</em></h3>\n<h3><em>14)Is there anything else that you would like other people to know about you?</em></h3>\n<hr />\n<h1>Conclusions</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/12/Business-person-having-bright-idea-000074154627_Small7f013.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Thank you for reading. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>As I have stated this is a starting point for community discussion. &nbsp;All the questions are voluntary - there is no way to compel people to answer, neither should there be. &nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The witnesses have a priviliged position in the Steemit ecosystem which gives them considerable power. Since people are required to vote for them it is in my opinion to be expected that people would like appropriate information in order to make an informed decision.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The \"personal\" section is designed to be fun and to help \"humanise\" candidates. &nbsp;I can understand if some people find the questions frivolous or irrelevant to the job of being a witness. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In regards to this one must consider the dilemma of the voter who may need some kind of alternative criteria to decide between different candidates who are equally capable from a technical standpoint.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Whether people feel that this makes voting a popularity contest or is in some way unfair is for the community to decide.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>If you like my work please follow me and check out my previous photography work and tutorials &nbsp;@thecryptofiend - hope you enjoy.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Credits for images - All Images are purchased from Istockphoto using my own personal account. &nbsp;Further information can be provided if requested.</em></p>\n</html>",

I have been writing short novels for some time, mostly in my native language (Italian).  \nNow, I would like to play around with the fact that Steemit easily enables us to collect decentralized contributions to any activity, including creative writing...    \n\nDo you want to play with me? Then it works in this way: \n\nI decide the abstract of a story, and write an introductory (very short) chapter, labelled as CHAPTER 1.\nThe first person willing to contribute is going to write a comment to the post containing a short chapter (labelled CHAPTER 2) which is logically connected to my CHAPTER 1 and develops the story...\n \nFurther contributors will post their own chapters as follow-ups to the last contribution submitted (e.g. CHAPTER 6, logically linked to CHAPTER 5). \n\nLet's see what comes out.. \n\nIF YOU DONT' HAVE MUCH TIME, JUST WRITE ONE PARAGRAPH OR TWO :-)\n\nAfter the first payment period (24 hours from now or so), I will post the stitched-up story resulting from your contributions (possibly with some edits, depending on my personal taste) and then we can continue from there for the next 30 days... \n\nOk, here we go: \n\nABSTRACT \nFabio and Emma are in their late 20s and live in London. Fabio is Italian, Emma comes from a small town in the north of England. Fabio has just lost his well-paid job in a major financial institution in the City, while Emma has just gotten a cool job in the fashion industry.  \nThey have been together for three years and want to have children, but the recent professional changes are putting their relationship under \npressure. Fabio would like to either accept an offer from Wall Street and move now to New York City, or take a sabbatical year for them to travel and decide where to go and what to do next...  \n\nCHAPTER 1 \nA funny smell in the subway. It's not unpleasant \u2013 just weird.  It reminds Fabio of one of Emma's body  odours...the one he likes most.  \nFabio was trying not to think about Emma for as long as possible, following last night's discussion. Sometimes he feels she doesn't realize how lucky they are: his savings can easily pay for 12 months of travelling, making love, and deciding where to go next. Ok, she has a brand new job, but they are still young and Fabio feels they should grab now their chance to travel and then decide where to settle down and have kids.  \nThe train stops. Time to get out. \n\nPLEASE POST YOUR FOLLOW-UP CHAPTER AND MAKE SURE YOU STATE CLEARLY YOUR CHAPTER n, WHICH SHOULD BE THE FOLLOW-UP TO THE CONTRIBUTION LABELLED AS CHAPTER n-1 \n\nImage credit: http://bit.ly/2cpqac3",

    "body": "The Mausoleum of Hadrian, now known as Castel Sant'Angelo, housed the remains of the Roman Emperor Hadrian and his family. Unfortunately, when the castle was converted into a fort, the remains were scattered and building looted. We can only imagine the splendor of the decor and visiting the remains of the emperor.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ansharphoto.com/Galleries/Cities/Italy/Rome/i-Wr4sGgX/A\"><img src=\"http://images.ansharphoto.com/2016/011-Ponte-Sant-Angelo-and-Castel-Sant-Angelo-in-the-Morning-Rome-Italy.jpg\" alt=\"Ponte Sant'Angelo and Castel Sant'Angelo in the Morning, Rome, Italy\" height=\"650\" width=\"976\" /></a>\nOctober 2013, single image, additional exposures for highlights, focal length 16mm, aperture f/11, shutter speed 131 seconds, ISO 100, ND 10-stop filter, tripod.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ansharphoto.com/Galleries/Cities/Italy/Rome/i-Wr4sGgX/buy\">You can buy this photo as Fine Art Print >></a>\n\n<br>\nAs the plague rolled in during the dark ages, it is said Archangel Michael appeared atop the mausoleum sheathing his sword. Many saw this as a sign of the end of the plague of 590 AD. The rumor was prevalent enough for the powers at be to rename the Castel Sant\u2019Angelo. Other rumors propose the supposed angel was actually a statue as recorded by a traveler 1000 years later. Miracle or art, we\u2019ll never know. \n\nI spotted no angels on this shoot, but the morning and sunrise light were still good after my initials shots of the Saint Peter\u2019s Cathedral and Ponte Sant'Angelo. In a way, good light always seems like a miracle to a photographer! \n\nIt was starting to get bright out, but for some reason the lanterns and other artificial lights were still glowing. The lanterns offered some extra light to play with in my photo. Achieving long exposure in such a bright scene required me to put on my 10-stop neutral density filter. \n\nTo setup the scene I took the classic view from the embankment capturing the Castel Sant\u2019Angelo and Ponte Sant\u2019Angelo reflecting in the Tiber water. The wind did me a favor by pointing the cloud strikes to the castle creating a natural visual trail towards the main subject of this photo. All in all I was pleased with the results.\n\nThe post <a href=\"http://blog.ansharphoto.com/city-skyline/castel-santangelo-in-the-morning-rome/\">Castel Sant'Angelo in the Morning, Rome</a> appeared first in <a href=\"http://blog.ansharphoto.com/\">Anshar Photography Blog</a>.",

I also plan to submit continuous updates on Bitnation, along with broader thoughts on the future of Virtual Nations and City States, Blockchain Applications, Virtual Jurisdictions, Cryptoanarchy, and more. I think Steemit is a wonderful way to empower Open Source Software (OSS) movements. But first, I want to give a yearly update on the STATE OF THE NATION: Bitnation</p>\n<p>/ Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, BITNATION Founder and Chief Unicorn</p>\n<p>(Image beneath featuring me and Alexandre Van De Sande in Rio de Janeiro, working on the DBVN protocol)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/susanneandalex088fc.jpg\" width=\"1368\" height=\"912\"/></p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p><br>\nBITNATION started July 14th, 2014, when I shared <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16HDB9AABa5rTOVFJj_8VLdOxgMguovLLAMviaTkZ1q4/edit?userstoinvite=fred.mazo@gmail.com,+btc@mundobitcoin.org&amp;pli=1\">this Google document </a>on Facebook, providing an overview of BITNATION\u2019s plan to build the world\u2019s first Blockchain Powered Virtual Nation. Within a few minutes volunteers from around the world gathered on Facebook and Skype and started discussing and promoting the concept.</p>\n<p><br>\nStarting Bitnation was challenging at first, because the concept was untested, and largely unheard of. Initially, the greatest confusion was around the word <em>governance</em>, because many people associated governance with decision making platforms, like democracy applications and other \u2018organizational governance\u2019 applications, rather than governance <em>services, </em>such as jurisdiction, security, etc. Two years on, the landscape is different. We\u2019ve implemented multiple proofs-of-concept (marriage, land titles, birth certificates, IDs, etc), explained the concept thoroughly in media, at meetups, and conferences, and a handful of others have leveraged the idea, and started implementing their own vision of it. The conceptual progress is tangible, but the greatest obstacle remains: mainstream adoption.</p>\n<p><br>\nWith mainstream adoption in mind, we spent over six month doing market research on what type of applications were used to conduct business in the fastest growing markets - emerging markets - where our services are needed to most, and in what way they were used. The result spoke loud and clear: smartphone chat applications. From WeChat in China, to WhatsApp in Brazil: everyone was on it, for business as well as pleasure. Hence, the road forward became obvious: we had to ditch the previous Pangea code, and start from scratch again, this time building our Blockchain Jurisdiction with a mobile phone chat interface.<br>\nStaying true to our principles, we had strict requirements: the application would need to be end-to-end encrypted, distributed and pseudonymous. After researching and testing several dozens of different codebases, we found Secure Scuttlebutt (SSBC), and its frontend applications, Patchwork and Patchbay. And thus, we begin Year 2: The Year of Pangea</p>\n<p><br>\n<em>Further Reading:</em></p>\n<p><br>\n<a href=\"https://blog.bitnation.co/what-is-bitnation-the-googlement/\">Pre-Foundational Document</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16HDB9AABa5rTOVFJj_8VLdOxgMguovLLAMviaTkZ1q4/edit\">Founding Document</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r_VqWrKQw07E06XAtMv_cZnFyBZma4PFTBJpM5GuzbA/edit\">Whitepaper</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Constitution\">Constitution</a></p>\n<p><strong><br>\nThe Year in Review</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Highlights of the Past Year:</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>The \u2018Accidental Proof-of-Concept\u2019: Citizens, Embassies, Consulates, Allies and Nations</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nWhile we were preoccupied with building the initial Pangea Proof-of-Concept on the Horizon blockchain, what turned out to be the actual Proof-of-Concept, the <a href=\"https://bitnation.co/\">Bitnation website</a>, emerged more or less accidentally. It started with a discussion about the <a href=\"https://bitnation.co/team-directory/\">Team Page</a> while we were renewing our website. I stated that the conventional hierarchical \u2018team page structure\u2019, with executives, employees and so on wasn\u2019t quite philosophically consistent with our decentralized governance movement. Instead, we should adopt a \u2018no-barriers-to-entry model\u2019 like the Swedish Pirate Party initially embraced, enabling anyone who wanted to be part of the Team to simply join and start contributing, without the need for approval from any kind of formal nor informal authority. Said and done, Amin Rafiee implemented it beautifully.</p>\n<p><br>\nHundreds of people signed up as team members in the next few days, and many of them asked: \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m a Citizen now?\u201d. Rather dumbfounded by the overwhelming request to become a Citizen through signing up on the website, we renamed the page to \u2018Citizen Directory\u2019 instead. And the signups kept on coming\u2026</p>\n<p><br>\nInspired by the instant Citizen signup success, we then added sign up as an Ally, sign up as an Embassy or Consulate, and most recently, sign up your Nation. Then the inevitable question arises: \u201cHow do we know these are real, well intentioned people, rather than spam accounts?\u201d. Someone bumped around the idea of manual vetting and approval, but it was quickly discarded by the community, for being a centralized and non-scalable approach. Instead, we came to consensus to experiment with a basic reputation system, a simplified e-Bay style implementation.</p>\n<p><br>\nAs the website gained more and more traction, a range of services were added, from our <a href=\"https://bitnation.co/notary/\">Public Notary</a>, to <a href=\"https://bitnation.co/education-network-ben/\">Education</a> and <a href=\"https://bitnation.co/citizen-security/\">Security Services</a>. In short, the website became a veritable governance service portal, within just a few months after its public launch in Q3/Q4 2015. At the time of writing, there are approximately 4000 Bitnation Citizens, as well as Embassies, Consulates and Allies spread throughout all continents (with the exception of Antarctica), connecting with the community, and using our governance services.</p>\n<p><br>\nAnd just like that, boom - a centralized and non-encrypted website, far from our puritanical Pangea vision, and devoid of any fancy code to speak of &nbsp;(besides the Blockchain ID and Notary) - became our rather arbitrary Minimum Viable Product (MVP). There it was, and it worked. Our much desired, yet very accidental, proof-of-concept :)</p>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN) on Ethereum</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nOne year ago I estimated it would take Bitnation approximately five years to reach full decentralization. Luckily, I was proven brutally wrong. Thanks to the Ethereum technology, and Ethereum based applications such as Backfeed, the space has evolved exponentially in a surprisingly short time frame. Regardless of what one might think of the now-infamous The DAO - the initial enthusiasm surrounding its rather spectacular launch indicated a clear market desire for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO\u2019s), a moment I had been eagerly awaiting since I started to research and write about DAO\u2019s at end of 2013.</p>\n<p><br>\nEarlier this year, in January, I was in communication with Alexandre Van De Sande, a very talented Ethereum designer and frontend developer. We were both in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro at the time, and we decided to get together in person to launch Bitnation\u2019s organizational structure on the Ethereum blockchain, as a customized version of Ethereum\u2019s MIST Wallet DAO code, the DBVN.</p>\n<p><br>\nKey differences between the DAO and the DBVN protocols are inclusion of the constitution on the blockchain, as well as code that attempts to reflect a more holocratic decision making processes, instead of the more commonly adopted democratic process. In my view, democracy is an outdated form of \u2018coercion by the majority\u2019, and from what we\u2019ve been privileged to observe over the last decade, organizations such as The Pirate Party, The Pirate Bay, Anonymous, Linux and, to some extent, even Bitcoin itself, a holocratic model appears to offer greater degree of personal autonomy.</p>\n<p><br>\nAs with most things blockchain, the DBVN code is in an early experimental phase at this time, our concept is significantly more ambitious than its current implementation. Fundamental to our philosophy, the holocratic elements will need significant improvements -- more specifically; the ability to instantly create \u2018holons\u2019 - autonomous and semi-autonomous groups which remains a part of the \u2018Genesis Nation Holon\u2019 infrastructure. This brings us to our second DBVN Code ambition: a full merger into the Pangea protocol.</p>\n<p><br>\nThe aim of Pangea isn\u2019t merely to be an OSS Blockchain Jurisdiction --- beyond its own dispute resolution services, its intent is to enable groups and individuals to create their own Nations and Holons straight onto the Pangea platform, without the need to fork and modify the source code, or have any coding knowledge whatsoever. We\u2019re in the process of designing the Nation and Holon creation functionality through SSBC/ Patchwork/ Patchbay\u2019s public nodes and chat channel infrastructure.<br>\n</p>\n<p>DBVN Ethereum Address: 0x5aaeb6053f3e94c9b9a09f33669435e7ef1beaed</p>\n<p>Watch the Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9UR7aVlF1A</p>\n<p>Contribute to the Code:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Constitution/blob/master/DBVN.sol</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Constitution/blob/master/profit-share.sol</p>\n<p>Read the first Code Audit, and Patch: https://medium.com/@crypto_nation/report-recursive-call-vulnerability-in-dbvn-sol-471d99e30659#.skrvxtg4i</p>\n<p><br>\nAdditionally, to foster increased innovation in the \u2018Virtual Nation Building\u2019 space, we have set up a hub for aspiring Nation Founders, where we can connect to, support and learn from each other. There\u2019s also Virtual Nation building resources, including OS Constitutions, Codes of Laws, DBVN setup instructions, and more. We hope this initiative will help other Virtual Nations to blossom, to create an amplifying effect on social and technological development speed in our shared space -- our shared ambition.</p>\n<p><br>\nDuring the DBVN process, we also recreated the Bitnation dividend paying cryptoequity token, XBN, on the Ethereum blockchain, to replace the XBNX tokens previously created on the CounterParty protocol. We have not yet released XBN on the market, because we\u2019re in the process of burning the previous XBNX CounterParty tokens, and enabling an XBNX to XBN Swapbot for the tokens that are currently in circulation. (If you have experience in the token burning and automated swapping field and want to contribute, please reach out to us)<br>\nFor decentralized fund allocation amongst the contributor community, we\u2019re working with Backfeed, a Slack chat plugin built on the Ethereum technology. Backfeed enables the contributor community (whether they\u2019re developers, administrators, marketing people, or others) to create projects, submit contributions, and get paid instantly for it, without the need for any type of top-down approval. Amongst all the \u2018organizational governance\u2019 applications we\u2019ve tested, from Colony to Boardroom and SwarmBot -- Backfeed is by far the most suitable to Bitnation\u2019s open and rapidly evolving community nature.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We\u2019re currently using many centralized platforms for our own organizational management, from Slack to Trello, Taiga to Google Drive, etc. However, I believe we\u2019ll be able to replace those applications -- eliminating the most significant centralized points of failure in the near future -- between the implementation of Pangea and Backfeed, and other technologies, like IPFS, Swarm etc. All these technologies exists, but they\u2019re generally in early Alpha or Beta, and many of them lack a non-developer friendly frontend, making its usage rather non-intuitive, as for now.</p>\n<p><br>\nFor our public communication needs, overtime we plan to shift our efforts from traditional platforms like Facebook and Twitter, to emerging blockchain based platforms, such as Steemit and Synero.</p>\n<p><strong><br>\n</strong><em><strong>In the Spotlight: BITNATION Refugee Crisis Emergency Response (BRER) and Public Notary Partnership with Estonia\u2019s e-Residency Program</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nSecond of September 2015 the photo of Alan Kurdi, the 3 year old Syrian boy in a bright red shirt, lying dead on a beach in Greece, shook the world, and the Bitnation community -- many of whom are open borders advocate, digital nomads, migrants, and more often than not, consider ourselves \u2018World Citizens\u2019 first and foremost. As Alan\u2019s photo made it around the world media, I was already living with stateless refugees in Turin, northern Italy, trying to assist them with their asylum processes, simply because they were my former employees from years back, during the time I worked in warzones, and I felt it was my duty to try help them to the best of my ability, just like they had always helped me when I was in their environment.</p>\n<p><br>\nOne of the magical aspects of Open Source Communities and Movements, is their ability to instantly gather and rally around a cause, as we\u2019ve seen movements like the Pirate Party and Anonymous do - and that was precisely what happened. Instantly, hundreds of activists gathered on our Slack chat, and in less than a week we had built a website for refugees, including a free Blockchain ID, Bitcoin Debit Cards, maps and forums. Later on, we updated the ID to the more sophisticated WORLD CITIZEN ID, which is also free.</p>\n<p><br>\nOne thing led to another, and while we were speaking to various UN agencies and NGO\u2019s to get the IDs accepted as temporary ID documents for paperless people, we were approached by the Government of Estonia. Most of the Bitnation community are dedicated anarchists who are not generally keen on working with governments, but in our enthusiasm to help refugees to cross borders, we realized we needed more recognition for our Nation from legacy entities, and Estonia\u2019s e-Residency program is famous for having an open mindset when it comes to \u2018global citizenship\u2019: hence we entered into a partnership with them to build a Blockchain Notary, and thus we became the first Virtual Nation in the world to be recognized by a Nation State. To put it in e-Estonia\u2019s own words:</p>\n<p><br>\n<em>\"In Estonia we believe that people should be able to freely choose their digital/public services best fit to them, regardless of the geographical area where they were arbitrarily born. We're truly living in exciting times when nation states and virtual nations compete and collaborate with each other on an international market, to provide better governance services.\"</em> - Kaspar Korjus, Estonia\u2019s e-Residency Director<br>\n</p>\n<p>And thus, the Public Notary was built a few weeks later, including login and digital signatures, and has since been used for everything from Marriages to Wills, to Birth Certificates, to Business Deals, Employment Contracts, and Lending Contracts, and the list goes on...</p>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>3rd Party Applications and Services - Basicincome.co, Dragonfly and Exosphere</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nCore to the governance service proposition, is the aggregation of services, which includes selection and vetting of vendors and bulk price negotiations. To that end, we have identified and partnered with a few cutting edge organizations for peer-to-peer insurance, security, and education. We aim to increase the number of partnerships in the year ahead.</p>\n<p><br>\nThe Exosphere bootcamp program is on its second round, offering Bitnation citizens a 1000 Euro discount. Special thanks to Moritz Bierling from Exosphere for organizing it. You can read about the first round here. The first insurance component to be enabled is Johan Nygren\u2019s Basic Income protocol, based on voluntary participation, similar to that of a mutual insurance. Johan has worked on the protocol for several years, and has lately been developing it on Ethereum. We\u2019re preparing to run the first tests of a simplified version of the protocol within the Bitnation core contributors group.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Challenges and Lessons Learned:</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>Technical Challenges I - Blockchains and Smart Contracts</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong><br>\n</strong></em>The foundational document for Bitnation stated our intention was to build on Ethereum, because of its near Turing completeness enabling Smart Contract functionalities. Ethereum at the time, however, was far from being released, and the community felt the urge to produce a proof-of-concept to get real world testing and usage of our idea. In retrospect, it might have been better to build on the Ethereum testnet right away, rather than using other blockchains. But social and financial pressure pushed us to choose the most suitable alternative out there at the time: the NXT/ Horizon technology, and make the best out of it until Ethereum became functional. We\u2019ve now switched over to Ethereum development, as originally planned.<br>\n</p>\n<p>However, Ethereum isn\u2019t a \u2018silver bullet\u2019 either - suffering from internal governance issues, security vulnerabilities inherent to Turing capabilities, and an immature infrastructure in terms of exchanges, wallets, etc. Hence, Ethereum is also a bit of a \u2018wild bet\u2019, albeit a very promising one - due to its original ideas, stellar implementation, and a large, vibrant community backing it.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Rootstock - a Bitcoin blockchain based smart contract platform - which will likely be publicly released this year and, from what I\u2019ve read, they\u2019ve pledged to use the same Smart Contract language as Ethereum - Solidity - to increase cross-platform portability. Ultimately, we would like to give people the choice of what blockchain to use for their agreements as easily as they can choose their code of law and arbitration method on Pangea. That\u2019s of course an optimistic ambition at this time, but if the crypto community stays as innovative and active as it currently is, I do dare to believe that some sort of bridge functionality we can incorporate into Pangea will emerge in the next year ahead.</p>\n<p><br>\nAnother platform we\u2019re keeping tabs on is Tauchain. Tauchain claims, among other features, to solve some of the security issues around smart contracts, through <em>not </em>being Turing complete. We\u2019re looking forward to see how it will pan out, once it\u2019s been released and tested on the market.</p>\n<p><strong><br>\n</strong><em><strong>Technical Challenges II - User Behavior (Chat versus Social Networking)</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nSocial networking platforms, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, has been the dominant social media arena over the last decade. Thus, it\u2019s intuitive to attempt to replicate that format. But the numbers don\u2019t match up -- in the fastest growing markets, the emerging markets around the world where our services are most needed, the so called \u2018next eleven\u2019, Facebook comes across as rather \u2018yesterday\u2019. Albeit a +1 billion person adoption, more and more people are switching over to chat applications to conduct their day-to-day bussines (special thanks to Gene Vangryeb from Tradle.io for his insightful thoughts on this). The change is largely due to the choice of smartphone rather than laptop as the go-to-device, and it turns out chat is more intuitive as a way to communicate on a smartphone, rather than a \u2018publishing platforms\u2019 such as social networks. Using social network platform as an inspiration was a significant mistake, indeed, our one most significant mistake. All transactions starts with a <em>conversation</em>. Whether getting married, or trading a real estate asset, it\u2019s all based on a dialogue between mutually consenting parties. More and more of these conversations take place online, as business as well as personal relationships increasingly move into the digital sphere.</p>\n<p><br>\nChatting with a blockchain as a backend infrastructure is incredibly expensive -- imagine paying miners\u2019 fees for every chat message you send. Sure, there are ways around it, like using a blockchain testnet instead of the live blockchain, and other fixes, but those are all rather clunky \u2018solutions\u2019. Hence, we decided to swallow our pride, ditch the code, and start from scratch again. This time around with a decentralized communications protocol as the source code (SSBC/ Patchbay) and integrate the blockchain functionalities (timestamping and smart contracts, more specifically) \u2018on top of it\u2019 instead, hence not being dependent on any one blockchain.</p>\n<p><strong><br>\n</strong><em><strong>Lack of Documentation</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nOne of our most fatal mistakes, in the first iteration of the Pangea software a year ago, was the lack of documentation. When we initially created Pangea, we were eager to produce a proof-of-concept, to make our idea more tangible to the community and early adopters. In the speed and enthusiasm that unfolded in the early stage of development, the documentation suffered. As much as we produced code, there was nearly zero documentation to support it. In an Open Source Software (OSS) environment, dependent on volunteers coming and going, on their own initiative, throughout different time zones, languages and cultures, it\u2019s key to be able to provide a direct, comprehensible and actionable overview of the software being built, so community members can instantly understand what needs to be done, and where their skills fit into the picture. However, we failed to do so. Hence, we became dependent on a few contributors, rather than the community at large, indeed a risky place to be in. Many volunteers wanted to contribute to Pangea, but there was no documentation to instruct them how to take it forward. In other words, the code was a jungle.</p>\n<p><br>\nIt was a hard lesson to learn, but I\u2019m happy we learned it early on in the process, and can change our \u2018modus operandi\u2019 for this Pangea iteration. We\u2019ll now put documentation at the highest priority, even if it means delivery speed might suffer as a consequence at times.</p>\n<p><strong><br>\n</strong><strong>Objectives For The Year Ahead:</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>Bitnation Pangea Development</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong><br>\n</strong></em><strong>Why Build A Jurisdiction?</strong></p>\n<p><br>\nA nation is a broad definition, covering several aspects, from its original term of \u2018people with shared culture and values coming together with some sense of political autonomy\u2019 - as per the Wikipedia definition - to our modern definition of governance service providers, and governance service aggregators.</p>\n<p><br>\nToday we expect governments to provide us with nearly everything - from education to energy infrastructure, food regulations to social security - and the list seems to grow by the day. However, if we break the government down to its essential functions, according to the \u2018Nightwatchman State model\u2019 as championed by Robert Nozick - the government's core purpose only really comes down to the protection of property - i.e. the provision of security and jurisdiction. Note: property is a broad term, not solely referring to property as in land, items, etc. Property starts with ownership of yourself, your body, your time, your aspirations, etc.</p>\n<p><br>\nIn the digital age, security and jurisdiction are increasingly becoming the same thing, as more of our assets (money, asset records, work etc) become digital. Furthermore, the extremely rapid development of Smart Contract technology opens new horizons in terms of creating online agreements with a range of built in automated functions (fund and token distribution, escrow, insurance, timestamping, decision making levels, etc). Hence, it makes sense for Bitnation to focus on building a Blockchain Jurisdiction as its core functionality.<br>\nWithin the smart contract functionality, sophisticated governance applications can already be built directly by end-users, such as mutual insurances, constitutions, etc.</p>\n<p><br>\nImagine solving a dispute by sending a heart <3 emoticon. An emoticon that calls upon Ethereum Smart Contract functionality - including an embedded escrow account - according to the code of law and the arbitration method that you have chosen for yourselves - and all of it in less than two minutes, from the comfort of your own phone. Our aim with the Pangea platform is to empower people to make sophisticated legal agreements simply through the use of emoticons in a smartphone chat interface. The frontend will be built using React.JS, as originally planned, because it\u2019s better suited for mobile first applications.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Initial Technical Overview</strong></p>\n<p><br>\nThe codebase we\u2019re using is Secure Scuttelbutt (SSBC), a distributed and end-to-end encrypted messaging protocol, and its frontend application Patchbay. It\u2019s more decentralized than other chat applications currently on the market, including Signal.</p>\n<p><br>\nDecentralized storage will be done through integrating IPFS as well as Swarm (the Ethereum powered storage application) on the frontend layer. Initially our plan is to integrate functions calling on the Ethereum chain for smart contract creation and execution, but we hope we\u2019ll be able to use Rootstock and other protocols in the future, in addition to Ethereum. The platform however is <em>not</em> blockchain based.</p>\n<p><br>\nThe pseudo-anonymous ID/ Verification/ Reputation functions will be built from the ground up, on the advice of Dominic Tarr, the SSBC inventor, although we\u2019ll use some of the digital signature features developed for Bitnation\u2019s World Citizenship ID by Johan Paulsson, Andrew Golighty, Mawo, SGShankar and others. Additionally, we\u2019re drawing inspiration from the identi.fi philosophy, developed by Marrti Malmi.<br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Participants, Messages &amp; Channels</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p>Pseudo-anonymous identities provide the critical separation between a citizen\u2019s thoughts and actions and the potential for coercion of their physical bodies in order to restrict or control those thoughts and actions. Pseudo-anonymous identities are thus, by design, a declaration of independence from centralised governance models. For them to have meaning they must have three elements. Firstly, and obviously, the protocol that enables pseudo-anonymous identities to to be created, secondly the process for verifying an identity (which can range from social network verification to uploading a copy of a utility bill, for instance), and lastly, and most importantly, the reputation system, which is built over time and represents the judgement of each citizen\u2019s community of their willingness and ability to honour and arbitrate contracts.</p>\n<p><br>\nFor internal management, BITNATION uses a holacratic governance model. The underlying principle is that all BITNATION citizens are free to create their own holons, and ultimately their own Nations, without any barrier to entry or need for technical knowledge. SSBC provides the means for BITNATION adherents to create their own holons and Nations without any requirement for centralised approval. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Contracts, Contract Arbitration Models, Contract Enforcement Models and Incentives Models</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p>Sovereignty starts with the ability of individuals to make consensual agreements with others. We consent to give our sovereignty to Nation States by believing their rhetoric: that only Nation States can uphold those agreements. But what if we could make and enforce contracts without third party intermediaries who choose to use that power to enforce their methods upon us? Just as citizens can choose their own code of law, they must also be able to choose their own preferred method of arbitration. These can range from choosing a trusted arbitrator to mediate contract disputes to utilising a crowd jury to make final judgements. A voluntary contract must also mean that citizens can choose from a range of enforcement methods. These could include reputation, escrow or physical enforcement (peer-to-peer security). We anticipate that the most widely used form of contract enforcement will be the reputation system. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\nWe believe that financial incentives hold promise for the future. To that end we are exploring a range of financially incentivised models for dispute resolution where participants get rewarded for honouring contracts, building their reputation, and providing arbitration services. However, there will be no \u2018dispute resolution\u2019 token anytime soon, although we\u2019re monitoring current token platform incentive models for potential future usage.<br>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Potential Synergies</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nIn light of the release of Ethereum, and the subsequent growing Smart Contract field, many initiative centered around peer-to-peer law, security and jurisdiction services are being experimented with. I would like to take the opportunity to mention a few of the most interesting ones in our field, whom I hope, moving forward, we\u2019ll be able to learn from, and potentially collaborate with.</p>\n<p><br>\nBitrated: Bitrated was the first well known attempt to implement Bitcoin based dispute resolution. They created a user-friendly, intuitive proof-of-concept, including basic escrow and reputation features. We\u2019ve always been impressed and inspired by Bitrated, and hope we can collaborate in the future.</p>\n<p><br>\nDecentralized Arbitration and Mediation Network (DAMN): DAMN is an Ethereum based dispute resolution protocol proposed by the well known Bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos and the Attorney Pamela Morgan. The aim of DAMN differs from Bitnation, in the sense they aim to create a legal platform compatible with existing Nation State Jurisdictions, rather than creating an independent blockchain Jurisdiction. However, we\u2019re positive we can gain valuable insights from their work, and we will follow their progress closely.</p>\n<p><br>\nULEX: ULEX is an attempt by Chapman University Professor Tom W. Bell to code a simplified and modulable code of law, based on Common Law. While Bitnation firmly believes in Polycentric Legal Models, i.e. multiple competing codes of law, we recognize this particular code of law holds a lot of promise, and will work to integrate it as soon as there\u2019s a working version of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\nReputation Systems: I would like to give a shout out to Steemit and Synereo for their work on token based reputation systems, which we\u2019ll study in depth for potential future usage, as well as identi.fi, a non-blockchain based reputation system, which we draw most of our ID/Rep inspiration from, specifically in terms of \u2018good anti-social behaviour strategy\u2019 in the context of whitelisting versus blacklisting methodology.</p>\n<p><br>\nThank you for the interesting technologies and the community contribution you\u2019re doing with your work.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Join The Governance Decentralization Movement</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"slack.bitnation.co\">Slack</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Bit-Nation\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bitnation.co/\">Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyBitNation\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MyBitnation/\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><br>\n\"<em><strong>I am the seasoned traveler</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Of the Labyrinth.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>The genius of alacrity,</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Wizard of the impossible.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>My brilliance is yet unmatched</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>In its originality.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>My heart\u2019s filled with potent magic</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>That could cast a hundred spells.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>I am put together</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>For mine own pleasure</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>I am the Monkey\"</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nChinese poem on The Year of the Monkey - 2016<br>\n</p>\n</html>",

using a different photo of Gabby</a> here is another tutorial where I am to go from start to finish. &nbsp;In this case I am going to do it in 2 parts since the post length was getting too long. &nbsp;In this first part I will just cover basic adjustments in Lightroom and blemish removal (mainly) in Photoshop. &nbsp;If you are unfamiliar with any of these techniques I would suggest going back to my previous tutorial mentioned above and these other 2 tutorials: <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@thecryptofiend/quick-portrait-retouching-in-lightroom-tutorial\">Quick Portrait Retouching in Lightroom </a>and <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@thecryptofiend/how-to-fix-damaged-photos-in-photoshop-tutorial-with-example-image\">How to Fix Damaged Photos in Photoshop.</a></p>\n<p><em>In the second part I will use some of the techniques I covered in </em><a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@thecryptofiend/easy-black-and-white-portrait-conversion-using-nik-silver-efex-pro-2-photography\"><em>my tutorial on black and white conversion</em></a><em> in Nik Silver Efex Pro 2.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Lightroom Edits</h1>\n<p>Here is the initial .NEF or RAW image in Lightroom. &nbsp;It looks a bit dull.</p>\n<h3>Exposure Adjustment</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_011beda.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"458\"/></p>\n<p>So I am going to increase the exposure a little to + 0.70. &nbsp;There is some mild clipping of whites in the histogram but I am not too concerned about that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_02b00b7.png\" width=\"241\" height=\"594\"/></p>\n<h3>Some Quick Blemish Removal</h3>\n<p>I'm also going to use the Spot Heal tool to do some basic blemish removal. &nbsp;This isn't absolutely necessary because I'm going to be doing more blemish removal in Photoshop. &nbsp;There are a few things that stand out and are fine to remove using the more basic LR tool. &nbsp;For example the piercing in Gabby's ear stands out because she isn't wearing an earring in this ear. &nbsp;So I've removed that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_04e6452.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"487\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_03be1d6.png\" width=\"283\" height=\"343\"/></p>\n<p>The Spot removal tool is the large circle to the right of the crop tool symbol (9 part rectangle).</p>\n<p>Now I'm ready to Open the Image in Photoshop. &nbsp;So I right click on it Edit&gt;Edit in Adobe Photoshop CC and that opens it in a new Photoshop window.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Photoshop Editing</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_06d03ac.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"454\"/></p>\n<p>The first thing in PS is to create a new layer Cmd(Ctrl in Win)+Shift+N is the shortcut to do this. &nbsp;I am going to name the new layer Skin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_0576e41.png\" width=\"755\" height=\"266\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_1256676.png\" width=\"276\" height=\"377\"/></p>\n<p>I'm mainly going to use the spot healing brush tool to remove blemishes. &nbsp;This comes down to subjective judgement but as I've said before you don't want to remove too much as you will lose skin detail. &nbsp;It doesn't matter quite as much for a photo like this compared to say an extreme close up shot of the face where overdone retouching will just look plain weird.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_0719cbc.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"585\"/></p>\n<p>One of the ways to do this and decide what to remove and what to keep is to look at the colour of blemishes. &nbsp;I tend to remove large red blemishes as these tend to be signs of inflammation. &nbsp;Leave smaller ones as that is a part of natural skin texture. &nbsp;I also leave any brown marks as these are freckles and moles and tend to add character to the face and skin. &nbsp;Nobody, no matter how great their skin is, is free from these so completely removing them can look odd.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_08e8920.png\" width=\"684\" height=\"385\"/></p>\n<p>Keep Zooming in and out to get an overall impression of the face.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_09bfd43.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"588\"/></p>\n<p>Here I can see the face doesn't really need any more work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_109d71c.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"589\"/></p>\n<p>Normally I wouldn't remove the blemishes on the arms very much but on the zoomed out photo they are distracting from the face.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_13aeb27.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"590\"/></p>\n<p>Due to the distraction that they were creating I've removed more blemishes than I would normally on the arms. &nbsp;If you feel you have gone too far you can always use a layer mask to paint them in or out depending on what you want to do. &nbsp;You can also reduce the opacity of the entire layer. &nbsp;Since this is not a photo where the arms are the main subject it really is not so important. &nbsp;So I will just leave them like this (below).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_14c803e.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"591\"/></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Save and Reopen in Lightroom</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_1517fbb.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"592\"/></p>\n<p>Here is the zoomed out view. &nbsp;The photo looks done to me. &nbsp;So I will save it and close Photoshop. &nbsp;This will take me back to Lightroom. &nbsp;This means that I have a basic copy of the colour photo that has been retouched and I can use as a basis for more creative changes. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Screenshot_GEOAI_02_1762278.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"449\"/></p>\n<p>If I want to change it again I will either create a virtual copy first (just

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Hi All</p>\n<p>Yesterday I read the article by 'cryptogge' titled \"A quick fix for a broken capitalist society.\" The purpose of this blog is not to discuss the article, rather on the question the author 'cryptogge' asked me after I corrected him, on the length of the UK electoral cycle. He claimed that it was four years. I corrected him in comments. It is 5 years. Kudos to cryptogge: he acknowledged his error. It was the following words by cryptogge that caught my attention. He said in reply, \"What do you think about a 10 year cycle? Does that sound too long, or do you think we'd get better results from our politicians with a longer cycle?\"</p>\n<p><strong>Bloody Hell. Where do I start.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Here is my answer. The West is filled with corrupt, inept, sociopathic liars. These people I am talking about are called Politicians, The old joke, \"How do you tell if a Politician is lying? Answer, his lips are moving.\" This has never been more true than it is today.</p>\n<p>Let us look a little closer.</p>\n<p>OBAMA ( The liar in chief) &nbsp;\"If you like your Doctor: you can keep your Doctor.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No boots on the ground in the Middle East.\" ie &nbsp;Syria or Iraq.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Whopper of a lie, &nbsp;&nbsp;\"The un-affordable care act. This will cause little in the way of premium hikes.\"</p>\n<p>He claimed that it would be the cost of a monthly mobile phone bill.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I could go on with Oduma's lies, but it is beyond the capability of the memory left on my Mac. This Politician has bombed, invaded countries, &nbsp;and droned innocent men, women and children to death. He has also destroyed the American economy and doubled the USA debt to $19.5 trillion, in 7 years; to name just a tiny few of his <strong>\"accomplishments\".</strong></p>\n<p>DAVID CAMERON, the UK Prime Minister at the time, threatened us, the British people with anything and everything from dirty beaches to an economic collapse. He did this in order to secure a REMAIN vote win. This was on behalf of the globalists wet dream of \"The European Union.\" (If you want a little more detail on Brexit, watch \"Brexit the movie, on youtube.) you will then see just how bad these bat shit Euro crack pots are. They waste time and money at the same time, feathering their own nests.</p>\n<p>Hi, Cameron. Nothing happened after Brexit. the stock markets are up, employment is up, and countries around the world are lining up for trade deals. This shows clearly how inept you are. (By the way he has doubled our debt in the UK to 1.5 trillion pounds. Way to go pig fucker.)</p>\n<p>The last one I would like to use is MAD MERKEL in Germany. (I could talk for hours on other Politicians but it would be outside the scope of this article.) Yes, Merkel has allowed in hundreds of thousands of refugees and African financial migrants. The German people are now subject to daily</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Murders</li>\n  <li>Rapes</li>\n  <li>Sexual assaults</li>\n  <li>Many more illegal acts such as theft.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yes the integration is going so well, NOT. Despite the overwhelming push back by the general population (perfectly illustrated by her parties defeat last weekend by the alternative for Germany AfD Party) she still is defiant. She said, \" If I could go back in time, I would make the same decision.\"</p>\n<p>The problem is that these Politicians, when elected, hardly ever fight for the views and needs of the people who elected them. No, they go power mad and do what ever they please: and screw the pions, sorry the electorate.</p>\n<p>I conclude that crytogge should have asked, \" How can we dismantle BIG GOV. and bring the power back to the people?\"</p>\n<p>http://i67.tinypic.com/r1esuf.jpg</p>\n<p>I leave you with the words that President Regan said were terrifying, \"I'm from the Government and I'm here to help.\"</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading,</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Gazza.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>In December 2013 I had the good fortune to make a flying 4 day visit to Rome. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was to visit my sister in law's family who are Italian and had been unable to make my brother's wedding in England a few months earlier. &nbsp;Unfortunately there was very little time to do sightseeing. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>One thing I absolutely wanted to see was the famous Trevi Fountain. &nbsp;Due to reasons I will get to in the text below this ended up being rushed as it was getting late and close to sunset. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm quite pleased with the photos though. &nbsp;I selected a split tone process in Silver Effex Pro to give them this unique tone.</p>\n<p>I just wish I had more time to do some proper sightseeing and photography of all the amazing architecture.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Trevi Fountain Photos</h1>\n<p>Basic information about the fountain from Wikipedia (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevi_Fountain\">link</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>The Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is a fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Pietro Bracci. Standing 26.3 metres (86 ft) high and 49.15 metres (161.3 ft) wide,[1] it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world. The fountain has appeared in several notable films, including Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita.</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b21of23f6165.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b19of23fd6ff.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b14of2366864.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>3</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b15of2317b78.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>4</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b16of231f361.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>5</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b17of237ed99.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b18of2326902.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>7</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b20of23a3251.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>8</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b22of231ba03.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p>9</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b23of23f0c1d.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>10</p>\n<h1>A few selected other shots from the walk to the Fountain:</h1>\n<p>The walk to Trevi Fountain itself had some interesting sights which I tried to capture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b1of1633f1.jpg\" width=\"799\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>11</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01c1of1bf699.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p>12</p>\n<p>This was another fountain that just happened to be in the centre of a large roundabout on the walk to Trevi Fountain. &nbsp;Don't know what it is called - there are so many fountains around Rome - there was just too much to photograph and it was getting close to sunset. (As the photo below shows.)</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b1of232a1f5.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>13</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b12of23096e6.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p>14 - I loved the textures on some of the old buildings. &nbsp;Being pushed for time I tried to take some shots whilst I could.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b11of2341f7d.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>15 - Here one can see the contrast between new and old.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01d1of1acb34.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>16 - I loved the shapes and lines here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b5of23547ad.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>17 - The walk consisted of lots of these kind of very narrow alleyways. &nbsp;This seems to be common to most historic cities. &nbsp;Some are so narrow that they feel claustrophobic.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Rome's Worst Bus Tour</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b3of2379c07.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>18 &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Prior to going to Trevi Fountain and one of the reasons for the delay was that we took a bus tour of Rome. &nbsp;Unfortunately the driver seemed to be high on Coke or something because he was in a mad rush to go from place to place. &nbsp;In the end we didn't actually get a chance to see very much because of this. &nbsp;This was the only photo that I managed to get from that tour. &nbsp;I think it is a museum but I'm not sure. &nbsp;Maybe someone recognises this building?</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Technical Information:</h1>\n<ul>\n  <li>Nikon D7100 Camera</li>\n  <li>Sigma 24-70mm/2.8 lens</li>\n  <li>Adobe Lightroom CC and Nik Silver Effex Pro for processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope you like the photos. &nbsp;If you like my work please follow me and check out my previous photography work and tutorials &nbsp;@thecryptofiend - hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p><em>(Verification for me here: </em><a href=\"http://www.aapicture.com/about-me\"><em>http://www.aapicture.com/about-me</em></a><em>)</em></p>\n</html>",

That's why we launched our $1 campaign, where we're asking every riseup user to give us just $1 a month!\n\nI didn't see any other donation post for RiseUp, so I thought it'd be great to run a STEEM fundraiser for them.\n\n<center>![](https://riseup.net/en/about-us/img/riseup-yellow.gif)</center>\n\n**What is RiseUP and why should I care?**\n\nRiseUP provides many services to whistleblowers and journalists, such as email, chat, VPN, among other things. Many people depend on them to allow them to keep the world safe.\n\n>Our purpose is to aid in the creation of a free society, a world with freedom from want and freedom of expression, a world without oppression or hierarchy, where power is shared equally. We do this by providing communication and computer resources to allies engaged in struggles against capitalism and other forms of oppression.\n\nEven if you don't personally use RiseUP, you can help protect free speech by donating to RiseUP here: https://riseup.net/en/donate\n\n**What about this post?**\nI will also be donating 100% of the value of this post (i.e. both SBD and SP value in whole) to RiseUP via Bitcoin. [I personally donated ~$60 of my own money just before writing this article](https://blockchain.info/tx/6a031de304db74cb90da261da65d4ac89edb768325011a33100058b851ebae8d)\n\nAs soon as the post pays out, I will be sending the value of this post as a donation to RiseUp, and posting proof as a separate post.\n\n\nPlease spread the word so we can protect freedom.\n-------",

    "body": "People have talked about how one day we may have large advertising companies eventually competing for the top 'promoted' slots. While some people may strongly dislike the idea of seeing adds on Steemit, I feel that it will do us more good than harm. Advertisers paying to create adds on the promoted page will create more of a demand for Steem/SBD. I searched to see if anyone has tried this yet, and it looks like nobody has tried this yet.

Vladimir Putin ordered these readiness checks in the Southern, Western, and Central military districts.\n\nHe is also moving naval vessels into key spots within the Black and Caspian Seas and has \"combat alert\" troops as well as aviation equipment positioned at strategic, tactical, airfields along the Ukrainian border, ready for the \"containment of a crisis situation\" to use his words.\n\nA Unian.info article highlights these moves by saying, \"Fighter and bomber aircraft, as well as military transport and attack helicopters will carry out flights of between 500 to 2,500 kilometers\" the press service of the Russian Defense Ministry reported.\n\nOn the other side of the Ukrainian border, globalist puppet \"Porky\" Petro Poroshenko has also been putting his troops on high alert after Vladimir Putin recently accused Kiev of \"using terrorist tactics to try to provoke a new conflict to destabilize Crimea\".\n\nAs Poroshenko amassed $850 million in 2015 and became the only Ukrainian businessman to see his net worth increase that year, he promised the people of Ukraine he would \"embed new traditions\" and \"sell his assets immediately after occupying the post\". He obviously never fulfilled this promise and the people have continued to suffer as they always do after the US and NATO bring \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" to a country.\n\nPutin knows that with NATO and the globalist elites propping up Ukraine, subverting Syria, and putting pressure on him, they are trying to back him and his allies into a corner in an effort to incite retaliation and chaos. In fact, prospects of a nuclear war are probable enough in Putin's mind for him to start constructing <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3741902/Russian-military-building-new-underground-bunkers-withstand-nuclear-war.html\">scores of \"nuclear proof\" subterranean bunkers</a> capable of withstanding atomic blasts. \n\nThat Russia has been building these asylums under Moscow and the Ural Mountains since the cold war, shows longstanding preparation, but recent construction of more bunkers in conjunction with Russian air defense missiles being moved into Crimea, show that we could be on the precipice of a massive escalation of violence.\n\nPutin says that Russia needs to \"strengthen its defenses as an aggressive NATO approaches\". Just what sort of \"crisis\" or \"aggression\" is the Russian President expecting? Does he really expect things to escalate into a nuclear war? This pattern of conflagration and war across eastern Europe and the Caucasus region is nothing new to us.\n\nWe have watched as the Central Banking elites have used these incendiary war game tactics in an attempt to provoke armed conflict to further their agenda to consolidate global power and move toward world government.\n\nAnd, they have been using their mainstream media programming to deceive Westerners into thinking that Syrian president Bashar Al-assad has been using chemical weapons on his own people when in actuality it has been their globalist arbiters of war like Killary Clinton and Barack O'bomber undermining Assad's regime by supplying these noxious weapons to the so called \"Free Syrian Army\".\n\nWhile we don't always agree with Donald Trump, one thing he said that we think is pretty accurate is \"Obama is the founder of ISIS\". If by founder, Donald means supplier of weapons and materials then he is <a href=\"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/cia-weapons-syrian-jihadis-isis-selling-facebook/\">correct</a>. We find it interesting that the terror group Al-Nusra formerly known as Al- Qaeda in Syria, works shoulder to shoulder with the US funded \u00a0\"Free Syrian Army\" .\n\nIn war, the first thing to die is the truth. \u00a0(Just look at this actual State Department briefing... they aren't even trying to hide that it is obviously lies and propaganda anymore)\n\n<center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4Cs5TEjxtk</center>\n\nAnd what is occurring in Syria is no exception.\n\nAnd perhaps the most glaring untruth out there is a statement of omission. \u00a0Your average American has NO idea that any of this is even going on. \u00a0In fact, for the last week, all they\u2019ve been upset about is that a football player didn\u2019t stand up to their special song.\n\n<center>https://www.dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Special-Song-The-Dollar-Vigilante.jpg</center>\n\nAs we near the end day of the Jubilee Year on October 2nd, most of the world\u2019s major armies appear to be positioned. \u00a0Even inside the US, Jade Helm never ended, it was just renamed UWEX and people have just gotten used to seeing tanks and other major military equipment being transported across the country.\n\nRussia is preparing for an attack. \u00a0Germany, too. \u00a0It makes sense for you to also.\n\nAnd the best preparation are the investments we have been recommending at TDV: gold, silver, cryptocurrencies (we have even featured Steem in our last two issues) and other hard assets. \u00a0Our portfolio has been the best performing portfolio we know of in the financial newsletter space over the last year, gaining 200%.\n\nAnd it\u2019s because most aren\u2019t paying attention to the big picture. \u00a0Most have no idea what is going on. \u00a0And, most certainly are not prepared.\n\n<a href=\"http://dollarvigilante.com/subscribe\">Subscribe to The Dollar Vigilante newsletter</a> to make sure you aren\u2019t one of them.\n\n<center>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jeff-Berwick-The-Dollar-Vigilante-Steemit-Bio-1024x221.jpg</center>",

It is also one of China's art and cultural heritage treasures and is recognised of the progenitor acrobatics. Kunqu Opera is listed as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO since 2001.\n\nOriginating from the Suzhou area, Kunqu opera began it's life as a folk a Capella and soon become widespread in the southern areas of China. Kunqu opera is not only valued for it's vocals, but also it's literary content. It's merits have taken Kunqu to the highest peaks of Chinese operatic literature. \n\nOwing to the high degree of appreciation for Kunqu opera in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, it's development reached its peak around the 18th Century. It gradually declined in popularity up to the late Qing Dynasty, as more Kunqu performers turned to Beijing Opera instead.\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/q2R8a2c.jpg)\n\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u6606\u66f2\uff1f\n\u6606\u66f2\uff08Kun Opera\uff09\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u6700\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u5267\u79cd\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u5316\u827a\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u73cd\u54c1\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u767e\u620f\u4e4b\u7956\u7684\u79f0\u53f7\u3002\u6606\u66f2\u57282001\u5e74\u88ab\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u6559\u79d1\u6587\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5217\u4e3a\u201c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53e3\u8ff0\u548c\u975e\u7269\u8d28\u9057\u4ea7\u4ee3\u8868\u4f5c\u201d\u3002\u6606\u66f2\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u82cf\u5dde\u4e00\u5e26\uff0c\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u662f\u6c11\u95f4\u6e05\u5531\uff0c\u4f46\u4e4b\u540e\u6e10\u6e10\u6d41\u884c\u4e8e\u6574\u4e2a\u4e2d\u56fd\u5357\u65b9\u3002\u56e0\u4e3a\u6606\u66f2\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u58f0\u8154\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u5907\u6587\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u6606\u66f2\u7684\u6587\u5b66\u811a\u672c\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u620f\u66f2\u6587\u5b66\u7684\u4e00\u5ea7\u9ad8\u5cf0\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6606\u8154\u62e5\u6709\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u6b23\u8d4f\u5ea6\uff0c18\u4e16\u7eaa\u524d\u660e\u6e05\u65f6\u4ee3\u662f\u6606\u66f2\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u9f0e\u76db\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u5230\u4e86\u6e05\u4ee3\u665a\u671f\u9010\u6e10\u8d70\u5411\u6ca1\u843d\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u6606\u66f2\u5927\u5bb6\u5f00\u59cb\u8f6c\u5411\u4eac\u5267\u8868\u6f14\u3002\n\n#### Kunqu Opera's relation to Beijing Opera\nKunqu is known as the quintessence of Chinese Opera and is one of the firm foundations leading to Beijing Opera. Within a Beijing opera, there are many elements brought over from Kunqu, the vocals, and the acting style. In fact, every Beijing Opera performer must study and lay their foundations through Kunqu opera. \n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mfmtxHT.jpg)\n\u6606\u66f2\u4e0e\u4eac\u5267\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\n\u4eac\u5267\u88ab\u8a89\u4e3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u56fd\u7cb9\uff0c\u800c\u4e2d\u56fd\u620f\u66f2\u4e4b\u6bcd\u6606\u66f2\u5374\u662f\u4eac\u5267\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u4eac\u5267\u91cc\u9762\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u6606\u66f2\u5531\u8154\u548c\u6606\u66f2\u8868\u6f14\uff0c\u6606\u66f2\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u662f\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eac\u5267\u6f14\u5458\u5fc5\u5907\u7684\u3002\n\n#### Key features of Kunqu\n\nI've always been very interested in Kunqu Opera, from it's strong lyricism, to it's delicate dancing and singing. All elements combined to give a gracious and harmonious resonance. The overall coordination of these factors are what gives *Kunqu* it's beautiful picture. \n\n*Kunqu Opera* inherits much of it's dance from traditional folk dance and court dance. For a dancer like myself, I am fascinated by it's style and origin, for me, it is undoubtedly a great enjoyment as well as a learning process. \n\n*Kunqu* also carries with it an inherited Wu dialect which originated from the south. It is considered a pleasant and sweet sounding dialect, whether in narrative or scenery, spoken or sung, the dance is always coupled with the vocals for perfect compliment. The strong story driving the Kunqu is what fascinates many foreigners, many watching once and falling in love right away. \n\nAmereican Student learning Kunqu / \u7f8e\u56fd\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u6606\u66f2\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Mdp7rlM.jpg)\nCredit to [ncku.edu.tw]( http://web.ncku.edu.tw/files/16-1000-115044.php?Lang=en)\n\u6606\u66f2\u7684\u7279\u70b9\n\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u4e8e\u6b23\u8d4f\u6606\u66f2\u827a\u672f\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u6292\u60c5\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ec6\u817b\uff0c\u6b4c\u5531\u4e0e\u821e\u8e48\u7684\u8eab\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u5f97\u5de7\u5999\u800c\u8c10\u548c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u6574\u4f53\u914d\u5408\uff0c\u603b\u80fd\u8425\u9020\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u552f\u7f8e\u7684\u753b\u9762\u3002\u6606\u5267\u7684\u620f\u66f2\u821e\u8e48\u591a\u65b9\u5438\u6536\u548c\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86\u53e4\u4ee3\u6c11\u95f4\u821e\u8e48\u3001\u5bab\u5ef7\u821e\u8e48\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u559c\u6b22\u821e\u8e48\u7684\u6211\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u65e0\u7591\u662f\u83ab\u5927\u7684\u4eab\u53d7\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5b83\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5e26\u6709\u5434\u4fac\u8f6f\u8bed\u67d4\u548c\u7684\u5357\u65b9\u53e3\u97f3\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fd8\u662f\u5199\u666f\uff0c\u5ff5\u767d\u8bf4\u5531\u4e0e\u821e\u8e48\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6545\u4e8b\u6027\u975e\u5e38\u5f3a\uff0c\u5c31\u8fde\u4e0d\u5c11\u5916\u56fd\u53cb\u4eba\u90fd\u770b\u5f97\u6d25\u6d25\u6709\u5473\u751a\u81f3\u7231\u4e0a\u4e86\u6606\u66f2\u3002\n\n#### A visit to ***Nanke's Dream***\n\nI was very lucky to get an opportunity to come to the Beijing National Grand Theatre which is located west of Tiananmen Square in Central Beijing. This venue holds the highest regard amongst the Chinese national performing arts. It is also the largest Sino-foreign exchange platform serving as a base for the Chinese cultural and creative industries. \n\nThe building is oval shaped, and looks a bit like a spaceship, Because of it's quite uncanny appearance, it clashes with the surrounding environment and yet retains its eye catching qualities. Like a castle with a moat, it was built in the middle of the lake, and surrounded by water. It could be described as a pearl, other's will describe it like a shell. Whichever, the Grand Theatre itself, represents an end of an era, and the beginning of a new one.\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/pzep2pW.jpg)\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/98KjWsK.jpg)\n\u8d70\u8fdb\u300a\u5357\u67ef\u68a6\u8bb0\u300b\u7684\u68a6\u5e7b\u4eba\u751f\n\u8fd9\u4e00\u6b21\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u6765\u5230\u4e86\u5317\u4eac\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u5927\u5267\u9662\uff0c\u5b83\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5929\u5b89\u95e8\u5e7f\u573a\u897f\u4fa7\uff0c\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u8868\u6f14\u827a\u672f\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u6bbf\u5802\uff0c\u4e2d\u5916\u6587\u5316\u4ea4\u6d41\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u521b\u610f\u4ea7\u4e1a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u5730\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u5916\u5f62\u975e\u5e38\u7279\u522b\uff0c\u692d\u5706\u5916\u5f62\u5728\u957f\u5b89\u8857\u4e0a\u663e\u5f97\u50cf\u4e2a\u201c\u5929\u5916\u6765\u5ba2\u201d\uff0c\u4e0e\u5468\u906d\u73af\u5883\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u8ba9\u5b83\u663e\u5f97\u5341\u5206\u62a2\u773c\u3002\u5b83\u5efa\u5728\u6e56\u4e2d\u592e\uff0c\u8c61\u6e56\u4e2d\u660e\u73e0\uff0c\u53c8\u8c61\u201c\u86cb\u58f3\u201d\uff0c\u91cc\u9762\u5b55\u80b2\u7740\u751f\u547d\uff0c\u5927\u5267\u9662\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u4e0e\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\n\n***Nanke's Dream*** is the story of how it's main protagonist - ***Chunyu Fen***, fell asleep one day as he was drinking alcohol. Whilst asleep, he dreamt that he entered Huaian Empire where he became acquainted with the Ant Emperor as well as the emperor's daughter. The Ant Emperor offered his daughters hand in marriage to which *Chunyu Fen* could not refuse.. For he and the princess fell deeply in love. An so, for 20 years, *Chunyu Fen* was the governor of *Nanke* (a prosperous state of the empire), and lived a rich and glamorous life. Much later, the princess died, and *Chunyu Fen* gradually lost his influence and was eventually repatriated back from whence he came. *Chunyu Fen* suddenly awakes, only to realise that the last 20 years of his life, all the good as well as the grief and sorrow was all but a dream. *Chunyu Fen* finally understands the depths of love and hate in this world, but couldn't accept the fact that his princess was no longer of this world. This realisation empowered his decision to become a Buddhist. \n\nThis opera was written by the famous Ming Dynasty writer called ***Tang Xianzu*** and is one of his most recognised works. It's theme, dream and life is known as classical satire. \n\nThe stage design exudes neo-classical art and yet incorporates modern artistic flair. The Kunqu really leans on this aesthetic and uses it to maintain a fluid flow.\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Lyr0NuS.jpg)\nCredit to [3lian.com](http://www.3lian.com/gif/2014/10-17/63602.html)\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/yHNscdu.jpg)\n\u300a\u5357\u67ef\u68a6\u8bb0\u300b\u8bb2\u8ff0\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u9152\u9189\u540e\u201c\u5357\u67ef\u4e00\u68a6\u201d\u5165\u5927\u69d0\u5b89\u56fd\uff0c\u88ab\u8681\u738b\u53ec\u4e3a\u9a78\u9a6c\uff0c\u4e0e\u516c\u4e3b\u975e\u5e38\u6069\u7231\uff0c\u4e14\u4efb\u804c\u5357\u67ef\u90e1\u592a\u5b88\uff0c\u4e8c\u5341\u4f59\u5e74\u5386\u7ecf\u5bcc\u8d35\u8363\u534e\uff0c\u540e\u6765\u968f\u7740\u516c\u4e3b\u4ea1\u6545\uff0c\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u9010\u6e10\u5931\u53bb\u6743\u52bf\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u88ab\u9063\u8fd4\u56de\u5bb6\u3002\u540e\u6765\u5e61\u7136\u9192\u6765\uff0c\u624d\u77e5\u4e8c\u5341\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u6b23\u559c\u60b2\u54c0\u90fd\u4e0d\u8fc7\u662f\u5728\u505a\u68a6\u3002\u7537\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u4f53\u609f\u81ea\u5df1\u7231\u6068\u7684\u5206\u754c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6700\u540e\u9762\u5bf9\u516c\u4e3b\u7684\u4e0d\u820d\u4e0e\u6df1\u60c5\u540e\uff0c\u7ec8\u4e8e\u6709\u6240\u987f\u609f\uff0c\u7acb\u5730\u6210\u4f5b\u3002\u8be5\u5267\u662f\u660e\u4ee3\u8457\u540d\u620f\u66f2\u5bb6\u6c64\u663e\u7956\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u4f5c\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4ee5\u68a6\u5e7b\u5199\u4eba\u751f\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u90e8\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u8bbd\u4e16\u5267\u4f5c\u3002\u821e\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u7075\u5199\u610f\uff0c\u5c55\u5f00\u6606\u66f2\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u4e4b\u7f8e\u3002\n\n#### The costumes in ***Nanke's Dream***\n\nThe costumes worn by the actors are mostly hand embroidered. It's styles are inherited from traditional Kunqu Opera's, but have some degree of separation on design. The themes are primarily of China's traditional Celedon as well as Chinese traditional landscape paintings. The styles are what enable the viewer to really believe the Huaian dream state really exists. \n\nThe clothes all have landscapes with flowers as their recurring theme. On all the costumes, there was clever and careful consideration of colour used. This is because the patterns and colours must be auspicious but also exude a dream like state on stage. \n\u68a6\u5e7b\u822c\u7684\u300a\u5357\u67ef\u68a6\u8bb0\u300b\u670d\u88c5\n\u821e\u53f0\u4e0a\u6f14\u5458\u620f\u670d\u7684\u4e00\u9488\u4e00\u7ebf\u5927\u591a\u662f\u90a3\u7ee3\u5a18\u4eb2\u624b\u7ee3\u5236, \u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u7ee7\u627f\u4f20\u7edf\u620f\u66f2\u670d\u88c5\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u53e6\u8f9f\u8e4a\u5f84\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f20\u7edf\u9752\u74f7\u4e0e\u5c71\u6c34\u753b\u4e3a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u4e0d\u5c5e\u4e8e\u4eba\u4e16\u7684\u201c\u68a6\u5e7b\u69d0\u5b89\u201d\u7279\u8272\u3002\u4ee5\u5c71\u6c34\u82b1\u9e1f\u6784\u6210\u670d\u88c5\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5de7\u5999\u8fd0\u7528\u914d\u8272\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5409\u7965\u56fe\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u4ee4\u300a\u5357\u67ef\u68a6\u300b\u7684\u821e\u53f0\u8272\u5f69\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u7740\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53e4\u5178\u97f5\u5473\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u201c\u7f8e\u68a6\u201d\u822c\u7684\u7eda\u4e3d\u591a\u59ff\u3002\n\nCeledon costume / \u9752\u74f7\u670d\u9970\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/a7ADbiw.jpg)\nCredit to [3lian.com](http://www.3lian.com/gif/2014/10-17/63602.html)\n\nLandscape paintings on the opera costumes / \u620f\u670d\u4e0a\u7684\u5c71\u6c34\u753b\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/nuEom5O.jpg)\nCredit to [3lian.com](http://www.3lian.com/gif/2014/10-17/63602.html)\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/d1A3qB0.jpg)\nCredit to [yczihua.com](http://www.yczihua.com/article-14918.html)\n\nSilk Yarn hand embroidered in various flower patterns all over the cloak. \nCombined with light pink and an embroidered pleated skirt, this outfit is tender yet beautiful.\n\u7528\u4e1d\u7ebf\u7efd\u653e\u7684\u82b1\u6735\u523a\u7ee3\u5728\u7c89\u8272\u6597\u7bf7\u4e0a\uff0c\u914d\u6de1\u7c89\u8272\u523a\u7ee3\u767e\u8936\u88d9\u5f88\u5a07\u8273\u3002\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/36rDsBP.jpg)\nCredit to [3lian.com](http://www.3lian.com/gif/2014/10-17/63602.html)\n\nA blue base with grass embroidery and white collar.

Namely, the Latin *\"stare\"* which means \"to stand.\" Now, think of the words \"stagnant\" or \"static.\" These words are all interrelated.\nWhat they have in common is clearly seen:\n\n**NOTHING IS MOVING.**\n\n**It truly is a sad *state* of affairs. The state hates movement, hates innovation, and hates progress.** How do I know? Well, if it is not easy enough to decipher already, let's look at three fields where true progress in innovation is basically grinding to a halt under state \"supervision.\" This \"supervision\" is killing the *real vision* which always benefits humanity insofar as it is allowed to flourish.\n\n**The three areas are:**\n\n**1.

Arguably the greatest inventor/scientific mind of the late 19th, early 20th century--dies alone, penniless, and talking to birds. No matter he was working to, and claimed to have found, a way to extract free, ambient energy from the air. The Rockefellers, Edisons, and Morgans, would not hear of it. No funding for you, Nik!\n\nWhy was there no funding for Tesla? In a nutshell, it was because the state was interested in maintaining a violent monopoly on the production of power, so they could continue to stuff their faces with the finest foods and travel the world, while laughing at the likes of you and I, working until we die to pay for access to their shitty fossil fuels and crudely primitive sources for energy and power.\n\n>Morgan could easily see that Tesla\u2019s main motivation was not to make money. Rather it was to emancipate humanity with new forms of technology that would liberate people from darkness, drudgery, and various forms of top-down oppression. Neither Morgan nor the class he represented shared Tesla\u2019s goal of conducting research and development to make life easier and better in ways that operate within, rather than against, prevailing patterns of nature, including what is best in human nature.\n[SOURCE](http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/04/22/prophet-or-profit-nikola-teslas-vision-vs-j-p-morgans-greed/)\n\n**RESOURCES:**\nhttp://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_todre.html\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transfer\n\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/fe74390xv/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s21.postimg.org/4elwrnaiv/image.jpg' border='0' alt='image'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/app.php'>\n## The Arts ##\n\n**My whole reason for posting. I read an interesting quote by film director Francis Ford Coppola just yesterday:**\n\n>You have to remember that it\u2019s only a few hundred years, if that much, that artists are working with money. Artists never got money. Artists had a patron, either the leader of the state or the duke of Weimar or somewhere, or the church, the pope. Or they had another job. I have another job. I make films. No one tells me what to do. But I make the money in the wine industry. You work another job and get up at five in the morning and write your script.\nThis idea of Metallica or some rock n\u2019 roll singer being rich, that\u2019s not necessarily going to happen anymore. Because, as we enter into a new age, maybe art will be free. Maybe the students are right. They should be able to download music and movies. I\u2019m going to be shot for saying this. But who said art has to cost money? And therefore, who says artists have to make money?\n[SOURCE](http://99u.com/articles/6973/francis-ford-coppola-on-risk-money-craft-collaboration)\n\n**Well, how do you feel? Do *you* want to shoot him? I don't. I think his answer here is dead on.** I am all for artists being paid. In fact, that is one of the main reasons I am on Steemit.com. However, as an anarchist, and as one who has given a substantial amount of thought to the matter, I do not support IP (intellectual property) \"rights.\" These reasons why I do not can be basically summed up in [this article](https://steemit.com/anarchism/@jaredhowe/intellectual-property-a-government-protected-monopoly) by @jaredhowe.\n\nWhat I am getting at here is that real artists, paid for the art or not, are going to create. However, for anyone who has ever read George Orwell's *Keep the Aspidistra Flying* it is clear that some modicum of sustenance (food in belly, clothes on back, roof over head) are necessary for creation to really take place. I quote Orwell from the aforementioned title here:\n\n>The next seven months were devastating. They scared him and almost broke his spirit. He learned what it means to live for weeks on end on bread and margarine, to try to \u2018write\u2019 when you are half starved, to pawn your clothes, to sneak trembling up the stairs when you owe three weeks\u2019 rent and your landlady is listening for you. Moreover, in those seven months he wrote practically nothing. The first effect of poverty is that it kills thought. He grasped, as though it were a new discovery, that you do not escape from money merely by being moneyless. On the contrary, you are the hopeless slave of money until you have enough of it to live on\u2015a \u2018competence\u2019, as the beastly middle-class phrase goes.\n\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/hvr7ls1cr/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s9.postimg.org/6w60a6axr/1430395863q3fi8.jpg' border='0' alt='1430395863q3fi8'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/'>\n\n**So, this is it. Without money, creation is stifled. Without money, people become selfish (naturally). Without money, fear sets in.**\n\n( As a brief aside, I would also like to recommend W. Somerset Maugham's *The Summing Up* as an excellent exploration of this idea. Maugham wrote this book toward the end of his life as a kind of final statement, and self-declaration, and in it he talks much of how success, to the contrary of what society says and teaches, did not make him greedy, haughty, uncreative and unfeeling, but on the contrary seemed to engender compassion, creativity, and long suffering for others in him.)\n\n\n\n# Without the State, Money Flows #\n\nMaybe you are an artist working as a carpenter, daytime. Maybe you do landscaping. Maybe you are a garbage man symphony composer burning the midnight oil in unpredictable feverish heats of creative passion. There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with working a \"day job,\" is there? Sure, we should all strive to do what we love, and to do it ALL THE TIME. I'm a believer in that. If it wasn't what we were \"meant to do\" why would we be doing it for no pay, no glory, and no legacy, other than that of our own personal satisfaction? \n\n**My main point in writing this is that, without all the restrictive--and maybe, more accurately, *constrictive*--red tape, meaningless legislation, bureaucratic fines, fees, licenses, taxes, and guns to your head to enforce them, you would probably have more money, and thus, more time, energy, resources, compassion and flow to dedicate to your art.**\n\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/ksywo2yvl/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s16.postimg.org/g72sfqdcl/band.jpg' border='0' alt='band'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/'>*A picture I drew of my former band, on which I spent thousands of dollars and got nothing in return but a personal satisfaction. Namely, the transmission of myself via sounds, music, and words to others, and the joy of connecting with my fellow humans on a profound level through self-expression.*\n\n# Anarchism, Art, and Order #\n\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/502b757ib/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s21.postimg.org/n2vdyd3d3/anarchy.jpg' border='0' alt='anarchy'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/'>\n\n**If you are an anarchist you likely know the overwhelming feeling of dread and fear that sometimes hits.** I've got a stomachache right now because of it. It feels as if there is no way out. Behind on medical bills, behind on taxes, behind on absolutely everything and your whole life you have been told that this is normal:\n\n**to burn yourself out, and slave each moment of existence *just to pay a thief,* is *normal.***\n\n**Enough is enough.**\n\n**Can you imagine how beautiful the world could be without a state?**\n\nBeautiful gardens being grown, medicine being made and technology being advanced at light-speed now that the lobbyists are gone.\n\nNow that everyone is armed, we laugh at those who would say \"stop resisting\" when they try to uproot plants from our gardens, forests and fields. Community organizations come to your aid. The bully who used to throw people in cages is now, ostracized caged or *killed himself* should he try to violate the rights or take the life of another peaceful human being.\n\nCan you imagine the paintings, the murals, the sculptures viewed from modern, high-speed roadways standing stories tall, of boys and girls playing, of great men and women of science, instead of the grotesque statues of communist leaders or child-murdering, dictatorial thieves?\n\n**This is my world.**\n\n**I live in this world already.**\n\n**Will you be there, too?**\n\n~KafkA\n***\n*Graham Smith is a Voluntaryist activist residing in Niigata, Japan.*\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/q3u5ej98r/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s17.postimg.org/hlkpa72q7/13615500_730504890423605_1425702647400253724_n.jpg' border='0' alt='13615500_730504890423605_1425702647400253724_n'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/'>",

    "body": "<center>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/JeffBerwicktheDollarVigilanteandHeidiTravelsonSteemit81e02.jpg</center>\n\nAs @heiditravels recently recounted (<a href=\"https://steemit.com/travel/@heiditravels/a-chance-encounter-with-the-dollar-vigilante-jeff-berwick\">A Chance Encounter With The Dollar Vigilante: Jeff Berwick</a>) the stars seemed to align for a chance meeting between the two of us in Miami a few days ago.\n\nI was just passing through the USSA for as short of a time as possible (it's too much of a police state and too unfree for my liking) <a href=\"https://steemit.com/money/@dollarvigilante/why-i-left-canada-and-became-a-citizen-of-the-dominican-republic\">on my way to the Dominican Republic to become a citizen</a> and we managed to meet up.\n\nHer story is quite fascinating.  Less than two months ago she only dreamed of living a life of world travel and adventure.  She had just saved up for her first big trip and was in Tahiti when she began to post on Steemit about it... and the Steem dollars began to flow in.  Now she is living the Steem Dream and was just packing for her trip to Africa to swim with great white sharks... all funded by Steem.\n\nI asked her all about it, and more, and you can see it exclusively on Steemit (it is unlisted on Youtube) here:\n\n<center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFcnzicNcV8</center>\n\n50% of all Steem dollars generated by this post will be transferred (and publicly verifiable by viewing my wallet) to @heiditravels .  That's just another really cool use of Steemit... if you get good content by interviewing or working with other people you can easily, and verifiably, transfer whatever percentage of the Steem dollars you like to that person, or to a charity, or whatever you like.\n\nStay tuned and follow me here at @dollarvigilante as I've got another Steem Exclusive coming up in the next few days with another Steemian... one of the most famous big wave surfers in the world.\n\n<center>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jeff-Berwick-The-Dollar-Vigilante-Steemit-Bio-1024x221.jpg</center>",

    "body": "# Today i decided to stop my regular job and become a fulltime Steem developer/curator/contributor. \n\n### A risky move considering i'm no whale at all, and at it's best, a powerdown would only generate around 75$ a week. \n\nhttps://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAVdAAAAJDI3NWIyOTA0LWY4MjUtNDQ3ZC1iNTFhLTI4OGMxYTE1NWI3NQ.jpg\n\nI found myself working every spare minute on steem related projects. Mainly, Steempay.io and it's side projects, as well as helping others and teaming up to handle bigger projects. All of this is a very time and energy consuming process. \n\nCombining this with my regular day job, got me up to a point where i'm in need of time. \nTime for my family, time for my kids, time to relax, time to eat, time to sleep.\n\nMy life savings are enough to cover for the next few months focusing on nothing but Steem. At this point, i've generated some nice rewards, but every SBD i've made has been invested in the growth, quality and productivity of my work and work enviroment. \n\nThis may sounds like a bad idea - and it probably will be - but I want to let my creativity flow free without being forced to get up for work. At the same time, this will force me to deliver outstanding and unique products for this platform to have a minor source of income. \n\nI'm aware that i may regret this decission some day, but hey. **Productivity before brains!**\n\nYou can support me by voting me as a steem witness ([SEE LINK](https://steemit.com/witness-category/@steve-walschot/witness-application-post-steve-walschot-creator-of-steempay)) or simply by following me and upvoting my posts if you like them enough!\n\n## Let's see how this plays out :-)",

    "body": "<center>https://s5.postimg.org/ii6534gs7/feature_thumbnail.png</center>\nExcited to announce eSteem v1.1.6 updates, that is published today.  After [iOS v1.0.0 release](https://steemit.com/steemmobile/@good-karma/finally-esteem-is-on-ios-app-store-other-development-updates), I have pushed next batch of updates for iOS Appstore Review.

It is super easy, you just open any post you want and bookmark it from top right corner. Remove bookmarking can be done from same page or menu has Bookmarks page where you can open post or swipe left to remove it from Bookmarks.\n<center>https://s5.postimg.org/jdxklgk53/bookmarks.png</center>\n\ud83d\udd25 **New added sort trend Promoted**\n<center>https://s5.postimg.org/lxt7fk7p3/promoted.png</center>\n# Improvements\n\ud83d\udd25 Login page refinement\n<center>https://s5.postimg.org/rai1tovlj/login.png</center>\n\ud83d\udd25 Profile picture, better formatting on blockchain, with consensus of some Steem devs!\n\ud83d\udd25 Markdown improvements\n\ud83d\udd25 Layout updates\n# iOS (v1.1.8)\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1141397898&mt=8\nVersion 1.1.5 was submitted for AppStore review on \ud83d\udd50_27th Aug 2016_, should be available soon after review is done. \n# Google Play (1.1.6)\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netsolutions.esteem\n\n# Future plans\nMoving forward, focus will be to increase user base of the Steem platform as a whole.

A worse thing is that posts per user is dramatically decreasing. This means that users are not enjoying this platform and may leave to other attractive platform very easily. What makes these outputs?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.postimg.io/bzlvi7qlf/trend.png\" width=\"1047\" height=\"631\"/></p>\n<p>(Image source: @atomrigs 's <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@atomrigs/attention-whales-it-is-time-for-your-action\">post</a>)</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Although Steemit sounds very promising, as advertised \"post it and earn reward\", the reality to regular users is very disappointing. Many of them only got below $0.1 regardless of their efforts on the posts. Obviously there were some junk posts and copy-paste things, but some maybe really worth to be rewarded. I think that there are two main reasons. First, whales are few and they can read a very small number of posts. Undiscovered posts by whales sometimes get over a hundred upvotes but the reward is still below $0.1. Second, reward system is too biased. As mentioned in the white paper, the reward system is bench-marking a casino scheme. But statistics and user experiences so far may tell this is wrong. We should remind that while a few jackpot winners are very happy, many losers are desperate and sometimes give up their lives. The similar thing is happening now in Steemit.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Then what should we do? I want to suggest three points.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>1. Limit whales voting power at a certain percentage of total Steem Power</h2>\n<p>(Original idea is from @slowwalker 's <a href=\"https://steemit.com/kr/@slowwalker/3zcizz\">post</a>)</p>\n<p>For instance, we can restrict whales voting power at 0.1%. Then if a whale have 5,000 SP out of 500,000 (1.0%), he has the same power with those who has 500 SP (0.1%), but he can vote 10 times more at the full rate. This may cause some whales to split accounts, but this splitting for increasing voting power can be considered as an abuse given the system. This suggestion can make dolphins stronger and results in more distributed power system.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>2. Reduce biases in the reward system</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgsafe.org/9eb18e1.png\" width=\"630\" height=\"465\"/></p>\n<p>Currently the parameter is 2.0 (square) and it brings in a very high head and long tail. But what we need is thick tail. We need to test and simulate other parameters between 1 and 2, focusing on some socially meaningful measurements (e.g. median payout, mode payout bracket, 90/10 ratio, <a href=\"https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/how-economic-inequality-defined\">etc</a>). Do not undervalue seemingly-worthless posts. If we can make people happy and retain them, the reward is not a waste. Remember that attracting new user also costs, and ex-users are very very hard to bring back.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>3. Reputation-based display should be default</h2>\n<p>Although payout-based sorting has some importance in terms of system security and users' perception, it's side-effect is also significant - a feeling of inequality. I would suggest a reputation-based display page as a default. People are able to have more influence without having a great amount of money, so that everyone can dream about becoming an important person in this platform. If needed, we surely have to develop better reputation system.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Steemit is mainly a SNS, not a marketplace nor a gambling system. Our first goal should be making as many people happier, then those people will make us succeed. I would really appreciate to developers who are working very hard under the water and many friends who give bitter advises for Steemit.</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<center>https://s25.postimg.org/r3xo3fhhb/living_without_eating.jpg</center>\n\nFeasting on the bounty of the sun; forty four minutes of direct sun gazing each day for spiritual and biological nourishment along with subsistence on water, air and love so the body can metabolize all the nutrients it needs and sustain oneself off the Hindu vital life force, *Prana*. \n\nIt is an international movement of people who believe true health can only be achieved by giving up all solid food and subsisting only on energy, light and in some cases water.\n\nWelcome to the subculture of the Breathairian.\n\n### A Brief History of Breathairians\n\n<center>https://s25.postimg.org/g0i6s74n3/knowledge_1052011__180.jpg</center>\n\nModern Brethairianism is not a novel and unique invention of modern day subculture. The roots of extreme fasting, and by extension Bretharianism, can be traced back to the 1670s Rosicrucian Enlightenment Movement. In the Rosicrucian text *Comte de Gabalis*, extended fasting and renunciation of food and water is attributed to a 16th century physician and occultist, Paracelsus who was said to have lived, \u201c\u2026several years by taking only one half scruple of Solar Quintessence.\u201d\n\n**The Rise of Breathairianism to the Minstream**\n\nThe Brethairian Institute of America was founded by Wiley Brooks in the early 1980s, after he appeared on the American Television Show, *That\u2019s Incredible!*. This spawned an entire subculture with Jasmuheen rising to the fore in 1990, claiming she could go for month and months without anything but a cup of tea. In 1999, she was featured on the television news series 60 minutes. \n\nHira Ratan Manek has laid claims he has subsisted only regular sungazing in addition to  water and occasionally tea, coffee and buttermilk since 1995.\n\nPrahlad Janti was an Indian sadhu, who claimed both that he had managed to live for 70 years without food or water and claimed he was investigated by doctors in both 2003 and in 2010.\n\nBreathairianism has also laid claim to main stream celebrities. Michelle Pfeiffer, during an interview for The Sunday Telegraph\u2019s Stella Magazine, revealed after moving to Los Angeles at the age of 20, she was swept up into the subculture. While filming the movie, The Moonies (about the Reverend Moon Sun-Myung\u2019s Unification Church), \u201c\u2026she said that while she was helping him with research \u2018on this cult\u2019 she realized: \u2018I was in one.\u2019\u201d Madonna was reportedly a practitioner of Breathairianism as well.\n\n**Leadership Hypocrisy and the Fall of Breathairianism to the Fringe**\n\nIn every movement steeped in deep spirituality, a question of conviction arises at some point. Breathairianism would be no different. The personalities most key to the rise of this subculture would hold the keys to the fall of this subculture and its relegation to a fringe cult.\n\nAfter **Wiley Brooks** reportedly left a Santa Cruz 7-Eleven with a Slurpee, a hot dog and some Twinkies in 1983, the Breathairian Institute of America suffered mass resignations within the organization. Wiley Brooks subsequently modified the central tenant of the Brethairian subculture and on the 5D Q & A section of his website Mr. Brooks stated that,\n\n*\u201c\u2026 cows are fifth-dimensional (or higher) beings that help mankind achieve fifth-dimensional status by converting three-dimensional food to five-dimensional food (beef).\u201d*\n\nLater in the same section of the website, Mr. Brooks went into further detail regarding the special properties of the McDonalds Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese and Diet Coke,\n\n*\u201c\u2026the \u2018Double Quarter-Pounder with Cheese\u2019 meal from McDonald's possesses a special \u2018base frequency\u2019 and that he thus recommends it as occasional food for beginning [B]reatharians. He then goes on to reveal that Diet Coke is \u2018liquid light\u2019. Prospective disciples are asked after some time following the junk food/magic word preparation to revisit his website in order to test if they can feel the magic.\u201d*\n\n I think McDonalds coined the phrase, \u201cBig Mac Attack\u201d for that 5D base frequency. \n\nDuring that 60 minutes interview with **Jasmuheen**, interviewers discovered her house was stocked with food. She claimed the food was for her husband and daughter. She was subsequently monitored by the 60 minutes crew for a one week period. By day 3, she was having difficulty and asked to be moved from the city, blaming polluted air as the reason she could not absorb nutrients. \n\nThe crew relocated her to the countryside, and by the fourth day Doctor Berris Wink of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association had to stop the test, due to severe dehydration (about 11%) and threat of kidney failure. \n\nOn the positive side, Jasmuheen was awarded the Bent Spoon Award by Australian Skeptics in 2000. The award is presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle.\n\n**Hira Ratan Manek** was caught on camera, in the 2011 documentary *Eat the Sun* feasting on a large meal in a San Francisco restaurant and questions would swirl around the \u201cresults\u201d of the tests from **Prahlad Janti**. It was discovered he was allowed to meet with devotees, leave the sealed test room to sunbathe and move out of the view of the CCTV camera views at certain points during the experiment.\n\nIn the immortal words of Darth Vader, a Jedi devotee, \u201cI find your lack of faith disturbing.\u201d\n\n**The Second Coming of Breathairianism**\n\n<center>https://s25.postimg.org/b4f0jvlfj/breatharian_barbie.jpg</center>\n\nAfter being relegated to second tier cults (below cults such as The Heaven\u2019s Gate Society and Aum Shinrikyo), in recent times, the subculture has experienced a rebirth and received a spokesperson in living doll, Valeria Lukyanova- The Human Barbie. \n\nWith her endorsement and the explosion of social media, Breathairianism had a small rebirth within a niche fringe movement of pro-anorexia.\n\n### What exactly are Breathairians? \n\n<center>https://s25.postimg.org/ia6rmbuin/Breatharian_Diet.jpg</center>\n\nThere is a long and deep history of voluntary fasting across all strata of religion with varying rules. The single, unifying thread is the voluntary fast is temporary for very specific spiritual significance or for political reasons, such as a hunger strike out of protest. The key difference with the Breathairian subculture is the period of voluntary fast is for the complete life of the individual.\n\n**The Dark Side of Breathairianism and Its Endorsement by the Pro-Anroexia Nervousa Subculture**\n\nThroughout the pro-anorexia community, forums are dedicated to the Bretharian subculture. The popular belief appears to be Breathairianism has revealed humans do not consume food for nutritional value, but rather it serves only to provide pleasure and sensation. \n\nIt would appear the consensus belief is,\n\n*\u201cBreathairianism is about having the choice of whether to eat or not to eat. To never hunger or starve when food is not around, to never feel dependency or attachment to food, and to have found what is there once food is no longer in the way of our perception and focus. This is what Breatharianism is about. True happiness, and a full freedom of choices. To feel fully alive, safe, independent, and happy.\u201d*\n\nFrightening.\n\n**The Brethairian Subculture in the Media**\n\nThe Breathairian subculture has received some mainstream media attention over the years:\n\n* **VICE Media**, March 16, 2014 (http://www.vice.com/read/breatharian-leader-wiley-brooks-lives-on-light-air-and-quarter-pounders) \n* **The Daily Beast**, March 2, 2014 (http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/02/introducing-breatharianism-the-dumbest-diet-of-all-time.html) \n* **Esquire Magazine**, February 28, 2014 (http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a27563/human-barbies-are-coming-with-diet/) \n* **The Inquisitr**, November 5, 2013 (http://www.inquisitr.com/1019725/breatharianism-cult-leader-jasmuheen-advocates-living-without-food-or-water-but-why/) \n* **LiveScience**, May 10, 2010 (http://www.livescience.com/8224-indian-mystic-claims-eat-70-years.html) \n* **The Guardian**, September 28, 1999 (https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/sep/28/millennium.uk) \n\nOut of respect for how deeply linked this subculture is with pro-anorexia nervosa and the danger of extreme fasting, I will not perform an analysis of, or include links to, social media or marketplaces which would perpetuate this subculture.\n\n### References\n\nWikipedia. \u201cInedia.\u201d August 29, 2016. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inedia\n\nBrooks, Wiley. \u201cBreathairian Institute of America.

    "body": "Hi friends, today I propose to make caviar! Yes, you heard right, make caviar! This idea came to me after a personal note (after my first upvote of @dollarvigilante) : I imagined the different destinations and the restaurants where went the @dollarvigilante, these places where they serve the best food, but also caviar !!!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Salut les amis, aujourd'hui je propose de faire du caviar ! Oui vous avez bien entendu, faire du caviar!*\n*Cette id\u00e9e m'est venu apr\u00e8s une remarque personnel suite \u00e0 mon premier upvote de @dollarvigilante*  : *j'imagin\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rentes destinations et les restaurants o\u00f9 va le @dollarvigilante, des endroits o\u00f9 l'on sert les meilleurs plats,* mais *aussi du caviar !!!* \n\n![](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/37/1473682632-imag2096.jpg)\n\nAnd the idea of this article had become obvious : I give you how to make caviar with a technique of molecular cooking to everyone. Anyone can do it in the kitchen and all that is required is that very easily.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Et puis l'id\u00e9e de cette article \u00e9tait devenu une \u00e9vidence :  je vous donne la fa\u00e7on de faire du caviar avec* *une technique de cuisine mol\u00e9culaire \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de tous. Tout le monde peut le faire dans sa cuisine et* *tout ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire ce trouve tr\u00e8s facilement.*\n\n> The term caviar corresponds to the fact to transform a liquid into small beads that give the appearance or illusion of a real caviar.\n*Le terme caviar correspond au fait de transformer un liquide en petites billes qui donnerons l'apparence* *ou l'illusion d'avoir un vrai caviar.*\n\nIn this recipe I made chocolate, but you can give you pleasure in replacing chocolate with a red fruit, coffee or vegetable, let your imagination soar!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Dans cette recette j'ai pris du chocolat, mais vous pourrait vous faire plaisir rempla\u00e7ant le chocolat par un* *fruit rouge, du caf\u00e9 ou un l\u00e9gume, laisser votre imagination s'exprimer !*\n\nWe start by taking everything one needs. :\n--------------------------------------------\n*On commence en r\u00e9unissant tous ce dont on a besoin :*\n\n![](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/37/1473681352-55.jpg)\n\nEverything is mixed, at the same time, cook (without stirring constantly) and stops when there is the first bubbles of boiling.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*On m\u00e9lange le tout en m\u00eame temps, on fait cuire (sans jamais arr\u00eater de remuer) et on arr\u00eate quand il y a les premiers bulles d\u2019\u00e9bullition.* \n\n![](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/37/1473681356--.jpg)\n\nNow let cool a few minutes and in the meantime, put oil in a glass. Take any oils other than rapeseed.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Maintenant laisser refroidir quelques minutes et pendant ce temps, on mets de l'huile dans un r\u00e9cipient. On peut prendre toute les huiles sauf celle au colza.* \n\n> ![](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/37/1473681373-imag1981.jpg)\nI took a very big glass so you can see well, but this is not necessary, a simple glass will do.\n*J'ai pris un tr\u00e8s grand verre pour que vous puissiez bien voir, mais ce n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, un simple verre suffit.*\n\n\nAlors on va prendre le materiel n\u00e9cessaire, c'est \u00e0 dire une seringue. Ce qui compte c'est le trou de de la seringue ne soit pas trop petit. Moi, par exemple, j'ai pris celle du sirop pour enfant.\nSo we will take the necessary equipment: a syringe.

    "body": "#### Summary: Steem solves one key monetization issue of the internet by creating a new way of paying for content via dilution of its coin supply. This requires organic growth similar to the dilution percentage or higher if the ecosystem is to not deflate. Recently Bounties have been introduced to finance certain initiatives on steem. However I believe this misses the strategic potential of the tool. Bounties could be used to create cash-inflows that will allow growth and value without sending away value of the ecosystem. Instead of just giving money to content creators via a set dilution budget everyday, we can allow users to ask question or support certain topics by adding bounties to their posts. Users might do this because they are seeking a certain type of content. Anyone could ask the internet a question, put a bounty on it and the world would compete for the best answer. As such bounties could be a whole new way information exchange on the internet can be rewarded. By implementing bounties the right way, steem can create one more new monetization layer for the internet and become much more valuable than just with one way of monetizing its content.\n\n#### The recently proposed bounty system falls short of its potential for steem. I want to outline why bounties can be a game changer for the internet and how steem could implement them for mutual benefit.\n\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/Qmc4RuamRq4g6qRoemtcSDz6cZ1CQYqY8VoBEZ3WyugDt7'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/Qmc4RuamRq4g6qRoemtcSDz6cZ1CQYqY8VoBEZ3WyugDt7'/></a>\n[Photo by pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/dog-eat-biscuit-reward-843800/)\n\n\n# The monetization issue of the internet\n\nThe internet has a monetization issue. There are pretty much three ways content is monetized:\n\n- Ad model: sites provide advertisement and every view is worth a tiny amount of money. For instance 1000 minutes on youtube tends to be wort about $1  or even less. \n- Subscription: because the above only works for very cheap and mass media content well there are subscription where customer may pay a monthly fee: examples are Netflix or poker training site.\n- Pay per View: customer pay for a particular content such as a movie or news article.\n\nAll of these monetizations have issues. The ad model only works if your content is valuable for a mass audience and ads are annoying. Some people also hate the way sites like google and Facebook are using private data of their customers. The subscription makes it hard for people to sign up, because it creates a monthly bill and once customers have signed up you are stuck with a limit to your revenue. Pay per view has the challenge that many people are used to getting their content for free and create a barrier to consume it because of its price. Subsriptions and pay per view additionally have the problem of having a planned price, while we know planning the correct price leads always to a sub-optimal solution.\n\n# The limit of the internet with bad monetization\nThe internet connects everyone in the world and should make it easy for any information to float freely. However that is not the case. The reason is that while information can be exchanged freely value cannot be exchanged so easily. This is because to provide information to the web, it only makes sense if it fits into the limited monetization channels described above. You may still need to consult regular specialist when having an advanced or specific question. You can't ask the internet to solve a problem for you, unless it is something simple that some nice guy or gal will answer for you on a forum like reddit or if many people have the exact same question.\n\nThe internet needs a better way to exchange information for value via an efficient market for content and information. Imagine you want to go on a trip and want to know what is the best way to vacation for you personally at a wonderful spot like Machu Picchu. You can ask @heiditravels since she has been there in the comments of one of her post, but she is likely going to give you an artificial answer, because consulting you on how to travel there requires work and understanding your requirements. So you probably have to research this yourself by reading articles, books and finding youtube videos that help you. This is all much easier because of the internet, but still the internet does not allow you to actually get a direct exchange of information for you, even if you are willing to pay for it. I had this problem last year when I visited the Galapagos and the fact that I did not know certain things cost me a bit of money, because the way I booked things was not optimal. I.e. I should have booked my day trips on the island instead of going through my travel agency in the US. I also could have saved money 1/2 of the cost by booking the boat cruise on the island, I just did not know this was possible.\n\nSubscription, pay per view and ad based monetization suffer from the fact that only content that happens to be as valuable as many people are ready to pay for it can be exchanged fluidly. That means instead of the market determining the price of content, the information that is the right price finds its way to the internet. The rest of the knowledge we hold stays away. It does not fit the rigid and limited pricing model of the internet.\n\nAs a result most of our knowledge actually does not get exchanged via the internet because there is no good way of valuing that exchange. Imagine what untapped potential the internet has. In other words what would happen if you could just ask the internet for any information or question and it would spit it out for the right price. \n\n\"For the right price\" has not been implemented and thus most of the stuff you can find on the internet is not that valuable, unless it is to help you generate revenue for someone else (like specification of a product) or concerns the masses (news) or cost what many people want to pay for it (blockbuster movie).\n \n# The problem steemit solved and did not solve\n\nSteemit is an amazing solution to the broadcasting of mass information. It has solved the problem of rewarding and paying for content without needing ads, subscription or payments. That is an amazing accomplishment. I have written several articles here and brought some friends to this site that have also written articles, they would have otherwise not published. It allows content to be valued if people appreciate it, instead of if they click on banners, which is a much more direct and better way of exchanging  value. I'd be surprised if many news outlets are either not going to be put out of business by steem or are going to adopt steem somehow in the next few years.\n\nHowever steem still requires a certain amount of people to like content. For instance if you know something that is really valuable for one person on steemit, you will not get  rewarded, even if the information is very valuable to few. So why bother, or give it away when you can probably charge for it? However if you write something that many people like, you will be rewarded very well. So steem in its current form still only works for content of a certain price, that many people want to consume. Of course the whale aspect changes this a bit, but not fundamentally.\n\n# Bounties can be a new way of monetizing the internet\nTo make steem more powerful in this regard we can use bounties. Because bounties can be set at different price levels we can now value content higher, even if only one person needs or wants the information. \n\nSo back to my question of how to best vacation at Machu Picchu: I can ask the question on steem and will probably not get many upvotes to my question. Because it is not very valuable content for many. I will probably also not get the greatest answers because my vote alone won't entice people to do the work of answering my question. However if I put a bounty on my question this changes the game fundamentally. People that can answer the question will now compete for the bounty and thus will have to put effort into providing a good answer. If a good answer will likely safe me a few hundred dollars, why not put this question on steem with a $100 or $200 bounty? The difference is that it used to be smart not to provide an answer, while now it is profitable to provide information.\n\nBounties could also be used to promote certain topics. I.e. if steem wanted to generate a certain type of content like i.e. cat-videos, there could be a bounty on cat-videos. The creators would get additional rewards, in addition to all the existing people that love cat-videos on steem and therefore would vote for them anyway, and thus would be enticed to publish even more cat videos on steem. This could then attract new cat lover users and generate growth for steem.\n\nBounties could be a great way to support the creation of new communities on steam. For instance if we wanted to have daily bitcoin chart analysis on steem and bring traders onto the site, this could be facilitated with the creation of a specific tag and corresponding bounty for traders.\n\nThe difference of this ad campaign would be that instead of giving value to an outside eco-system like google we would grow the steem economy by creating internal value (the money creators will receive from the bounties) instead of burning the marketing budget to some external service.\n\n# Steemit needs cash-inflow\nSteem gives content providers rewards. It pays for these rewards by creating more coins, which dilutes the value of the existing coin holders. In order for the economy to be sustainable, cash-inflow is required to be higher or at least similar to this outflow of money. The balance of these two forces happens via an exchange market. New investors or users of steem buy steem tokens to either power them up or use them otherwise, while content creators tend to cash out at least some of the coins they receive. In addition existing coin holders may also decide to liquidate their steem by selling. In short we need new users or investments to join the ecosystem and buy coins in order for it to not deflate, due to the cash-outflows generated by the reward system continuously. Investors are banking on the fact that the money they put into the system will attract content that is more valuable than the money they are investing and thus will create a positive ROI. \n\nIn addition to the inflow via investments, steem has also just recently created a way to create inflows via promotions. Since the money used to promote post gets burned and thereby reduces the coin supply, it effectively creates cash-inflow to the ecosystem. \n\nBounties would create yet another channel of cash-inflows, since users would directly give other users money without going thru the cycle of investment which has to attract great content that will attract more users, which will invest more to overall grow the steem economy. You can see how that a bounty system would create a financial cycle that would be much more direct.\n\nBoth the promotional cash and the bounty cash will have a much more immediate effect and ROI and thus the flow of money and new users will likely be easier. Overall these different ways of creating cash-inflows will complement and support each other.\n\nI believe that bounties would create value for the steem ecosystem because it would attract new users that possess certain knowledge but do not have the ability to land the big hits via writing great blog posts. Additional users with need for information and questions would be attracted to the site.\n\n# The key competitors of steem use pay per view and transaction fees\nThe key competitors of steem use direct payments for content. In synereo one can pay for the attention of a specific user. In LBRY one can pay directly for a particular content. Similarly Yours plans to use micro transactions to pay for content and charge a fee for these transactions. The way steem pays for content is very new and unique and I think it will do very well vs. these cash flow strategies. Still I think it will be beneficial to have more than one monetization channel in order for steem to compete with these new social media blockchain ecosystems. Providing a way to pay for content more directly than via dilution will simply make steem more competitive and double its potential for growth.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmVYwtW1t4DTUfBh3r6iotRZdooFBRjeqDsqEPsKmP1ZqT'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmVYwtW1t4DTUfBh3r6iotRZdooFBRjeqDsqEPsKmP1ZqT'/></a>\nThe above is a diagram of how I would envision the cash in- and out-flows for the steem economy with bounties and promotions. \n\n\n# Functional requirements of a bounty system for steem\n\nI want to quickly outline how I envision bounties to work on steem\n\n### The bounty button\nSimilar to the promotion button, there should be a bounty button next to every post that allows anyone to put a bounty on a post. The bounty should be paid in SB only, just like the promotions. In addition to the ability to put bounties on one article there should be the ability to put a bounty on a hashtag. This dialog could be accessible via the menu bar. Potentially the promotion and bounty menu could also be integrated.\n\nWhen selecting a bounty, there should be a timeline that defines when the bounty is being paid. I think it would make sense to allow intervals up to the 30 days after the post was created, due to the functionality of steem. It might also make sense to have 3 time intervals such as 1 day, 1 week and 1 month.\n\nAll the bounty payments per pay period should be escrowed by the blockchain and the cumulative amount should be displayed on the post and the distribution of it on each post respectively in parallel how the reward money is visualized.\n\n### Paying out bounties\nThe bounty should be paid out to all the comments of a post according to how readers of the post have voted for it. If the bounty is for a hashtag than all level 1 post with that hashtag will receive the reward. The users that have paid for the bounty thereby should get a higher weight of their votes relative to how much of the bounty they have contributed, so that they define the majority of payout (i.e. 75%). Notice that flagging or negative votes are possible in the same way as for regular votes. \nExample: Assuming two users A and B with the same amount of SP and a bounty that has been placed by B for 1000 SD and user A voting for comment x and user B voting for comment y.  When the time for the payout arrives, the bounty should be distributed as 75% or 750SD to comment y and 250 SD or 25% to comment x and y such that comment y receives 875SD and comment x 125SD. If the SP of the users where different, than the 25% would be distributed according to SP weight in the same manner that steem distributes posting rewards.\nThis is to entice everyone to evaluate the solution to the bounty even if they have not paid for it and to ensure that a bounty can be paid even if some of the bounty posters do not vote for a solution.\n\nThe reward of the bounty of course should be in addition to the regular voting rewards steem pays out anyway.\n\nI don't think there is any reason to use part of the bounty as curation reward, since curation reward is already paid anyway and the bounty provider have intrinsic incentive to distribute the bounty fairly.\n\nI would also suggest to convert 50% of the payout into steem and distribute them via SP. This will decrease the SD supply and keep the steem ecology healthy.\n\n# Please provide feedback\n\nThis proposal for bounties has been thought out by myself and as such, I am sure it can be optimized and might have flaws. So please provide feedback. I will read and assess every comment and if needed make adjustment to this post. I hope @Dantheman @Dan and @Ned will find the time to read and comment on this as well.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI think bounties could propel the value of steem for its users and greatly improve the economics of steem. It seems to me that bounties would fit naturally into the reward and voting system of steem so that introducing them would come very intuitively to users. I can think of many use cases where I would use them and happily put significant value into the ecosystem to get a particular answer. The key value of bounties is that users can define how much certain information is worth to them and thus solve a key issue of the exchange of value via the internet.\n\nSteemit could leverage the functionality for marketing purposes, for instance to support a new language or a new topic and users we want to attract the site by putting bounties on hashtags.\n\nI hope this proposal is being read and optimized by many steem users and ultimately by the steemit team, so that it has a chance to be integrated into the blockchain.  I hope that on my next big trip or when I have specific technical question, I can just put up a bounty and have the internet generate the answer for me personally.\n\nThanks for reading, commenting and upvoting. Please follow me and check out my other post if you think this was valuable.",

    "body": "I know many people have been very concerned with the block on NSFW content from all categories, and have been concerned about the chance of the platform continuing to block other content.\n\nI think Steemit are doing a great job, and I understand some of their position if they end up censoring content. Being a US business means they will quickly run into legal issues with the content on their site, and may have to do some censorship. \n\nOf course thanks to the blockchain, it's never truly censored, and sites like UnderSteem can show it.\n\nThis is a follow up to my post from a few days ago, where [I launced the first TOR RPC and SEED node for STEEM.](https://steemit.com/steem/@someguy123/steem-tor-node-protecting-your-privacy).\n\n**As people should know by now, I'm strongly concerned about privacy and freedom.** In the past week:\n\n - I set up a TOR node for the STEEM network (link above)\n -  [raised almost $200 USD for RiseUP](https://steemit.com/steem/@someguy123/proof-of-riseup-donation)\n -  Set up a site for [fully anonymous steem accounts](https://steemit.com/steemit/@someguy123/anonsteem-create-anonymous-steem-accounts-without-social-media)\n\n----\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UPxM1Jf.png)\n\n\nWhat is UnderSteem?\n-----\n\nTL;DR\n\n - Uncensored - UnderSteem promises to have no censorship, including on pornography and piracy\n - Private - UnderSteem is only accessible over TOR. This means your IP address is never disclosed, so you're protected\n - Secure - Because UnderSteem is over TOR, the server locations are unknown. This makes it much harder to be hacked, because the attackers do not know the IP address of the servers, and they're only able to access the website\n - [Open Source](https://github.com/Someguy123/understeem/)\n\nUnderSteem is \"Underground Steem\". It is a fork of Steemit (not STEEM. It's on the same network), and is fully [open source, available here](https://github.com/Someguy123/understeem/). UnderSteem promises to avoid censorship on the client level, and operates it's servers within a safe jurisdiction, **since just like steemit, it does not store any content at all, and cannot be held responsible for any illegal activity.**\n\nTo allow the safest, most private experience, it's only available over TOR. I strongly recommend [downloading TOR Browser](https://torproject.org) - it's free, open source, and available on nearly every platform, **even Android and iOS**. (Don't worry, TOR is completely legal almost everywhere, including the US, practically every European country + the UK)\n\nOnce you have TOR browser, you can just enter the following URL into the address bar, and you'll be on UnderSteem:\n\n### <center>[usteempccoapgood.onion](http://usteempccoapgood.onion)</center>\n\nIf you just want to take a quick look *without TOR*, you can access the site through a gateway such as ONION.TO, however the site will not function fully through a gateway because of the JavaScript trying to communicate with [my TOR node](https://steemit.com/steem/@someguy123/steem-tor-node-protecting-your-privacy):\n### <center>Outside of TOR: [usteempccoapgood.onion.to](http://usteempccoapgood.onion.to)</center>\n\n\nWant to remember this URL? Just split the words up!\n\n<center>`usteem pc coap good`</center>\n\nDo I need to sign up?\n-----\n\n**You don't need to.** If you already have an account made on Steemit, or AnonSteem, you can log into the website with your username and password just like normal.\n\nIs it legal to access this site and use TOR?\n-----\n\nUnderSteem is not designed for illegal content any more than Steemit is, however the laws vary in every country. \n\nUnderSteem believes that the content should be free for the person to decide if they should view it or not, rather than their governments laws.\n\nWhile UnderSteem will avoid any form of censorship at all costs, **there's nothing illegal about using TOR** (in most countries), **or UnderSteem** unless you are purposely trying to access illegal content.\n\n----\n\n<center>Try it out!</center>\n\n### <center>[usteempccoapgood.onion](http://usteempccoapgood.onion)</center>\n\n### <center>Outside of TOR: [usteempccoapgood.onion.to](http://usteempccoapgood.onion.to)</center>\n\n----\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n**Why can't I see the upvote button?**\n\nYour security settings on TOR browser are too high. On the \"high\" setting, SVGs are blocked, which means the upvote button and other icons can't work. \n\nClick the TOR icon in the top left, and press \"Privacy and Security Settings\", and turn it down to at least Medium-High.\n\n**Why can't I log in?**\n\nYou probably need to enable javascript. Click the NoScript icon in the top left and whitelist the site.\n\n**Why are other categories/tags broken?**\n\nYou probably have Javascript disabled. Click the NoScript icon in the top left and whitelist the site.\n\nBe aware that the clearnet gateway (onion.to or onion.cab) isn't fully functional because of the javascript used on UnderSteem. To get a proper experience on UnderSteem, [download TOR](https://torproject.org)\n\n**I don't trust UnderSteem with my password, can I still use this service some other way?**\n\nYES. You can use your posting key as your password. Go to your Steemit account, click on \"Wallet\", then \"Permissions\". Click \"Show Private Key\" on your posting key, and paste that into the password box of UnderSteem. \n\nThis will only give the site the ability to make posts/comments, and upvote. It will not be able to access your wallet, or change your keys/password.\n\n**Is there an NSFW filter?**\n\nNO. We do not approve of any of the filtering. If you want filtered content (or are in a family/work setting), continue to use Steemit.\n\n\n---\n\nDo you like what I'm doing for STEEM/Steemit?\n----\n[Vote for me to be a witness](https://steemit.com/~witnesses) - every vote counts. \n----\nDon't forget to follow me for more like this.\n-------",

    "body": "<h1>Why I was such a tool and kept rage quitting and freaking out!</h1>\n\nWatch these two video's I posted a week or two ago:\n\n<center>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTsOvdSVWaI)</center>\n<center>&</center>\n<center>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qztAKXU83Fg)</center>\n\nThe short of the story is this:\n\nOn July 4th, only a few days after starting a new truck driving job, my mother passed away. On the 6th of July I picked up her ashes and she almost immediately started haunting me whenever I would try and sleep. For almost 7 weeks I went with only approximately 1 hour a night sleep because of her. Now I normally only sleep 2-3 hours a night so it took a while for the effects of this to really hit me. But about 5 weeks ago it did and I didn't even realize it. I had become an absolute monster.\n\nOnce I was able to get a load to the ocean (Miami, FL) and \"feed her to the fishies\" she left me alone and I have been back to my normal 2-3 hours a night sleep. I should note that I have a lot of injuries that prevent me from sleeping more than a few minutes at a time. Hence the reason I sleep so little.\n\nNow ordinarily I would say \"but that is no excuse\" and I would be right.....but the truth is seldom as black-and-white as that. In fact, in this case, it is an excuse and a damn good one IMHO. During that 7 weeks of averaging 1 hour a night sleep there were 10 nights with absolutely zero sleep. Guess what days I flipped out the worst....that's right on the nights I got no sleep at all. Between the pain I live with daily (which is 10 fold when I don't get sleep), the haunting by my mother, the lack of work (not driving or making any money) and the untold stress I was under because of all of the above I was quite literally \"not myself\".\n\nI will admit that I should have \"been aware of the way things were\" and avoided public interactions, however, the effects crept up slowly over roughly 4 weeks and went unnoticed. In fact I had no idea why I was acting the way I was until after I buried mom at sea. I knew something was wrong but thought Steemit had turned against me.....no idea in my head at the time that it was actually my fault, my behavior that had pushed Steemians away.\n\nBefore I could even realize what I was doing and that I was at fault I was banned from Steemit.Chat, multiple times on different accounts. For weeks I was unable to get on chat (for more than a few minutes before getting banned again) and if it weren't for my bestie (@steemitqa) I still wouldn't be on chat.\n\n<h1>The Apology!</h1>\n\nTo everyone I pissed off, offended, hurt, embarrassed or made think less of me <b>I AM TRULY SORRY!</b> I wasn't being myself and I assure you that it will never happen again. My stress level is still high and my wallet empty but I have learned from the past and my past mistakes and now recognize when I am becoming a tool and step away as I did earlier today when I was involved in a small disagreement with @noisy and it got under my skin. I didn't flip out, or rage quit. I just left Chat for an hour or two and went and did other things.\n\nI promise that you will never see any more Public Tantrums, Rage Quits or other asinine behavior from me. \n\n<h1>How not to act on Steemit & Steemit.Chat!</h1>\n\nFirst let me say that \"Free-Speech is a double-edged sword\" which is a lesson I learned the hard way. Yes you are free to say whatever you want on Steemit and Steemit.Chat, but just like IRL there are consequences to your actions. This is a quick guide, Steemit Etiquette if you will:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Treat Others the Way You Want to be Treated - I know this is an old adage but it is the most important thing I can impart to anyone and it doesn't just apply to Steemit/Chat!</li>\n<li>Telling the whale that has repeatedly upvoted your content and made you tons of SP to \"go f*&k yourself\" repeatedly in a public chat room is also REALLY REALLY not a good idea. Even after he \"forgave\" me and told the mods to let me back on Chat I fear I will never regain his trust or his upvotes. Thankfully he wasn't a vengeful person and didn't flag everything I ever posted. Not going to call him by name as he asked to be \"left alone\" and I respect that.....but if you read this I REALLY AM SORRY MAN!</li>\n<li>Remember when posting or commenting on Steemit.com or in Steemit.Chat that you aren't the only one who is going to read what you write. There are people of all ages, genders, ethnicities, educational levels, languages and income levels (both on Steemit and IRL) that will see your post/comment.....so be mindful of what you say and more specifically HOW IT WILL BE INTERPRETED!</li>\n<li>Just because your post/comment doesn't make tons of money doesn't mean it wasn't Quality Content. It just means that no one saw it. (Unless you do like me and piss everyone off then it doesn't matter how good your writing is it still won't make any money!)</li>\n<li>Spamming your posts (links) to people on Steemit.Chat will turn them against you so when you do make a mistake they will be even more likely to complain and have you banned or worse flag your posts.</li>\n<li>The secret to becoming successful on Steemit is simple, really: Spend time getting to know people in Chat, voting and commenting (Curating) other's posts and when you do Promote your content do it in the proper rooms. Also make sure you encourage people who do find your posts to \"follow me\" with a link to your Blog (https://steemit.com/@venupscs).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Summary!</h1>\n\nIf you let stuff bother you, get under your skin and don't step away from the situation you will wind up in my shoes, ignored by Steemians and destined to never again make any money or get any help from them, even when you need it the most.\n\n<h2>SO DON'T BE LIKE ME, BE BETTER!</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\nOh and make sure you <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@venuspcs\">Follow Me</a>!",

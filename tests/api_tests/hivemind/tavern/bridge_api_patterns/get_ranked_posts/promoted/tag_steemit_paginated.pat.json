    "body": "Trading Steem is not hard. In that part steem(it) development team has done a great job. Compared to the establishment Steem is a huge step in the right direction of fairness and openness.\n# How the JS index works\nJS measures the net result of the buyers and sellers actions.\nEveryone buying Steem (or anything else) in any financial instruments market does it to profit. Interesting distinction is however if those buyers or seller do expect their profits short term or long term.\n\n## How short term Steem \u201cspeculators\u201d act?\nThey buy steem and expect return in a matter of days, weeks, months.\n## How long term Steem \u201cinvestors\u201d act?\nThey buy steem and expect return in a matter of years. They buy steem, and in this particular high devaluation environment that Steem is quickly power up .\n\nMeasuring the net result from the Steem \u201cspeculators\u201d and  Steem \u201cinvestors\u201d buying, compared to Steem owners selling can give us the ultimate tool to measure the future price movement of Steem (in  the short to medium term).\n\n# And it turns out to be incredible easy\nAll of the described above is nothing more than the \u2026 increase/decrease of the total Steem held by exchanges! (with a few caveats I will keep  proprietary for now)\n\n# How this matters\u2026 give me a practice example.\nOK here it is.\nSteem hit a local low of 0.001224 btc/steem on 08/29 4:30 UTC. Since then the price is generally higher. Should you buy (out of FOMO) or wait for the price to come down to even lower levels sometime in the near future.\nIf JS index has fallen down since  08/29 (as it has indeed) this means that all the buying (price increase) was by short time speculators. So, if no news justifie their buying exuberance, you can expect soon those speculative buyers to give up/cash out of their short term position and the price to continue following the long term trend of the JS index itself.\n\n# Initial JS index\nThe index is set at __1000.000__ as for 2016-07-26 12:56:12 UTC\n\n# Current  JS index\nAs of 2016-08-31 03:03 (UTC) the value is: __553.650__\n#\n[EDIT]\nBelow is a chart of JS Index and Steem price for July 27th to Aug 30th NB some days have more than one data point.\n#\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Ukazg7G.png)\n#\n#steemit #trading #finance #steem #money",

If you'd like to participate in the beta, simply send an email to steemapp@gmail.com and which device (iOS or Android) so we can send you a beta invite.  We're utilizing hockeyapp.net (microsoft) to manage the beta. \n\n### Some important things about the beta:\n- *Use at your own risk - **period**.*  \n- Don't login with an account that has your life savings in STEEM. Why? Because this is a beta product!\n- Don't login with your password if you don't feel comfortable - you can still use the app without logging in. Key import options will be available in a future version.\n- Images you upload from your mobile device are publicly available to the world. \n- Image hosting providers could change during the beta and your images could be wiped out permanently without notice\n- We receive crash reports, analytics and other useful debugging information from HockeyApp\n- Once signed up, you will receive notifications to download all future versions of the beta\n- Are there known issues? Yup! Expect frequent beta versions with no announcement.\n- Hockey provides features to send us feedback directly. There's a 100% chance we'll get your feedback if you submit through hockey app or email us steemapp@gmail.com.\n\n# How You Can Help\nWe are developing at a feverishly-fast pace...as fast as two guys can who have day jobs and families to support.  If we could, we'd say adios to the day job and focus 100% on Steemy (that's a dream I have weekly).   That being said, the reality is that we are building this with our own time, energy and spare funds.   That makes us no less passionate or driven, but imposes real-world constraints on development.\n\nYou can help us by:\n1) Participating in the beta\n2) Giving us constructive feedback on crashes, design, and other app-specifics\n3) Of course, financial - any funds we receive via upvoting go directly to supporting our monthly server costs, red bull addiction, etc...\n\n# How to sign up for the beta\n- Email us at steemapp@gmail.com and tell us which device (iOS or Android) you want an invite for\n- Or, if you don't care who sees your email address, post a comment below and specify iOS or Android (or both)\n\n# What is Steemy?\n\n[Learn more about Steemy Here](https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemapp/introducing-steemy-fully-native-ios-android-apps-for-steem)",

    "body": "![jumpingpeoplesteemitanarchyfaba6.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/jumpingpeoplesteemitanarchyfaba6.jpg)\n\nFor many of us, Steemit has already changed so much - the way we navigate the web, the way we think about money, and for a fortunate committed few, it's even changed their professions. However, the change that I expect from this model goes even deeper. It's possible that Steemit, and descendent technologies, may play a part in creating a voluntary world, a stateless world, in which everyone who takes money from someone, or puts someone in a cage without their consent, or orders such acts, will be seen and treated as a criminal. There are several ways in which Steemit can aid this cause. Let's start with the most important - the conversation.\n\n# It changes the way we talk\n![argument288ba5.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/argument288ba5.jpg)\n## The problem with voluntaryist argumentation\nMany of you might have noticed, and even been a party to, hard-line conversations about anarchy, in which the voluntaryist proceeds to take the words of the other party, and question them about some perceived inconsistency in their beliefs, attempting to lead them through a Socratic dialogue, in order to bring them to accept the truth - that the other party is wrong - very, very wrong. You also might have noticed (as I eventually noticed, after years of banging my head on walls) that this technique almost never works.\n\nOf course, the reason that it doesn't work, is because people have a need to feel that they're being understood, that their concerns are heard, that their thoughts are valid. In brief, they need to feel like people. If you don't treat someone like a person - unless you're talking to an exceptionally patient person - you're unlikely to receive a personable response.\n## An oasis\nThe comment section on YouTube is a running joke. Facebook discussions descend into dirtslinging, strawmen and threats. You may wade through many racist and sexist comments before you find something that is truly valuable information, and even then it may be tainted with aggression. In contrast, Steemit's comments sections seem like a desert oasis - all but filled with calm discussion, respect, insight, or at the very least, positivity. Surely, this is a place where one can have a constructive conversation about controversial topics.\n## The incentive to be good\nI have noticed over these few short months, the way that Steemit has changed the way that I interact with people, especially online - on Steemit and other social networks. I've found myself a few times, even as I'm about to make a statement which is mildly passive-aggressive, thinking \"Hold on - is this something I would write if my reputation were on the line? If not, maybe I shouldn't write it.\" Even when I'm going to give someone some piercing criticism, which, if presented in the wrong way, may seem a condemnation, I can find ways to demonstrate empathy, such as compliments or other niceties.\n\nIt may sound like an unfortunate description of humanity (or of myself) to say it, but when our bank balances and reputations are on the line in every moment, we can find ways to communicate more kindly, and therefore, more fluidly, with the people we interact with.\n## Commitment and consistency\nIn Cialdini's famous and excellent book, [Influence: The psychology of persuasion](http://amzn.to/2c5z38T) he describes how, when people make a commitment to something, they are more likely to see it as part of their identity, and strive to live up to that identity.\n\nWhen people are kind to each other, respectful, and even open-minded on Steemit, it's not just that they're pretending to be nice. By acting nicer, they become nicer. By acting more open-minded, they become more open-minded.\n## The quality of our ideas\nIf the ideas of voluntaryism are as good as we believe they are, then surely a place like Steemit, where people are strongly encouraged to be respectful, considerate, empathetic and even open-minded, would be an ideal place to discuss them. If it turns out that our ideas are not as good as we think they are, then it gives us the perfect medium to discover something even better. That is beautiful.\n# Tax-free and shameless\n![breakchains10ab9.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/breakchains10ab9.png)\nIn many developed countries, taxes are generally seen as legitimate and necessary, and people claim to be proud of paying their taxes - sometimes because they truly believe it, and sometimes because they don't want to face the fact that they have been forced into an elaborate con, from which they have no apparent escape.\u007f\n\nBut what if they did have an escape? What if, instead of being paid as an employee, having their income taxes automatically deducted from their pay, they were paid directly. What if thousands or millions of people were making income, or making a living, this way, and decided to openly flout the tax authority, publicly, knowing that it wouldn't have the resources to pursue any more than a small fraction of the cases?\n\nObviously, that would damage the appearance of legitimacy of the state, and also the perception of omniscience and omnipotence that its proponents tend to ascribe to it.\n# Development of cryptoanarchic solutions\n>\"Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word 'anarchy', in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It\u2019s a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.\"\n> - Wei Dai\n\nWe all know that Steemit/Steem is much more accessible than virtually any other cryptocurrency, being based around a style of platform which more than one billion people are already familiar with. That's pretty cool, and that means that more money will flow into cryptocurrency, meaning more attention, and thus even more development for similar technologies.\n\nMore development in cryptocurrency means more methods to control money, and other forms of information, publicly, privately, or anonymously, without governments being able to do anything about it.\n# Conclusion\nSteemit is an important step, a continuation of the snowball effect of cryptocurrency, leading us to a voluntary, cryptoanarchic future, full of wonders we have not yet imagined, and degrees of freedom as yet unforeseeable. Boldly we take our pens, pads, keyboards and wallets, building a highway to a world where concepts are our language and our tools, but never our weapons, where the purity of ideas is worth fighting for, but never worth fighting with.\n\n---\n\n# About me\n\n[![kurt robinson in the mountains of puebla](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/26/pictureofmecroppedbdb8d.md.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/gsqzK)\n\nMy name is Kurt Robinson.

Professional knowledge, in particular technical know-how, is a key asset for such organizations as their success depends to a large extent on their ability to create, manage and transfer knowledge efficiently. Let us call this process <strong>knowledge valorisation.</strong> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I review below some of the key enablers of knowledge valorisation&nbsp;by sketching a sort of road map.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Step 1</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;The first step shown below&nbsp;might look trivial, but I believe that most organizations (in particular those which are in the process of restructuring, M&amp;A, etc)&nbsp;might find it worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/ueoc9n77j/road.png\" width=\"959\" height=\"545\"/></p>\n<p>In other words,&nbsp;the first challenge is to make sure that knowledge is properly tracked and stored, especially if the organization is very large.&nbsp; If knowledge turns out to be mostly in <strong>implicit</strong> form, the organization runs a significant risk to lose knowledge and performance as a result of staff turnover, as when the key people leave or retire, nobody may be able to run some critical processes. In addition, as implicit knowledge is difficult to share, if explicit knowledge on key processes is not available, it is difficult for new recruits to become quickly operational. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>If a large body of documents spanning the organizational knowledge landscape is available in electronic format, it is appropriate to set up and use a formal knowledge classification scheme. The most powerful approach to knowledge classification, following the principles of semantics, is based on two components: &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Taxonomies</strong>, i.e. multi-level, tree-like classification frameworks. An example of a comprehensive, well-known taxonomy is Linnaeus\u2019 classification scheme for nature as divided into three kingdoms: mineral, vegetable and animal. Linnaeus used five levels: class, order, genus, species, and variety.&nbsp;Advanced knowledge management might call for the definition of multiple taxonomies, as shown in the example below. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Classification rules</strong>, i.e. a set of criteria to place each document in one (or more) positions in the taxonomy. Rules are typically based on specific properties of the document. Simple classification rules are based on keywords and other metadata, e.g. if a document has \u201cJava\u201d as a keyword, it is likely to be classified under a \u201ccomputer science\u201d branch of a technological taxonomy. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above elements, taken as a whole constitute an <strong>ontology</strong>, i.e. a detailed, potentially exhaustive description of a knowledge domain in terms of a collection of data records, together with their metadata/attributes, organized and classified in one or more taxonomy-based \u201ccatalogues\u201d. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/jbvf5lv93/semantics.png\" width=\"1006\" height=\"522\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The pictures above refer to&nbsp;an ontology which is relevant to a public research organization which regards technology transfer as part of its mission.&nbsp;Such organizations feel strong pressure by their funding bodies to demonstrate the positive socio-economic impact of public research on society through concrete examples. In order to meet such demands, they must define and implement a proactive and cost-effective Knowledge &amp; Technology Transfer (KTT) strategy. Then it is essential that all the knowledge assets in the organization are identified (technologies, general know-how, training capabilities) and as many KTT channels (licensing of intellectual property, joint R&amp;D with industry, training, people mobility \u2026) as possible are enabled. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>At this point, a classification engine is used:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/fk988pp6j/classify.png\" width=\"971\" height=\"558\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The ultimate deliverable is a context-sensitive, searchable knowledge catalogue&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/w8zb4dy35/catalogue.png\" width=\"1065\" height=\"616\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Informal Summary</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>All the tools described above aim at avoiding that in a large organization people reinvent the wheel all the time, just out of lack of knowledge of what their colleagues are working/have worked on. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, using the wheel analogy: if you are into technology transfer, such tools will help&nbsp;you show your \"wheel\" outside your organization and identify whoever could use it to make an innovative car!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note that some older comments to this post refer to (very different) content which has now been removed. Please disregard them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "Revamping Curation Is The Way To Increase Steem Power Demand\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been living under a rock, for the past month or so, it has been quite clear that the price of Steem has been rapidly falling. Although before the run up to $4 was most likely in a bubble and the system is in no danger of failing, as it has worked at this price before, I still believe there is a long term solution that needs to be found to fix this problem. Ned made a post yesterday talking about ideas he had, which mostly, in my opinion focused on lowering the supply entering the market, but this is only a symptom of the problem. My solution although a bit drastic addresses the problem which is a lack of incentive to purchase Steem and power up. \n\nhttp://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/sites/chicagoartistsresource.org/files/curator_1.jpg\n\nTo begin, what are the incentives now? Well the main incentive is having weight while voting, as well as getting a daily return on the Steem Power you have in the system. These might seem like adequate incentives in theory, but in practice I think we are seeing something very different. The problem right now is even with the daily interest we are getting on our Steem Power, we have still been losing money due to the price drops. The interest, which is supposed to act like inflation protection, is actually doing nothing because as long as the price is falling, people are not going to want to move their Steem dollars or Steem into Steem Power. We need to give a greater incentive to hold and purchase Steem Power that will benefit us as a community in the long run. Sure we can wait for the price to fall and have people cash out and make it cheaper to enter the system, but this still doesn\u2019t address the underlying problem.\n\nSo what is my solution? I strongly believe we need to move the payout split to 50:50 between authors and curators from the current 75:25 it is at. I know this will be controversial, especially because many authors today, INCLUDING MYSELF, are making essentially a living off the site, but ultimately it comes down to what is best for the community. We need to look at who is adding more value to the site, the authors or the curators. Depending on who you ask their answer might be different, but in my opinion both are equally as important. One cannot survive without the other and the payouts should reflect that.\n\nhttps://steemit.com/images/steemit-share.png\n\nCurating is supposed to be a heavy incentive for people to enter the system, but the earnings from it are subpar at best. For example, I have 20,000 Steem Power and my average earnings per day is around 6 Steem Power. That means my daily return on investment is .03% a day and only around 11% a year and that is with a pretty profitable curating strategy. Sure it will technically come out to a bit higher than 11% due to compounding but it still won\u2019t make that much of a difference. A huge selling point to me was that if you choose to curate rather than create content you will also be able to earn a sufficient amount, but no one is going to put 20,000 Steem into Steem Power that they would have to wait 2 years to pull out if the reward of waiting is not sufficient enough. Selling Steemit as a platform where the users who upvote the content are equally as valuable as the users who create the content makes users actually want to buy Steem and convert it into Steem Power. \n\nWe should not focus on slowing down the supply that enters the market, but rather retaining and creating new users that will become active daily. Once people have upvotes that actually mean something we will see people flock to the system. Rather than just browsing reddit and upvoting, with no return, they would have a much better experience here. The majority of the people on the site are not authors but lurkers or readers and we need to cater specifically to that crowd because they will end up as the masses, should more come. Authors deserve to be paid for their work but the percentage of money that goes to payouts is a lot. \n\n\nhttp://www.firebellymarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/building-community-Firebelly-570x467.jpg\n\nLike I stated before, I have been very successful and Steemit which is why I want to cut down my rewards, because if we continue in the direction we are currently going, it will become a race to the bottom , at which point everyone will leave. I strongly believe that splitting the curation rewards and author rewards equally can benefit the demand for Steem power in the long run and cause a higher amount of user retention within the system. \n\n-Calaber24p",

    "body": "<center>https://i.imgflip.com/p1ij6.jpg<br/>**CENSORSHIP**</center>\n\nLanguage is a very powerful tool because it shapes the way we think. The words we choose to use [impact how we think, feel, and reason about the world around us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity). Today I would like to address the word *censorship* because it is a very hot topic on steemit.\n\nThe first problem we always face is different and ambiguous definitions for censorship.  Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t always practical to *define* our terms in every debate and therefore drama queens toss the term \u201ccensorship\u201d around far too easily. I would go so far as to say that the censorship card is played about as often and illegitimately as the race card.  Often those who play the *race card* are more *racist and oppressive* than those they slander, the same principle applies to those who play the censorship card.\n\n## Censorship requires Aggression \n\nThe defining characteristic of a free society is the absence of initiation of violence. This includes the credible threat of violence, fraud, theft, etc.   Without the threat of aggression people can freely say whatever they want, whenever they want without fear that their person or property will be harmed. A critical distinction of a free society is that you cannot express yourself in ways that violate the property rights of others.\n\n## Graffiti is Aggression and violation of Property Rights\n \nGraffiti is defined as writing or drawings scribbled, scratched, or **sprayed illicitly on a wall or other surface in a public place**. In a free society the Graffiti artist would be tracked down and expected to pay restitution to the property owner.  No rational individual would argue that the artist has been censored by the property owner or that the property owner is the one initiating aggression against the artist.\n\n## Property Owner defines Art vs Graffiti \nThere are places where graffiti-style art is acceptable and is actually encouraged. In this case no aggression has occurred and therefore the action is legitimate. \n\n<center> https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7485/15754046208_7d666a75a9_o.jpg</center>\n\n## Spam, Porn, Harassment, and Fraudulent posts are Digital Graffiti  \n\nWhen it comes to websites like Facebook, YouTube, Google, Reddit, and Steemit we have digital property owned by individuals providing a free and voluntary service to society. It is not possible for these organizations to censor user content because they are not using violence, theft, etc. \n\nThe only true censorship is when government agents approach these companies and demand content be removed under threat of force or violence.  Provided these companies are not under any kind of threat, there can be no censorship.\n\nWhen someone [demands that YouTube share ad revenue](/steemit/@calaber24p/censorship-on-youtube-creates-an-unique-opportunity-for-decentralized-platforms-like-steemit-to-create-an-alternative-video) they are taking the role of the Graffiti artist that demands property owners not repaint over their artwork.\n\nSome people may consider the [Graffiti artwork worth thousands of dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy), but this doesn\u2019t change the moral character of the vandalism.  Likewise, some people may feel their humor, sarcasm, teasing, crude language, or vulgar posts to be artwork and demand that other users see it and/or up vote it for payment. \n\n## Graffiti Hurts Community Value \n\nWe all love the idea that Free Speech adds value to the speaker, but our selfish desires to be heard come at the expense of the listeners.  Few people desire to move into a neighborhood where there is unfettered graffiti and complete disrespect for property rights.  Likewise, few people want to join an online community where there are no standards of mutual respect.\n\n## A Perception Problem \n\nWe have a very real problem in society today.  The problem is that people feel *entitled* to things that are not theirs.  Whether it is health care, google ranking, reputation, or [right for gay couples to be served by particular vendors who oppose gay marriage](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jul/08/tony-perkins/wedding-vendors-have-been-forced-participate-same-/).  These entitlements can only be delivered by initiating force and violence against innocent people.\n\nIf a particular vendor (YouTube, Facebook, Google, or your Local Florist) will not serve you, then you must take your business elsewhere.  Vendors who lose a significant amount of business will voluntarily reconsider their policies.   \n\n## But they have a monopoly!  \n\nTo the extent that a business gains the vast majority of the market share without relying on government regulations to shield them from competition, the monopoly is deserved and was earned by providing a quality product that others were unable to compete with.\n\nThere are no laws forcing everyone to use Google, YouTube, Reddit, or Facebook. There are no regulations preventing competitors from starting up and competing.  Complaining about their unwillingness to serve you is like a local mall refusing to allow certain tenants.  It will certainly make business more challenging for those tenants, but the prospective tenants are not entitled to a prime high-traffic spot in the mall.\n\n## Flagging Posts based upon Differing Opinions \n\nSome people have been complaining about users who down-vote posts they disagree with. The basis of the idea is that all posts are *entitled to* funding from those who support the ideas.  This stance is in direct opposition to the vested interests of every stakeholder.  \n\n\n<center>http://godfatherpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/thomas-jefferson.png</center>  \n\nWhat should happen when one stakeholder wishes to fund a cause abhorrent to another stakeholder of equal size?  The two opinions are canceled out and the remaining stakeholders get to decide.\n\n## Incentive to be Tolerant and Inclusive \n\nAll users, particularly whales, have financial incentive to be tolerant and inclusive.  This grows the overall network effect and makes everyone the most money possible.  To the extent any community adopts a culture of intolerance that overly restricts the range of acceptable opinion it will push people away.  New communities will form to serve the needs of those who are rejected and the free market competition for mindshare will continue.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf Steem remains a libertarian / anarchist enclave then it will fail to attract a broader audience and that in turn will mean that ordinary people will not get involved with cryptocurrency.  Likewise, if Steemit fails to curtail abusive, threatening, and toxic individuals it will also drive away the broader audience leaving only those with skin thick enough to take the abuse of trolls.  \n\nI want Steem be a healthy, vibrant community with engaging discussions from people with all points of view. Unfortunately (and fortunately?), I am only one of many users who have a say in what kind of content gets voted on.  Each and every one of us contributes to the culture and we will all succeed or fail based upon how we act.\n\nLets stop throwing the term \u201ccensorship\u201d around here on Steemit unless it is explicitly referring to the threat of violence.  It is out of place and conjures up inappropriate negative reactions similar to playing the race card.  Instead, lets focus on the rights of all voters to express their opinion for or against any post.  If you disagree with how someone is voting, then focus your argument on how something adds or removes value to the community rather than whether someone is committing the \u201cvile\u201d sin of non-censorship by utilizing their legitimate voting rights.\n\nSteemit is a free and voluntary platform built on the basis of free association; censorship is impossible in such an environment even if the community or steemit.com chooses to minimize the visibility of some content or block it all together.  \n\nThe blockchain is open, your content is logged and recorded for all time.  Anyone who wants to see your content or offer a competing service to steemit.com is free to curate and display what they like.  \n\n## P.S. On Definitions \n\nWe live in a world where common words are generally used in ways that are in direct contradiction of their meaning.  The unfortunate reality dramatically lowers the quality of public discourse because it allows people to talk past each other.  Activists leverage the emotional response to the word censorship to provoke people into violating the property rights of others.  It may well be that censorship is taking on a broader meaning that would also encompass the no coerced behavior of Google, Facebook, etc.   The problem with the broader meaning is that the word censorship is no longer useful for accurately defining moral/immoral behavior.  Under the broader definition, accusing someone of censorship is as meaningless as accusing them of filtering spam emails.  How dare they censor spam artists!",

It\u2019s a fascinating thing really. This is one of the biggest mind-boggling mysteries that seem to defy even time itself, mysteries that are impossible to explain from a purely rational point of view.\n\nAsk any person in the world \u2013 scratch that \u2013 ask any person in the history of the world to describe politics in one word and you are guaranteed to hear some of the following words: Deceiving, dishonest, incompetent, cheating\u2026Etc. And probably, this is from the generous side.\n\nNow,  ask any of those people how come they trusted those individuals to manage their finances, and it would seem like you\u2019re speaking Chinese to them.\n\n## And that area right there is where the real game is being played.\n\nThat\u2019s the space where critical thinking dulls, where the emperor sells clothes, and no one\u2019s looking at Pinocchio\u2019s nose. How on earth would a known dishonest, power hungry person convince the others that he should be the one that makes the decisions on behalf of everybody?\n\nWorse than that, they give them all the power, no accountability and a virtual 100% probability to screw them , and everybody just keeps pretending to be surprised when these things happens.\n\n# Why Does This Keep Happening to Me?\n\nYou change the country, you change the century but the song remains the same, and the mystery survives. The only way to keep convincing people to accept a deal that acts against their own self-interest is to create a story that makes the exploitation of mankind look like the solution to their problem. \n\n![Alt text](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/lostpedia/images/b/b2/Lastsupper.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100117063640)\n\nYou look around, you find countries like Bolivia or Venezuela (just to give a few examples) that are extraordinarily blessed at the very same time with a rich abundance in natural resources  and a starving population despite the fact that these two things should be mutually exclusive by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nYou can\u2019t be that incompetent if you tried.\n\nBut then again, this isn\u2019t about incompetence. Their solutions were already predetermined in the narrative, and when it doesn't work and the tale falls on its own weight, they\u2019ll just repeat the same process again, because the narrative remains the same.\n\nThey keep seizing more lands, more factories and they keep \u201ccracking down\u201d on competition and seize everything in the name of \u2018the common good\u2019. Then they bankrupt them as well and they seize more and bankrupt those too. \n\n### If it wasn\u2019t so heartbreaking it would be hilarious.\n\nHere\u2019s the crazy part of all this is that  this wide spread phenomenon is completely irrelevant to the economic system, the economic policy, or to the continent, and it's happening across the board. \n\n![Alt Text](http://redlikeme.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bank-robbery-digital-art-hd-wallpaper-1920x1080-2127.jpg)\n\nFind me a person in southern Europe that has good things to say about politicians in the ECB.\n\nAll the solutions they present are hell bent on screwing the little guy, whether it\u2019s draconian austerity measures, raising the retirement age, bank bail outs\u2026Etc\n\nI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s due to incompetence, dishonesty, or both. I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s irrelevant, because the solution is already pre-set beforehand to achieve one purpose, and one purpose only, that power keeps consolidating itself. \n\nThat might explain why we always keep hearing sentences like this one: *\u201cThe game is rigged\u201d*, which happens to be one of the most popular expressions of our generation.\n\nLet me give you another example.\n\nWhen you turn on the radio and there are some finance experts on, how many times we hear the following words: \n\n*They\u2019re making things worse; They\u2019re repeating the same mistakes again;  Things are actually getting worse and not better; The solutions are creating more problems than solving; How come the recovery is worse than the recession?*\n\nYou see where this is going? \n\nAnd this is not exclusive to our generation, in fact this story form is a very common archetypal myth that exists across every society and period of human history.  With the very same the result, that whatever action that will be taken it will only serve to reinforce the dominant narrative.\n\n# Once Upon a Time\n\nIt is believed that the cavemen were the first storytellers, and whoever controlled the dominant story had a strong pull on the rest of society.\n\n![Alt Text](http://www.kino.de/wp-content/gallery/homo-erectus-2007/homo-erectus-einfach-pr-hysterisch-11-rcm0x1920u.jpg)\n\nThe  human story is at the heart of everything, it\u2019s the prima material of how most people perceive reality, the moment you question someone else\u2019s dominant narrative, the debate is over before it\u2019s even started. For many people, they much rather fall for the same thing again and again and until the end of times, rather than to dare questioning the story they grew up around.\n\n> ### *\u201cIt\u2019s easier to fool people, than show them that they have been fooled\u201d.*\u2014 Mark Twain\n\nThe crazy part however, is that the even if those individuals were to fully realized how they've been fooled, they would probably still willingly walk towards the fire nonetheless. Metaphorically speaking.\n\n### Unless of course, there is a new story that replaces the old story.\n\nI remember reading one of James Altucher\u2019s amazing posts and had a wake up call. I hope I\u2019m not butchering the story, but it basically it goes like this: A friend of James asked him to go with her to the bank to help her decide the best option for her to put her money. Since he has some solid expertise in the finance world, it seemed like a wise decision for her part.\n\nDuring that meeting in the bank, James just sat down, said nothing and only listened, when they finally left the bank he started explaining to her all the ways that they were trying to take advantage of her and rip her off.\n\n*\u201cHow can they do that to me?\u201d*\n\nThe next day, she went to the bank and did everything they asked her nonetheless.\n\n![Alt text](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/maggiemcgrath/files/2015/06/0211_hipster-piggy-bank-401k_1024x576.jpg)\n\n# This is How the Story Goes\n\nCommon folklore has it that there are those people among us that regular people  that look just like me and you, but when they get a magical paper that says that they work for the status quo, then an invisible laser descends from the sky and grants them all sorts supernatural abilities and financial savoir-faire.\n\nWell, sort of... Everything they touch still goes to crap, but that doesn\u2019t matter anymore and their never-ceasing incompetence doesn\u2019t seem to bother anyone either. Because now, they're part of the narrative.\n\n### And apparently, narrative trumps logic. \n\nA successful investor once told me: *Never listen to government economists, if they knew how to manage money, they would\u2019ve made money themselves instead of telling people what to do.*\n\n![Alt Text](https://ascendingstarseed.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/cc12b-preppers2b-2bdoomsday.jpg)\n\nAs the Altucher story goes, along with countless others, whenever there is a threat to the narrative, the debate is over before it has even started. For many people in the world, defying authority is just about the last thing they would do, and that includes killing themselves and their own children.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to the subject of the day. We tell ourselves a story that defies every single law of the universe, that the idea of good business is spending trillions of Dollars bombing millions of people and generating the biggest debtor nation the world has ever seen.\n\nIf that is not telling you anything then honestly, I don\u2019t know what does.\n\nWe tell ourselves even crazier stories, that if we just grabbed enough productive citizens and stacked them into jail cells for victim-less crimes, or for carrying bits of vegetation in their pockets, then we're going to revitalize the economy, and that oh! We will rehabilitate those poor souls through brutality and sexual violence.\n\n### Again, narrative trumps logic in ways logic can't even perceive.\n\nSome people choose to deny their programming, and that seems as the right choice because sooner or later those stories could start acting as their very own gatekeepers. I\u2019m not talking about inner resistance, I\u2019m saying that maybe we need a new story that replaces the old story.\n\n![Alt Text](http://i0.wp.com/dailyzen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/How-to-Make-Good-choices-and-make-the-most-of-them.jpg)\n\nThere has never been a better time for financial independence than the times we live in, there has never been so many options available for someone to start their own company, find jobs, or make their own movies even\u2026 All of that without dealing with a large number of resistant gate-keepers who may or may not have been programmed to serve a certain narrative.\n\nI don't know about you but personally, if I had to follow a narrative, I much rather have one that I designed for myself rather than one that I was born into.\n\n# Closing thoughts\n\nThey say that when there is a paradigm shift, there is usually a new story that renders the other story irrelevant, but until then and even though the tools are already available to the public, people will not make the final move until they start seeing a certain degree of mass-adoption around them.\n\nIt is that mass adoption aspect that would make it acceptable for their psyche to separate from that old, probably coercive narrative that has been attached to them.\n\n![Alt Text](http://www.elfm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/storytelling-night.jpg)\n\nA few minutes ago, I was just going to end this piece with a question: \u201cDoes the Blockchain need a story?\u201d\n\nBut then I realized that steemit has both the crypto-currency and the story aspect. So I\u2019m swapping that question for a few modest words:\n\nCan we just work together to build something beautiful? Do you guys see what we have here? Why don\u2019t we just focus on what we have and how we can improve it. After all, it\u2019s much harder to create something really great when you\u2019re being held back by unnecessary drama. Wouldn't you agree?\n\n And not to forget:\n\n### Your dream needs you full steem.\n \nSources: [1](http://www.geliosoft.com/100-happy-dollars-3d/) - [2](http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lost_Supper) - [3](http://redlikeme.ca/tpp-is-all-about-banking-powers-which-will-remain-secret-for-5-years-after-signing/) - [4](http://www.kino.de/film/homo-erectus-2007/) - [5](http://money.cnn.com/pf/millennials-and-their-money/) - [6](https://ascendingstarseed.wordpress.com/category/economy-and-global-collapse/) - [7](http://dailyzen.co.uk/2015/03/19/how-to-make-good-choices-and-make-the-most-of-them/) - [8](https://storify.com/ProfKarim/the-power-of-storytelling)\n\n## [*Follow the Alien*](https://steemit.com/@the-alien)",

They're not fully mature and could use a good rinsing by the community.\n\n## Allow Steem holders to delegate their Steem Power voting rights to a **voting pool**\n\nA delegated voting pool could socialize voting power and individualize rewards.  One prime use for this could be the @steemit account.  @steemit could create a voting pool and invite anyone with a verified identity and good reputation to join the pool as a curator.  This could increase the number of unique curators, help bootstrap Steem as an identity database and give people even more incentives to sign up.\n\nTo show the numbers, an example would be Alice Bob and Charley each delegate their SP of 2, 3, and 7 to one voting pool.  Now they each have 4, 4, and 4 SP to be used to curate.  Better curation would earn them more curation rewards.  \n\nA side effect of delegated voting pools could be voting markets.  Any user would have the power to create a voting pool and these users could charge curators for participation. Some of the platform's whales could be interested in offering subscription models to minnows as a way to get more voting influence.\n\n## If powering down stake loses voting influence\n\nImagine that any stake being powered down would lose its rights to use voting influence.  This could make the system very clear in the regard that stake is either in or it is out.  Users could be able to choose any % of their stake to power down regardless of how many accounts they have and only the % stake that is powering down would lose voting influence.  Stopping a power down could return all voting rights.\n\nPerhaps the effect of this could be 1/ more interest to stay in the platform and 2/ more fluidity in the witness queue 3/ more fairness regarding the PoS nature of Steem 4/ more clarity from participants looking to exit the system\n\n## Combined effect?\nPerhaps these proposals could have a combined effect that increases the demand and fluidity of Steem Power while improving the curated experience for people visiting Steem based websites.\n\n#### What are your thoughts and questions?",

Right now, if you are not upvoted by a \"whale\" account, it is very difficult to get exposure and any substantial rewards, which leads to many great authors leaving Steemit. Robin Hood wants to be the \"whale\" that finds and helps a diverse set of talented, yet unrecognized authors. \r\nMore Info Here -> <a href=https://steemit.com/steem/@repholder/the-robinhood-whale-initiave-community-feedback-needed>The RobinHood Whale Initiave</a>   |  [Announcing RobinHoodWhale](https://steemit.com/robinhoodwhale/@robinhoodwhale/announcing-robinhoodwhale-the-steemit-deep-sea-savior)\n<h3> Voting History (Real-Time Update) </h3> \n<li>01-09 <a href=https://steemit.com/introduction/@leahlindeman/what-do-we-do-when-life-gets-in-the-way-of-our-dreams>What Do We Do When Life Gets in the Way of Our Dreams?</a> by @leahlindeman in <a href=https://steemit.com/trending/introduction>introduction</a></li>\n<li>01-09 <a href=https://steemit.com/savings/@sgnsteems/a-tale-of-a-couponer-the-beginning>A Tale of a Couponer- The Beginning</a> by @sgnsteems in <a href=https://steemit.com/trending/savings>savings</a></li>\n<li>01-09 <a href=https://steemit.com/politics/@heretickitten/abortion-your-body-your-choice-or-is-it-the-child-s-body-that-you-are-choosing-for>Abortion: Your body, your choice?

    "body": "# Happy September. #\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/3wokqy0mf/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s15.postimg.org/3jx6kricr/image.jpg' border='0' alt='image'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/'>\n\n**I know others on this website have said this, so I'm not the first, but yeah, I quit my job to write for Steemit.** \n\nActually, though, that's not entirely true. It's kind of true. I quit my job because something shifted inside of me. When the job was gone, Steemit, on the selfsame day, rose up into my focus immediately to fill the void like it was just waiting for me to finally get real. To do this stuff I've always been wanting to do. And always *have been doing* at the expense of sleep, money, time, etc. I was now beginning to get *paid for it.* What the!?!\n\n**The first half of August was bliss.** After some initial discouragement, I found some good verbs in the mouth of one Sterlin Luxan, and was inspired to actually dig down inside of myself and make a more [honest post.](https://steemit.com/steemit/@kafkanarchy84/why-i-have-quit-five-jobs-in-the-past-six-years-a-steemit-confessional) I finally made twenty bucks on the site. From there I thought, hell, I'll just do this full time. I began to make significant sums of cash for an honest day's worth of work writing, and felt that with my side job,  as long as I hammered down, I would be able to cover my family's usual expenses by the time September rolled around.\n\n\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/wk9d1kjsx/image.jpg\n*Spending time with my son has been one of the biggest bonuses of leaving my 9-5.*\n# **Well. August 31st. Paying all my bills with SBDs? No such luck, my friend.** # \n\nBut I will tell you one thing. I never dreamed I could pull down 2Gs cold, hard cash through writing in less than a month, even if one half of it is still vested in Steem Power (I am happy about this). I was sick to my stomach, though. I have a wife and a child. Playing games at this point was not an option. Still....I had heard something that was very lovely and very clear.\n\nIt was a kind of feeling I have never had before, but which was also at once very perfectly familiar. As my kid is playing on the Octopus slide behind me, and I am staring out at the sea, it hits me:  ***It's over. You will never teach kids again.***\n\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/4xqdopsip/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s16.postimg.org/dfztt1z1h/image.jpg' border='0' alt='image'/><br />\n\n**Weird. It's like my wish, but this time I am not even wishing for it. It comes to me. I just know that that chapter of my life is completed. That was the day after I quit my job.**\n\n**Fast forward to the end of the month.** I haven't made enough money like I had hoped....I pray to someone or something over my Matsuya beef bowl in the sketchy back alley district of the burlesque dancers: *what should I do?* I was really, really feeling low and full of doubts and self-accusations.\n\nImmediately that silly voice came back again: \n # *(Keep doing what you're doing)* #\n\nI haven't been eating this month. Haven't been sleeping. Have had headaches. Upset stomach. Welcome to fear. Welcome to the real shit. You were so cocky! Are you lazy!? You didn't like your job but so what!? You've got a family!!! Son comes home from daycare. *DAAAAADDDYYYYYY!!!!!!! Let's play!!!!!*\n\nPull yourself together.\nDon't show your frayed nerves.\n\n**My wife is equally worried.**\nShe needs security. She wants to get into massage. Vocal training school. So many dreams. Here I am sitting around the house in my underwear when all I really want to do is hand her a big fat envelope full of money.\n\nhttps://s17.postimg.org/56h7g4qxb/image.jpg\n\n**I've never been lazy. I will work my ass off when I care, and when I need to.** Fuck sleep. Fuck food. Fuck everything but the goal. \n\n# I just can't seem to give a damn about most shit that everybody else says is important. #\nWell, a lot of shit, at least. Still. Mouths to feed, my friend. But that \"voice,\" didn't it mean something? And despite the nerves, hasn't this been one of the happiest, most productive months of my life? Yes. Yes, and yes. Besides, the other job was no good. Bad, unsustainable situation. You know that, Graham.\n\nhttps://s15.postimg.org/i7lfk6hzv/image.jpg\n*My buddy Kevin shows up to the Local.*\n\n**Back to now, August, 31st, 2016. Evening. I went to my friend Craig's bar tonight.** At the depth of my despair, on the bus ride over, I received a mail from my other friend, Aidan. There might be some part time work at his school. Mail sounds promising. \n\nAfter a couple beers at Craig's place it is settled I will work Saturdays mixing booze and playing guitar. I am starting to feel good again. It is starting to seem possible that I can build my own, full-time, part-time \"Steem-lance\" schedule. [Fake priest weddings](https://steemit.com/religion/@kafkanarchy84/my-life-as-a-fake-priest-true-believer), English classes, serving beer and singing....and....\n\n# STEEEEEEEEEEEEMMMMMM!!!!!!! #\n\nAnd you know what? \n\nI am going to document it every step of the way. This is the first episode. Hope to see you next time, from my first day on the job as a bartender. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/jasziAzaiZ4\n\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/rjlhw49rp/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s18.postimg.org/aj2lnfwqh/image.jpg' border='0' alt='image'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/'>\n\nhttps://s17.postimg.org/yb9pkx39b/image.jpg\n*Basically how I feel now that I have discovered Steemit.com*\n\nPeace, Love, and Anarchy,\n\n~KafkA\n\nP.S. Another thing I have never been good at is keeping a consistent diary. I'm too private, and can't be bothered, even for myself. Should \"My Steemit Life\" transform into an existentialist thought stream ramble resembling a blog-turned-extended-acid trip, please forgive me. Maybe I will commit to  5 episodes. That sounds like a good number to me. Deal?\n\n***\n*Graham Smith is a Voluntaryist activist residing in Niigata, Japan.*",

We see, feel, taste, hear and smell unknowingly how it works. As we were children we called anything into question and now accept reality as it is. We lost the magic in all these wonderful things. This series addresses the wonder of natures and will bring its magic back to light. The first part of the <strong>Life Explorers - The Human Senses </strong>starts with the sense of sight. We see forms and colors, see bright and dark. But why?<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To be able to answer this question we first need to have look at the nature off light. Light is a form of electromagnetic (EM) radiation, to be accurate we need to speak of visible light because only a small portion of the actual EM spectrum is visible to the human eye. The following illustration shows the EM spectrum. Frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional, the shorter the wavelength the higher the frequency. With higher frequencies the amount of energy is rising, this is for instance the reason why Gamma Rays are deadly. The high energy of the gamma rays are devastating for biological cells as they are ionizing and cause secondary radiation like X-Rays or electron diffraction. E= h \u2022 f is formula which depicts the proportionality of <strong>E</strong> energy and <strong>f</strong> frequency (<strong>h</strong> stands for the Planck constant). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here a little example for the energy of a short and a long wavelength.&nbsp;</p>\n <table>\n      <tr>\n        <td>red</td>\n        <td>E=h \u2022 f = 6,626 070 040 \u00b7 10\u221234 J*s * 384 THz</td>\n        <td>1,59 eV</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>violet</td>\n        <td>E=h \u2022 f = 6,626 070 040 \u00b7 10\u221234 J*s * 789 THz</td>\n        <td>3,26 eV</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n<center><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/uajq64zo1/emspectrumvis.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"766\"/></center>\n<center><em>Fig. 1. The electromagnetic spectrum. Source: </em><a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/32344-what-are-x-rays.html\"><em>Livescience</em></a></center>\n<p>As shown above the visible light is only a tiny portion of the EM spectrum. The human eye is able to see colors from red to violet, which is equivalent to wavelengths from 780nm to 380nm (nm = nanometer).</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>Why do is the Steemit logo blue and not red?</strong></h3>\n<center><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/isgrqldc9/steemitlogo.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\"/></center>\n<p>Sure because @dantheman and @ned decided so :) But on a scientific base, how come we see blue and not another color?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now that we know what visible light is let\u2019s have a look at the interaction of EM radiation and the objects we see. The actual color we perceive depends on the physical principle of reflection and adsorption. &nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nMost objects reflect light but before that happens they adsorb part of the light they receive. The wavelength they adsorb determines what your eye will process later. For instance when all wavelengths expect red (780nm) are adsorbed the object will reflect red. Same goes for a blue steemit logo for instance. The logo absorbs all wavelengths expect the blue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More than one wavelength can be reflected the same time, this therefore is why we see shades of the same color. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/eajm6sv8r/prismandrgb.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"337\"/></center>\n<p>We can see purple color when blue and red are reflected wavelengths. We see white when an object absorbs no light. &nbsp;<br>\nIsaac Newton showed that white light contains all colors. He used a prism to separate the colors of spectrum of visible light. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>How does reflection and adsorption work? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>To understand how adsorption works we need to have a closer look into the chemistry of molecules. As described light hitting an object, here molecule, is adsorbed and we see the complementary color as a result. The following abbreviations will be used: HOMO = Highest occupied molecule orbital and LUMO = Lowest unoccupied molecule orbital. Carrots are orange, but why? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/5q33u4jup/steemcarrot.jpg\" width=\"634\" height=\"800\"/></center>\n<p>Electrons are moving in a certain space around the nucleus, called orbitals. The energy of light promotes an electron from a bonding or non-bonding orbital into an empty anti-bonding orbital, from HOMO to LUMO. The gap between these two orbitals is equivalent to the amount of energy that is needed to promote the electrons. A larger gap therefore requires light with more energy, for instance blue or violet. The chemical molecule that gives the carrot its orange color is called beta-carotene. Beta-carotene absorbs light between 400nm and 500nm with a peak at 470nm. Having a look at our additive color schema we will see that the complementary color of blue is yellow. Now is that not only blue, but a wide range of light between 400nm and 500nm is absorbed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/h90irk9s7/carotene.gif\" width=\"518\" height=\"150\"/></center>\n<p>So when light hits the electrons of beta-carotene the electrons move from HOMO to LUMO and adsorb the light between 400nm and 500nm. This is the wavelength needed to promote the electron with the exact amount to energy needed. &nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/uot71t3j3/homolumo.png\" width=\"619\" height=\"217\"/></center>\n<p>Note: The electron moves back from LUMO to HOMO. The energy from the light used to promote the electron from HOMO to LUMO can be emitted in form of radiation or heat. In summer we all notice that black material gets warmer than bright. This is because the complete wavelength of the VIS is absorbed and emitted as heat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Transforming waves to information &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Now that we know how the light is absorbed by objects we need to examine how our eyes work. Without the human eye we wouldn\u2019t see anything, that\u2019s for sure. But how are we able to distinguish colors and brightness? Our retina has approximately 6 million cones and 120 million rods. When the reflected light hits our retina these cells become active. <br>\n We have three different type of cone cells, S(-hort), M-(medium) and L-(ong) cones. Short, medium and long refer to the wavelength the cell is responding to. The rods however can work with different wavelengths and thus do not matter when it comes to color. They are responsible for brightness and become active when there is less light. While the cones are active and working we speak of photopic vision, responsible for color sight. Scotopic vision is the terminus for sight in low light and only seeing in shades of gray. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/vi5wzz509/retina.jpg\" width=\"914\" height=\"430\"/></center><center><em>Fig. 2. Eye and retinal profile. Source: </em><a href=\"http://cdn.kevinmd.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/retina.jpg\"><em>Kevinmd</em></a></center>\n<p>As described the human retina has three kinds of cones. Each sensitive to a different wavelength. The following illustrations depicts the relation of wavelength and cones. These three cones together make it possible that we see colors. By combining cones we are able to see over 200 million different colors. &nbsp;</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/jxtaq6apr/conesrods.jpg\" width=\"1225\" height=\"800\"/></center><center><em>Fig. 3. Spectral sensitivity of the receptor (rods and cones). Source: </em><a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sensory_Systems/Visual_System\"><em>Wikibooks; Sensory Systems</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></center>\n<h3><strong>So when light hits a cone it becomes activated. How does this activation work?</strong><br>\n&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>This is a very complex biochemical process I will try to explain without going too much into detail since we could do several posts just about this process. However we will have a look at the basic. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both, cones and rods contain a light-sensitive receptor protein called Rhodopsin, also known as visual purple. Under the influence of light Rhodopsin decomposes into Opsin and trans-Retinal. This process repeats and creates a cascade. The end of the processes results in regulating a molecule named Glutamat. The cells behind the retina turn these signals into nerve impulses to make it processable for the human brain. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for reading the first part of </em><em><strong>Life Explorers - The Human Senses,</strong></em><em> Don't miss the next part. <br>\nDo you have an questions or suggestions?

They look at one figure inside the class within their vision and that make the view limited in their eyes. But let switch the roles and try to see how the teacher look at their student in that big vision. Looking to a speaker is different than observing the reader. Chapter one in the book \u201cTeachers, Schools, and Society\u201d by David Miller Sadker and Karen R. Zittleman, discuss how teacher scenery is different from that of student and it guides the reader to find the positive and negative points for a teacher to encounter in his career; it will help reader to discover whether they should complete aiming for to become a teacher.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal for every reader is to find and choose the best career that will find happiness and bring the joy while practicing it. That\u2019s what makes the chapter more comfortable to read in; it didn\u2019t force the material on the reader but instead, it gives suggestions and real life examples about how being a teacher would look like. \u201cYou be the Judge\u201d is whole examples for a student to know how being a teacher could have a negative or positive impact on their lives, and it\u2019s a good way to them clarify their position whether to continue with being a teacher as a career meant to them or not convinced by. Also, there was a survey in the chapter that shows how many teachers get paid yearly in different states; it\u2019s a good side to the students to know that being a teacher could provide a decent life for them as a job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers need to have a bunch of specification in orders to be called a successor. Preparing a teacher to this career and guiding them to be effective to his class is an important step that could impact the whole future of both teachers and learner. That idea of preparation considers as an informative process and not implicit, and it\u2019s a good topic that's been clarified in that chapter. Moreover, another idea that been addressed at the end of the chapter is how the student could improve his skills and concepts of the learning process before graduation, and that been shown with listing several steps that the student should put into consideration in order to become successful and creative. It does not only help the learner himself in the long run but also give a chance to make his future classes more creative and cooperative at the time. For instance, some of the steps say that the teacher should study their courses that the handle carefully and planned for them ahead to make sure it\u2019s clear to him and would be to students at the time. Also, they should have a good impression during their learning process and to keep on building it on. That\u2019s how a student could have some ideas to consider and to begin with if they are struggling with what to start with or improve while they are still learning about their career.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students should figure out if the teaching career is the one that meant to them and they will enjoy practicing end for most of their life. That chapter did a good job in discussing some topic that will help the student take their decision regarding this career and if they willing to take that challenge and start filling and building their knowledge. It does not only help the student to become successful teachers but also prepare them to make a more bright future for the generation they will be willing to teach, and to be creative with their work and thoughts. So, after knowing and considering what a teacher need to handle and think of, the student will start to find their own way to teach and make their job process different from other teachers they encounter before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

Many projects are being launched, &nbsp;and the whales are putting in a lot of effort to notice the new aspiring writers.</p>\n<p>I have changed my view on things now, &nbsp;I make a point to read as many posts as possible. I comment if needed, and I upvote a post if I find it interesting. We are not in a race here. We are after all in the business of finding new undiscovered talent and to be heard. Now, also said, that what interests me, <em><strong>might not be interesting to you at all.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p>What I have noticed is that there are quite a few nasty people on steemit. I am certainly not going to call them by their names, but I really feel sorry for these people, as they would not give someone the time of day.</p>\n<p><em>I felt very offended by some of the comments made about my post, but realised that negative feedback can be changed into a positive view.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><strong>I do not promote or upvote a post just for the sake of upvoting.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I &nbsp;do my fair share by reading as many posts as possible about my interests.&nbsp;</strong>Now, also said, that what interests me, <em><strong>might not be interesting to you at all.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>But people are just people.</strong></em>............people&nbsp;should try and upvote the good posts and promote these writers, so we can have new and exciting reading material here on Steemit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you do not succeed today, tomorrow is a new day. Try harder. Do not let negative comments make you lose your way. Don't give up. <em><strong>Stay positive.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Because if you are noticed by the right person, then your posts will mean something. Then you will have a voice.</strong></em></p>\n<p>I am totally up for a good debate and if you don't agree with me on posts, then&nbsp;feel free to contact me and we can discuss your opinion. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If you like my posts please follow me on<a href=\"https://steemit.com/@serioustruth\">@serioustruth</a><br>\nTogether we can change the world. Feel free to share or promote my posts. I want to make a difference to the way people think.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2764<strong>Keep on steeming!</strong></p>\n</html>",

Well, as we shall come to see, it didn\u2019t. But, to the extent that some modern Literalists believe that there is a single agreed-upon, infallible book of scripture, it is due, in their view, to the concept of \u201cdivine inspiration\u201d\u2014the idea that God\u2019s hand directed both the writing and the compilation of the Bible over hundreds of years.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But, is this idea of divine inspiration a reasonable one? As suggested in the prior chapter, if God had intended for us to look to a history book for our spiritual salvation, he certainly should have, dare I say would have, made his intentions plainer, no? As Professor Ehrman notes:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It is one thing for believers to affirm, on theological grounds, that the decisions about the canon, like the books themselves, were divinely inspired, but it is another thing to look at the actual history of the process and to ponder the long, drawn-out arguments over which books to include and which to reject. The process did not take a few months or years. It took centuries. And even then there was no unanimity. (Lost Christianities at 230)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Because few lay Christians have ever done so, let\u2019s examine this drawn-out process in more detail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>The Gospels</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Much of the early arguments over the Bible centered upon which gospels should be included, and which excluded, from the New Testament. After all, as previously noted, there were far more gospels in circulation than merely the four known to our Bibles today:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>The greatest difficulty was in choosing the Gospels, and after much controversy, four were chosen: three, those of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are synopses of Jesus\u2019 life, while John\u2019s Gospel concentrates on a few specific miracles performed by Christ. (Solomon J. Schepps, Foreward to the 1979 edition of Lost Books of the Bible at 9)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Limiting the Gospels to only four was very important to some early Literalist leaders, although other Literalists and most Gnostics opposed this limitation, and the rationale for it was strained at best.</strong> Irenaeus, who we met in the last chapter, was one of the earliest and most vehement proponents of a four gospel canon, arguing that, \u201cit is not possible that there can be more or fewer than four\u201d for \u201c just as there are four regions of the universe, and four principal winds\u201d there must be only four gospels. Though hardly compelling, this rationale has been frequently cited over the centuries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Later orthodox Literalists, who ultimately assumed control over the selection process (as we will discuss below), did offer more rational justifications for limiting the gospels to four: They deemed some of the additional ones to be merely supplementary or redundant and therefore unnecessary, while they viewed others, particularly those without a Literalist bent, as outright heretical:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Of the accounts of the life of Jesus that were rejected by the Fathers, many were considered supplementary rather than false. Such was the case with the Gospels of Peter and Nicodemus and the two accounts of Christ\u2019s infancy (I and II Infancy)\u2026.</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Peter\u2019s Gospel, which was once held as high as those of Matthew and Mark, and more highly than those of Luke and John, was ultimately rejected because it differs too much in its details from the three chosen synopses. The Gospel of Thomas, one of the Nag Hammadi documents, was rejected for a very different reason. It opens by saying that he who understand the words of Jesus will be saved. This, of course, is in direct contradiction to the chosen Gospels\u2026which say that it is he who believes that will be saved\u2026. (Forward to the 1979 edition of Lost Books of the Bible at 9-10)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>The last of the \u201cchosen\u201d gospels, often called the fourth gospel, was that of John. But the modern reader may be surprised to learn that many early Christians disapproved of it selection:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Even its first generation of readers disagreed as to whether John was a true gospel or a false one\u2014and whether it should be part of the New Testament. John\u2019s defenders among early Christians revered it as the \u201clogos gospel\u201d\u2014the gospel of the divine word or reason (logos, in Greek)\u2014and derided those who opposed it as \u201cirrational\u201d (alogos, lacking reason). Its detractors, by contrast, were quick to point out that John\u2019s narrative differs significantly from those of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. [A]t crucial moments in its account, for example, John\u2019s gospel directly contradicts the combined testimony of the other New Testament gospels. (Elaine Pagels, Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas at 34-35)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Even so, because it can be bent to a Literalist interpretation, John\u2019s gospel came to be accepted as canon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>By way of contrast, the Gospel of Peter--a book much prized by most early Christians, rivaling in popularity the Gospels of Matthew and Mark and exceeding Luke and John--was ultimately rejected because it lent itself to a potentially \u201cheretical\u201d interpretation known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism\">docetism</a>. Although it came in a variety of forms, docetism can be understood for purposes of this book as the belief that Christ\u2019s divine nature kept him from experiencing true pain and suffering during his life and death. Serapion (c. 199), the orthodox Bishop of Antioch, (c. 199), concluded that because the Gospel of Peter could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with orthodox teachings (which held that Jesus suffered in the ordinary sense), it could not have been written by the Apostle Peter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>While modern scholarship has confirmed that the Gospel of Peter was not written by the historical Peter, Serapion\u2019s rationale for dismissing it should concern those who assert the Bible\u2019s infallibility. Serapion discarded the book simply because he disagreed with it, not because he had any actual evidence or knowledge of forgery. Thus, in Serapion\u2019s approach we see the beginnings of an orthodox \u201clitmus test\u201d for determining the authenticity of early Christian manuscripts\u2014those that largely agreed with the orthodox position, or could be interpreted or easily edited to do so, were frequently held to be authentic, while those that outright contradicted orthodox views were always discarded as forgeries.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Renowned scholar Bruce M. Metzger, PhD, acknowledges that the compilers of the Bible applied just such a litmus test. According to Metzger, for a book to be considered canonical it must have met three tests:</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>First, the books must have had apostolic authority\u2014that is, they must have been written either by apostles themselves, who were eyewitnesses to what they wrote about, or by followers of apostles.</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>[S]econd, there was the criterion of conformity to what was called the rule of faith. That is, was the document congruent with the basic Christian tradition that the [orthodox] church recognized as normative?&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>And third, there was the criterion of whether a document had had continuous acceptance and usage by the church at large. [Quoted in The Case For Christ at 66]</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>Other scholars have noted that the litmus test came in four parts rather than three, recognizing an additional requirement that the book be \u201cancient\u201d. But regardless, it is the second test, the \u201crule of faith\u201d, that is most intriguing to critical scholars.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>The \u201crule of faith\u201d, sometimes called the \"standard of faith\" rested on the now questionable assumption that the orthodox view of Christianity represented the exclusive authentic tradition.</strong> Under this standard, any early Christian document that contradicted the orthodox understanding was considered by the orthodox Literalists of the second and third centuries to be a forgery. <strong>For instance, the Gospel of Peter met every prong of the orthodox litmus test noted above save one\u2014the \u201crule of faith\u201d. After all, it was ostensibly written by the Apostle Peter and it was widely used and considered authentic by a great number of Christians, proving itself to be even more popular than Luke or John. The simple fact is that we don\u2019t read the Gospel of Peter in our Bibles today only because parts of it could not be reconciled with certain orthodox teachings and, as we shall see, it was the orthodox who compiled our Bibles.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Perhaps this rationale for excluding the Gospel of Peter and other books is acceptable to those who take it on faith that the orthodox tradition was the true and complete one, but it is troublesome for those who know otherwise. After all, <strong>the reasoning employed by the early orthodox is circular: \u201cWe\u2019re right and they are wrong\u201d, contended the orthodox leaders who compiled our Bibles. \u201cSo those manuscripts that agree with us are obviously authentic, while those that do not are certainly forgeries. Therefore we shall create a collection of the \u2018authentic\u2019 teachings, and then we can point to the authenticity of this collection as proof that our interpretation of Christianity is the right one.\u201d One doesn\u2019t have to be a logician to find the holes in that reasoning.</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>The Letters</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the debate over the Bible wasn\u2019t limited to the Gospels alone, but included the New Testament letters (epistles) as well. Several of the epistles in our present-day Bibles were not well respected by important early Christians, even some Literalist ones. <strong>In Origen\u2019s (c. 210) catalogue of New Testament scriptures, the Epistles of James and Jude are omitted, and Origen notes that many Christians were skeptical of 2 Peter and 2 and 3 John. More than a hundred years later, Eusebius (c. 315) states that some Christians of his time still doubted or outright rejected the authenticity of these same five books. Eusebius himself considered Revelation to be spurious. Jerome (c. 382) spoke dubiously of the epistle to the Hebrews. As late as the fifth century, the Syrian church venerated only 22 books, excluding 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude and Revelation. By contrast, the present day Ethiopian church accepts all twenty-seven books of our present day New Testament, but adds four more.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>The famous fourth century teacher known as Didymus the Blind was among those who believed that 2nd Peter was a forgery. Interestingly though, he cited the Shepard of Hermas and other noncanonical books favorably.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>The last book of the Bible, Revelation, is not included in the various catalogues of the New Testament offered by such notable early Christians as Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 340); the Bishops at the Council of Caudices (c. 364); Gregory Nazianzen, Bishop of Constantinople (c. 375); and Philastrius, Bishop of Brixia in Venice (c. 380).&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>In short, as late at 400 CE there was no accepted, universal canon of Christian scripture. And, as we shall soon see, there still isn\u2019t even today.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Forgery, Forgery Everywhere</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Forgery was commonly practiced in ancient times, so early Christians had reason to be skeptical when their opponents pointed to various manuscripts to \"cinch\" their argument. And as we shall see, we have even more reasons to be skeptical of these same manuscripts today.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Arguing in support of the integrity of our modern Bibles, Literalists often cite the research of critical scholars who have proven many of the excluded texts, such as the once-prized Gospel of Peter, to be forgeries (i.e., it was not really written by the historical Peter). But, these Literalists overlook the fact that these very same scholars have also shown several of our New Testament letters to be forgeries:</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Scholars have long recognized that even some of the books accepted into the canon are probably forgeries. Christian scholars, of course, have been loathe to call them that and so more commonly refer to them as \u201cpseudonymous\u201d writings. Possibly this is a more antiseptic term, but its does little to solve the problem of a potential deceit, for an author who attempts to pass off his own writing as that of some other well-know person has written a forgery. That is no less true of the book allegedly written to Titus that made it into the New Testament (Paul\u2019s Letter to Titus) than of the book allegedly written by Titus that did not (Pseudo-Titus), both claiming to be written by apostles (Paul and Titus), both evidently written by someone else. (Ehrman, Lost Christianities at 9)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>In fact, all of Paul\u2019s New Testament \u201cPastoral letters\u201d--1 and 2 Timothy and Titus--are now known to have been written long after Paul\u2019s death, very likely in the late first century. &nbsp;Among the New Testament books attributed to Paul, only Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, 1 Thessalonians, Philippians, Romans, and Philemon are universally recognized by critical and \u201cfaithful\u201d scholars alike as authentic.</strong> Ephesians, Colossians and 2 Thessalonians are sometimes disputed, but the definite consensus of critical scholars is that they are either fabrications or severely edited versions of some now lost originals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Although I cannot document here all of the various, compelling reasons why critical scholars are so sure that many New Testament epistles are faked, I will take a moment here discuss the Pastorals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In addition to the skepticism expressed by early prominent Christians and church fathers like those noted in the previous section above, the earliest extant catalogue of Paul\u2019s letters makes no mention at all of the Pastorals. Indeed, there is no evidence of their existence prior to c. 190 when Irenaeus conveniently makes mention of them. And yet, even despite these references by Irenaeus, Eusebius (c. 300), the so-called \u201cFather of Church History\u201d, does not include the Pastorals in his catalogue of the books of sacred scripture, even though he definitely knew of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But modern scholars have many additional reasons for doubting the authenticity of the Pastorals. For one, they curiously reference aspects of church structure and hierarchical governance that, although favored by the orthodox, did not exist during Paul\u2019s lifetime. The structure of church governance discussed in the Pastorals (a top-down hierarchy) is in many ways inconsistent and irreconcilable with the organizational structure of Paul\u2019s churches described in his authentic writings (which took a more democratic, bottom-up presbyterian approach).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Additionally, the vocabulary and tone of the Pastorals is curious. They use a number of words not found elsewhere in Paul\u2019s authentic writings, and specifically contradict the teachings of the known authentic writings on many points. Not surprisingly, these points of contradiction typically advance an orthodox understanding of Christianity, with the Pastorals apparently serving to \u201cclarify\u201d those parts of Paul\u2019s authentic writings that lent themselves to a Gnostic, \"heretical\" interpretation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>For these and other reasons, critical scholars are in near unanimous agreement that the Pastorals are second century forgeries, and rather poor ones at that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Circumstantial Evidence of Forgery</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Although the most \u201cfaithful\u201d of Literalist attempt to dispute the direct evidence of forgery noted above--rationalizing, for example, that the unusual vocabulary of the Pastorals might be attributable to the fact that Paul may have dictated his various letters at different times to different scribes who sometimes paraphrased him (while nonetheless perfectly preserving his \"divinely inspired\" message, we are assured)--<strong>there can be no dispute on the following point: To advance their cause, certain highly educated proto-orthodox forgers authored letters in the names of the Apostles or their followers, letters that their descendants eventually excluded from the Bible for one reason or another. </strong>For example, as mentioned previously, some orthodox sympathizer forged a letter from Titus, now called \u201cPseudo-Titus\u201d (meaning \u201cfalse Titus\u201d), that is not found in our New Testament. Extra-biblical documents forged in the name of the Apostle Paul include 3 Corinthians (created in the second century largely in order to undermine the docetic \u201cheresy\u201d, it was eventually accepted as canonical only by the Armenian church and certain Syrian churches), several letters from Paul to the Roman philosopher Seneca (designed to cast Paul as a great philosopher), and at least one to the church at Laodicea. Yet other known Pauline forgeries are lost to history\u2014we know them only because they are referenced in ancient writings that have been preserved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Faithful readers should not be surprised that all these letters were being forged in Paul\u2019s name. After all, 2 Thessalonians (2:2) records that Paul was concerned that people were forging letters in his name even in his own time. However:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>In an interesting twist, scholars today are not altogether confident that 2 Thessalonians itself was written by Paul. And so we have a neat irony: either 2 Thessalonians was written by Paul and someone else was producing forgeries in Paul\u2019s name, or 2 Thessalonians itself is a forgery that condemns the production of forgeries in Paul\u2019s name. Either way, someone was forging books in Paul\u2019s name. (Lost Christianities at 10)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Although these undisputed forgeries weren\u2019t included in our New Testaments, to the relief of many Literalists, their mere existence casts additional doubt on many of the books that did. These extra-biblical forgeries prove indisputably that some early, highly-educated proto-orthodox sympathizers--members of the very group whose spiritual descendants ultimately organized and canonized the New Testament as Holy Writ (as we shall see)--were ready, willing, and able to employ deceit to advance their cause and to undermine the authority of their Christian opponents, going even so far as to forge letters in the name of key Apostles. Even the Catholic Encyclopedia admits as much: \"Both Catholics and Gnostics were concerned in writing these fictions. The former had no motive other than that of pious fraud.\" Gnostic forgeries were then presumably \"impious frauds.\"&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Combine this known and admitted propensity for forgery with the doctrine-based litmus test later adopted by their descendants for purposes determining the authenticity of ancient Christian documents, and it would be a divinely inspired miracle indeed if some forgeries didn\u2019t make it into our New Testaments.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>So, even if we ignore the all-but-conclusive direct evidence of forgery within our New Testament, we have compelling circumstantial evidence as well: We know with certainty that the Literalist Church had the means to commit forgery, as evidenced by, among other things, their extant forgeries that did not make it into the New Testament. We also know that the Literalists had the motive to forge documents and include them in the canon (e.g., by forging documents in Apostles\u2019 names and designating those documents as the infallible Word of God, Literalists would gain an advantage in the battles for the heart and soul of early Christianity). Finally, Literalists had the opportunity to include forged documents in the Bible: A century or two after these documents were forged, the spiritual descendants of these Literalist forgers attempted to \"close the cannon\" and adpoted a doctrine-based litmus test of authenticity that all but assured some forged documents would be canonized.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In light of this evidence, it is only the most \u201cfaithful\u201d of Christians who deny that parts of the New Testament are obvious forgeries. Sadly, such \u201cfaithfulness\u201d borders on irrationality: It is not merely \u201cevidence of things unseen\u201d (as Paul defined faith), but the irrational rejection of things seen plainly. It is not merely an acceptance of the unprovable, but acceptance in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Why should anyone have such faith? More importantly, why would a benevolent, loving God have made such irrational faith a precondition of salvation? I can think of no reason at all, but I can, and have, identified many reasons why less than benevolent, power-driven humans did so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Bibles, Bibles Everywhere</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Even if we ignore the known forgeries in the New Testament, there are many other problems with Literalist claims of the Bible's infallibility. One is that, as previously alluded, there is simply no such thing as the Bible. <strong>Over centuries what we now call the Bible has undergone numerous changes, and \"the\" church has never enjoyed a definitive version. </strong>For example, the identity of the books comprising the Old Testament has changed over the years, the Apocrypha was dropped from the Protestant Bible altogether after the Council of Trent (1545-1563) and, as we have seen, the books of the New Testament weren\u2019t fixed until the late fourth century or early fifth century, and even then there still wasn\u2019t complete unanimity in Christendom. <strong>The Catholic Encyclopedia admits, \"The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning...has no foundation in history.\"&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Another problem with claims of biblical infallibility is that, even today (and ignoring disputes over which books are canonical) we have numerous versions of \u201cthe\u201d Bible. <strong>Just since the King James Version was first published in the early 1600\u2019s, English speaking peoples have seen more than three hundred English translations of the Bible alone! </strong>A trip to the local bookstore will acquaint the reader with some of these, and a somewhat more comprehensive listing can be found here.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>So, why the need for so many Bibles?</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>Well, different versions exist for two primary reasons: (1) scholars disagree about which of the ancient manuscripts should be translated into our modern Bibles, and (2) translators disagree as to how to properly translate a given manuscript into a language understandable by modern audiences. Let\u2019s discuss each of these disagreements, beginning with the last one first.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Difficult Translations</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Jesus and his immediate followers, like most Jews of Palestine for centuries before them, spoke Aramaic, a language that is all but dead today. However, the oldest complete New Testament manuscripts still in existence are all written in an ancient form of Greek, called \u201cKoine\u201d, and all of these oldest manuscripts are \u201cuncials\u201d, meaning that they are written in only capital Greek letters with no spaces between words, no line breaks, and almost no punctuation marks\u2014i.e., no periods, no commas, no page breaks, and no exclamation points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>These facts are important for several reasons. First, they demonstrate that, with only a few exceptions, even the oldest existing copies of the New Testament capture the words of Jesus and the Apostles only in translated form. </strong>We do not know the actual words that were originally spoken by Jesus and his Apostles in Aramaic, rather we have only a Greek hearsay translation. And, unfortunately, something is always lost in translation: As Rabbi Judah eloquently stated, \u201cHe who translates a biblical verse literally is a liar, but he who elaborates on it is a blasphemer.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The translator\u2019s job is to express in language understandable to his audience the meaning of words originally spoken or written by someone else using a different language. Given linguistic differences in grammar, syntax, punctuation and figures of speech, this is no easy task under the best of circumstances\u2014but, Bible translators face additional complications. NAMELYTHEYARECHARGEDWITHACCURATELYTRANSLATINGANCIENTMANUSCRIPTSTHATAREWRITTENINALLCAPSDEVOIDOFPUNTUATIONORSPACESANDTHATWEREWRITTENTHOUSANDSOFYEARSAGOINLANGUAGEORDIALECTSTHATHAVEBEENDEADFORCENTURIES.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>If that last \"all caps\" sentence didn\u2019t make any sense, it is only because I wrote it in uncial form in hopes of giving the reader some appreciation for the difficult task of translating ancient uncials. Here\u2019s what I actually said: \u201cNamely they are charged with accurately translating ancient manuscripts that were written in all caps, which are virtually devoid of punctuation marks or spaces, and that were written thousands of years ago in languages or dialects that have been dead for centuries.\" If the reader had difficulty making sense of the \"all caps\" phrase above (even though it was written in modernEnglish), imagine how much greater the difficulty of interpreting a dead, foreign language written in such a manner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The first step in any translation of an ancient document is to develop an understanding of the original author\u2019s intent. As anyone who has ever attempted to interpret a document knows, this is more art than science, especially when the original author has been dead for two millennia, came from a foreign culture, and spoke a dead language. Given the difficultly that each present day generation has in understanding the next one (and vice versa), imagine how much more difficult it must be for a modern translator to truly see the world through the eyes of a first century writer from another culture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>In short, despite their best efforts, a translator\u2019s presuppositions (paradigms) affect his or her understanding of the original writer\u2019s intent, and therefore taint his or her interpretation of the original writer\u2019s words. The Preface to the New King James Version of the Bible, which is itself \u201cthe fifth revision of a historic document translated from specific Greek texts\u201d, is to be commended for acknowledging as much explicitly:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>[T]he most important differences in the English New Testaments of today are due\u2026to the way in which translators view the task of translation: How literally should the [original] text be rendered? How does the translator view the matter of biblical inspiration? Does the translator adopt a paraphrase when a literal rendering would be quite clear and more to the point?\u201d [parentheticals and emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>In other words, as the preface to the New King James version makes clear, the meaning of the translated Bible varies according to the particular translator\u2019s presuppositions, including whether or not the translator presupposes that the Bible is a spiritual book written by mortals, or a divinely inspired book of history. Or, said another way, the Paradigm of Historicity affects the translation! In this manner, centuries of translator bias (until very recently, almost exclusively Literalist ones) have been not-so-subtly incorporated into the substance of the most Bible versions available to us today. We will expose many of these as we proceed.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Assuming a translator can overcome the first challenge of truly understanding the intent of the original writer, the second step in translation is to then render the that understanding in language comprehensible to the translator\u2019s audience. The Christian William Tyndale was the first translator to offer an English Bible (c. 1526) derived from the most ancient Greek manuscripts available at the time (rather than later Latin manuscripts that had served as the basis for most previous translations). For this, he was eventually burned at the stake for heresy. Even so, many of his words survive to this day. It was Tyndale who, via artful translation, created from whole cloth many of the most memorable words and phrases found in our modern Bibles:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It was Tyndale who established \u2026that the Bible should not be in the language of scholars but in the spoken language of the people. [H]e coined such words as \u201cPassover,\u201d \u201cscapegoat,\u201d \u201cmercy seat,\u201d and \u201clong-suffering.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote><br></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Many expressions of Tyndale are also unforgettable, cherished by countless readers of the English Bible: \u201cthe kingdom of heaven is at hand\u201d (Matt. 3:2); \u201cthe pinnacle of the temple\u201d (Matt. 4:5); \u201cthe salt of the earth\u201d (Matt. 5:13); \u201cdaily bread\u201d (Matt. 6:11); \u201cConsider the lilies of the field, how they grow\u201d (Matt. 6:28); \u201cmeek and lowly in heart\u201d (Matt 11:29); \u201cshepherds abiding in the field\u201d (Luke 2:8); \u201ceat, drink, and be merry\u201d (Luke 12:19); \u201cfatted calf\u201d (Luke 15:23); \u201conly begotten son\u201d (John 1:14, 18); \u201cin my Father\u2019s house are many mansions\u201d (John 14:2); \u201cin whom we live and move and have our being\u201d (Acts 17:28); \u201cGod forbid\u201d (Rom 3:4); \u201csounding brass\u201d and \u201ctinkling cymbal\u201d (1 Cor. 13:1); \u201cin the twinkling of an eye\u201d (1 Cor. 15:52); \u201csinging and making melody (Eph. 5:19); \u201coffice of a bishop\u201d (1 Tim. 3:1); \u201cthe pleasures of sin for a season\u201d (Heb. 11:25); \u201can advocate with the Father\u201d (1 John 2:1); and \u201cBehold, I stand at the door and knock\u201d (Rev 3:20). (How We Got the Bible at 178-179)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Despite their familiarity, the above expressions do not appear in the original Greek, at least not in so many words:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>[I]t is noteworthy that these expressions could have been translated differently from the Greek text, yet because Tyndale had such an ear for the English language, these [para]phrases live on. [parentheticals added]. (How We Got the Bible at 179)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In short, as previously stated, something is always lost (and sometimes added)in translation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>An Important Diversion to Discuss Misleading Translations&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Before moving on to discuss the second primary reason that there are so many versions of the Bible\u2014namely, disagreements over which ancient documents to translate,--its worth pausing here to explore the significance of translator bias. <strong>Until very recently, virtually all Bible translations were overseen by committed Christians steeped in the Literalist, orthodox tradition. Even most of the so-called heretics of the last thousand years were, like William Tyndale, Literalists. Consequently, the Paradigm of Historicity, and all orthodox doctrines derived therefrom, weighed heavily on their efforts, and the biases of these original translators have influenced subsequent translations ever since.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Translators who presuppose that the Bible is the \u201cinspired\u201d word of God naturally \u201cview the task of translation\u201d, if only unconsciously, as supporting this idea.</strong> <strong>Such translators assume that God\u2019s inspired Word simply can\u2019t contradict itself or contain error. Thus, centuries of translators have adopted interpretations and translations that seek to reconcile or downplay inconsistencies or discrepancies that are evident in the original tongue. For example:</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>All of the Gospels present but one view of Jesus, that he is the Son of God. Yet in presenting this view their individual descriptions of him and his sayings often employ different words. Through the years, these verbal distinctions, either intentionally or unintentionally, tended to be \u201charmonized\u201d by the scribes. Thus it is a sound conclusion that in parallel accounts the text which preserves the minute verbal differences is generally the [more authentic] text. (How We Got the Bible at 93)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The result of this translator and scribal bias for consistency is that some parts of our modern Bibles appear to modern readers to be more of a coherent whole than they actually are, while other parts appear to less of a whole than they should. The following pages will provide numerous examples of the former, but here I will note one very basic example of the latter:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>\u201cJesus\u201d is the Greek rendering of the Hebrew name \u201cJoshua\u201d, meaning \u201csavior.\u201d It was a very common name among first century Jews. And yet it has become customary among translators to render the name of the Old Testament hero of Exodus as \u201cJoshua\u201d and that of the New Testament hero of the same name as \u201cJesus\u201d. Inconsistently translating these names adds to Jesus\u2019 uniqueness while at the same time obscuring certain similarities in the lives and actions of the two biblical heroes that may otherwise be obvious. The differing nomenclature discourages the reader from drawing analogies between the lives of the two figures, analogies that the authors of the gospels almost certainly intended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Translator bias has also served to obscure some striking similarities between the New Testament and other Gnostic scriptures. The Bible is almost always rendered in the familiar \u201cchurch speak\u201d originally adopted by Literalist translators over the centuries. However, it\u2019s important to understand that identical Greek words and ideas appearing in surviving Gnostic writings are typically rendered in unfamiliar \u201cpagan\u201d, heretical language, or simply left un-translated altogether, making these works seem more foreign, bizarre, and incredible than they should. To illustrate the point, let\u2019s consider just how strange, dare I say Gnostic, parts of the New Testament sound if we translate them from the Greek using the same principles often employed when translating Gnostic manuscripts.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Greek word for wisdom is \u201cSophia\u201d, which is also the name of the Greek goddess that personified the same. In Gnostic mythology, Sophia was the companion and lover of the Logos (often translated as \u201cword\u2019, which we will discuss more below), which all Christians equate with Christ (thanks to the opening chapter of the fourth gospel). This may be one reason why translators almost always translate the Greek word \u201cSophia\u201d as simply \u201cwisdom\u201d in the New Testament, but as \u201cSophia\u201d in most Gnostic texts. But is such inconsistent treatment justified? <strong>What happens, for example, when we translate some familiar Bible passages using principals of translation traditionally applied to Gnostic texts? Let\u2019s begin with words attributed to Paul in Colossians 1:8 (highlighted words are those that have been reworded using more consistently applied principles of translation, as is done with non-canonical books from the time):</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>We proclaim [Christ]\u2026teaching every man in the ways of Sophia that each may become an initiated member of Christ. (Colossians 1:28)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Translated in this manner, and remembering that in Gnostic theology, Sophia was the lover of the Logos (Christ), Paul sounds\u2026well\u2026radical. In essence, Paul teaches that we become one with Christ (that is, \u201cmembers\u201d of Christ) by learning the ways (i.e., assuming the role) of his mythical lover, Sophia. Though strange, this lesson is actually consistent with orthodox doctrine that the church is the \u201cbride of Christ\u201d, and it is also indistinguishable from the Gnostic teaching on this subject.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Continuing:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>My purpose is that they may\u2026become one in love, so that they may\u2026experience the Gnosis of God\u2019s mystery, namely, Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of Sophia and Gnosis. [emphasis added] (Colossians 2:2-3)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Here Paul teaches that mystical \u201coneness\u201d is achieved through Gnosis (or experiential knowledge) of God\u2019s \u201cmystery\u201d, which he defines as Christ. Christ is not discussed as an historical personage, but as a higher consciousness that, once identified with to the exclusion of our ego (i.e., once we become one with it), leads to spiritual insight\u2014hidden wisdom (Sophia) and knowledge (gnosis). This is pure Christian Gnosticism, plain and simple. Only the common misleading translation keeps us from seeing it as such.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Proceeding further:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>We speak of Sophia among the initiated; not the Sophia of this aeon, nor of the rulers of this aeon, who are passing away; but we speak of God\u2019s Sophia in a mystery. (1 Corinthians 2:6)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It is central to our faith that in the end we will all attain Oneness through Gnosis of God\u2019s Son, becoming fully initiated human beings, equal to nothing less than the pleroma of Christ. (Ephesians 4:13)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>\u201cGod\u2019s Sophia\u201d, \u201cinitiated\u201d, \u201cmystery\u201d, \u201caeons\u201d, \u201coneness\u201d and \u201cpleroma\u201d, all of these are quintessentially Gnostic terms, terms one would find repeated over and over in most any Christian Gnostic texts such as those found at Nag Hammadi. And yet, although they are expressed in the original Greek manuscripts of our Bibles, these terms are foreign to most Christians simply because bias, primarily the doctrine of divine inspiration and the Paradigm of Historicity, keeps translators from expressing Paul in this way. Rather than use the word \u201cinitiated\u201d, which is a more proper and accurate translation of the original Greek, and one they surely would have used if translating the same word in a Gnostic text, translators substitute the word \u201cmature.\u201d Rather than use the Greek word \u201cGnosis\u201d, which describes subjective, experiential knowledge (like knowing how to ride a bike) as opposed to objective, intellectual knowledge (like one plus one equals two), translators just use the more antiseptic (if somewhat misleading) English word \u201cknowledge\u201d, which has the added benefit of obscuring Paul\u2019s Gnostic tendencies.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Another example of a translation that obscures the similarities between the Gnostic texts and the New Testament is the rendering of logos in many Gnostic texts as logos, but in the New Testament as \u201cWord\u201d (such as in John 1:1) The Greek word logos, which is the root of the English word \u201clogic\u201d, has no strict English equivalent. It can be alternatively translated as \u201cword\u201d, \u201creason\u201d, or \u201cidea\u201d depending upon context, but it actually contains elements of all three, plus more. No one English word captures the true essence of the Greek logos.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In the centuries before and immediately after Jesus, \"logos\" was a term of art used by pagan philosophers and adepts of the Mysteries Religions, including the Christian Gnostics. They generally used it to describe the thoughts of God\u2019s Mind through which God created and sustains the universe, or said another way, the objects of God\u2019s consciousness. To put it in terms readily understandable to most present-day Literalist Christians, before God spoke the words \u201cLet there by light\u201d (Genesis 1:3), God had to first have the idea (logos) of light in mind, else his words would have had no meaning or effect. Because thought, which is made manifest in words, must precede action, Gnostics came to view God\u2019s thoughts/ideas/words as the true source and sustainer of all Creation, present with God \u201cin the beginning\u201d, for creation could not exist prior to God conceiving of it. These divine thoughts or ideas, which are separate from God and yet one with Him (in the same sense that our thoughts are separate from our minds yet have no existence outside of them) are the divine logos. It will serve our purposes sufficiently if we conceptualize the divine logos for now as God\u2019s consciousness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In Gnostic mythology, which the reader will recall contains much figurative language, creation is the result of the one transcendent God becoming consciousness of Himself. Exactly how this happened is a mystery symbolized in numerous and varying myths, but Gnostics reasoned rightly that consciousness requires both a subject and an object\u2014that is, there must be a witness (the person or thing that is conscious\u2014i.e., the \u201cmind\u201d) as well as the witnessed (i.e., the person or thing of which on is conscious, or the \u201cthought\u201d). In the Gnostic allegorical myths that seek to encode this truth, Gnostics often referred to the original witness (i.e., the \u201cmind\u201d of God) as \u201cthe Father\u201d. Likewise, they referred to the thoughts of that Divine Mind, the ideas which God\u2019s Mind contemplates, as \u201cthe Son\u201d or \u201cthe Logos\u201d (Word). Thus, thoughts (the Son) were conceptualized as the \u201coffspring\u201d or \u201cfirst born\u201d or \u201cbegotten\u201d of the mind (the Father), present with God at the dawn of creation. Before God thought, nothing was, for consciousness did not exist. Thus, Father and Son are as inseparable as thought is from mind. The Athanasian Creed expresses these ideas perfectly:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten, The Son is of the Father alone, neither made nor created, but begotten. [N]one is afore or after the other, none is greater or less than another.</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And, as Origen once noted, \u201cThe Father did not beget the Son, but ever is begetting him.\u201d</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>The experience of this simple idea was almost certainly part of the fundamental Inner Mystery taught by all Gnostic Mystery Schools in the centuries before and after Jesus. Centuries before Christ the pagan Gnostic Heraclitus (c. 600 BCE) wrote, \u201cThe Father and Son are the same.\u201d According to Clement of Alexandria, the pagan Gnostic Euripides had years before \u201cdivined as in a riddle that the Father and the Son are one God.\u201d The legendary pagan sage Orpheus, who lived, if at all, thousands of years before Christ, is quoted by the Christian Clement of Alexandria as having taught:&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Behold the Logos divine. Tread well the narrow path of life and gaze on Him, the world\u2019s great ruler, our immortal king. (Quoted in The Jesus Mysteries at 83)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Clement of Alexandria himself writes:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>The Son is the Consciousness of God. The Father only sees the world as reflected in the Son. (Quoted in The Jesus Mysteries at 84) [parentheticals added]</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Continuing with this idea for a moment, it is important to note that Gnostics sought to explain the mystery of human consciousness by characterizing it as fragmented, dispersed pieces of the One Divine Consciousness\u2014that is, of the Son or logos, which Christians specifically equate with Christ. How portions of the One Divine Consciousness came to be dismembered and encapsulated within each of us, how we lost our ability to \u201caccess\u201d or \u201crely on\u201d it in our daily lives, and how we can regain it, are all mysteries described allegorically in many Gnostic and Christian myths. For Christians, the most important of these myths are those describing the Incarnation of Christ (God\u2019s consciousness becoming encapsulated in man), the Fall of Man (man losing his ability to rely on that consciousness and instead being ruled by his unconscious paradigms and passions, which Paul called \u201cthe flesh\u201d), and Christ\u2019s Crucifixion and Resurrection (describing the way back to union with God, or oneness with the cosmic consciousness).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>These Gnostic teachings about the dispersion of human consciousness, and its reunion with God, may seem quite strange to Literalists, so I will again remind the reader of just a few of Paul\u2019s words on this subject:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>For just as the body is a unity and yet has many members, and all the members, though many , form only one body, so it is with Christ\u2026.[i.e., the logos or Son]. For by means of one shared Spirit [or consciousness] we were all baptized into one [spiritual] body\u2026.&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Now you (collectively) are Christ\u2019s body [i.e., the Logos, the One Divine Consciousness], and individually members [i.e., dispersed pieces] of it. (1 Corinthians 12:11-27)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It is inherent in our faith that in the end we will all attain Oneness through Gnosis of God\u2019s Son, becoming fully initiated human beings, equal to nothing less than the pleroma [fullness] of Christ. [Ephesians 4:13 as rendered in Jesus and the Lost Goddess at 149))</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In Ephesians 4:25, Paul writes \u201c[w]e are all parts of one body and members one of another.\u201d In Colossians 1:25-28, Paul writes that his purpose in life is to reveal to us the Mystery that was hidden in past ages--namely, that Christ (i.e., the logos) is in us! In Galations 1:15, Paul writes that \u201cGod revealed his Son in me\u201d [emphasis added]. Demonstrating that he had come to identify completely with this higher consciousness within him, and ceased identifying with his ego, Paul states, \u201c[I]t is no longer I [i.e., my ego or \"flesh\"] who live, but Christ [the logos] lives in me; and the life I now live in this body I live by faith\u2014by reliance on and complete trust in the Son of God\u2026.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>As we have previously noted, Jesus offers the same teachings, most explicitly in the Gospel of John (17:19-26). There, Jesus prays that his followers will come to know their true nature. He prays that they will be \u201csanctified by the Truth\u201d so that they:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>all may be One--just as You, Father, are in Me and I in you, they also may be One in Us. [I] in them and You in Me, in order that they may become One and perfectly united....</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>And nowhere is this pre-Christian, Gnostic teaching of creation emerging from the oneness of God through the facility of the logos (which is then dispersed among all peoples) better illustrated than in the opening Chapter of the Gospel of John (v. 1-4):&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>In the beginning was the Logos [i.e., Divine Consciousness, or thoughts of God, confusingly translated as \u201cthe Word\u201d], and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things came into being by Him, and apart from him nothing came into being [i.e., nothing existed prior to God becoming conscious]. In him was the life and that life was the light [i.e., consciousness] of men.</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I could continue with innumerable examples of how misleading translations, warped as they are by the Paradigm of Historicity and doctrine of divine inspiration, have served to obscure similarities between Gnostic and Literalist texts. But the above is hopefully sufficient evidence for now that, properly translated and freed of the Paradigm of Historicity, large parts of the New Testament support, indeed demand, a Gnostic interpretation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>(to be continued in Chapter 5, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/god/@sean-king/reading-the-bible-is-like-picking-out-diamonds-from-dunghills-part-2\">Part 2</a>)</p>\n<h2><br></h2>\n</html>",

All STEEM Dollars for these posts go to the featured author.</strong></strike>\n\n<strike><strong>If you are looking to be featured as an author, please contact me via email - ben.adaptnetwork@gmail.com</strong></strike>\n\n<strong>Edit: From the comments, it seems that this type of author promotion is not the way to go. A 're-steemit' button has been suggested and I think this is a great idea.</strong>\n\n<hr>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6z5In5y.jpg\"/></center>\n\nIf you've played the indie-hit video game <a href=\"http://www.firewatchgame.com/\">FireWatch</a>, by Campo Santo, then chances are that you fell in love with the idea of staying in a fire tower, just as I have.\n\nThe American novelist and poet, Jack Kerouac, famously spent the summer of 1956 manning a fire tower on Washington\u2019s Desolation Peak, in the northern Cascades. Even though he was alone with pencil and paper by design, he didn\u2019t get much writing done. I don\u2019t blame him, the views from the tower are incredible and there\u2019s plenty to fill an adventurer\u2019s time for 63 days.\n\nSo, if the idea of a few days in the sky in a cool-looking fire tower is appealing, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that you can actually rent one of these bad boys.\n\nSince Jack Kerouac\u2019s stay in the 50s, new technologies have made fire lookouts mostly obsolete, some were even torn down. Others were left to rust and splinter, becoming squatter\u2019s dens and canvases for high-altitude graffiti artists. But dozens around the US have survived and are available for rent, evolving into modest sources of revenue for the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s depleted accounts. The Forest Fire Lookout Association maintains a list of available towers; many are available for as little as $20 a night.\n\n<strong>Lets take a look at a few below:</strong>\n\n<h2>1. Black Mountain Lookout, California</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tbHIiBQ.jpg\"/></center>\n\nBlack Mountain Lookout is located on the eastern edge of the Beckwourth Ranger District, 10 miles from Highway 395, near Milford, California.\n\nThe lookout was constructed in 1934 and is a great example of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) architecture. The C-3-type lookout is situated on a single story 10 foot tower and is extremely well-preserved.\n\nThe one-room lookout cabin is set on a tower, rising 10 feet above the ground. It is furnished with two single beds with mattresses, but can accommodate up to four people. There is also space for tent camping adjacent to the lookout, for up to four visitors.\n\n<strong>A closer look in pictures:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NX0S10Y.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HgS38WU.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ULzb0dV.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ljj8y7X.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>2. Hirz Mountain Lookout, California</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6z5In5y.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThis fire tower sits atop Hirz Mountain, California at an elevation of 3,540 feet, offering 360-degree views of Mt. Shasta\u2019s snow-laced peak to the north.\n\nThe McCloud River Wintu tribe held Hirz Mountain in reverence and had a name for it in their own language. But it was a miner, Henry Hirz, who gave the mountain its modern name.\n\nWhen the lookout was built, it was originally a structure that sat on the ground. The mountain was a strategic location for detecting fires because it had a direct view into the headwaters of the McCloud River and most of its tributaries. In 1937, the Forest Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps rebuilt the Hirz Mountain Lookout cabin and included a garage and outhouse. It was one of the last CCC-era lookouts to be built. In 1949, a steel tower was added, constructed of a steel K-brace tower that stands 20 feet above ground level.\n\n<strong>A quick look inside the tower:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uZq8dZ5.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZCHllVy.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>3. Hornet Lookout, Montana</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bD8F1wJ.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe Hornet Lookout is as old school as it gets and features a two-story construction. The ground level provides a living space for two guests and the second story is a small loft used solely for full views of the region. The lookout\u2019s rustic accommodations include a propane cook stove, propane lantern and a small wood stove for heat.\n\nThe lookout provides astounding 360-degree views of the surrounding terrain, including Glacier National Park and Kintla Lake on clear days. Apparently, on some nights, the Northern Lights may be seen from the lookout.\n\n<strong>A 'slightly' more modern look:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fbAMzHn.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>4. Fall Mountain Lookout Cabin, Oregon</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/EyIpkj8.jpg\"/></center>\n\nFall Mountain Lookout Tower is situated about 20 miles from John Day, in central Oregon. It provides 360-degree views of the surrounding Strawberry Mountain Wildness, as well as the towns of Seneca and Mt. Vernon.\n\nThe tower was built in 1933 and sits at an elevation of 5,949 feet. Before satellite surveillance systems, lookout personnel monitored the forest from this 18-foot perch for signs of smoke, alerting fire guards when necessary. Today guests can watch the sun rise and set, spot wildlife from the catwalk and witness dramatic thunderstorms that traverse the territory during summer months.\n\nThe one-room, 14-by-14 cabin sits atop an 18-foot tower and sleeps two. The cabin is furnished with a futon bed and a table and chairs. It has electricity and in the kitchen area, an electric stove and refrigerator.\n\n<strong>Here's a few more snaps:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fVoStKq.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/sUrDl58.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3CrgXdi.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LejQWOZ.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>5. Indian Ridge Lookout, Oregon</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/861cU5N.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe Indian Ridge Lookout sits at an elevation of 5,405 feet in the Willamette National Forest. Indian Ridge was named for the old Indian hunting trail that runs along the summit.\n\nBuilt in 1958, the lookout was used for firefighting by Forest Service personnel until 1973 and is still staffed occasionally during emergencies.\n\n<strong>A closer look inside the tower:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vBd3iLs.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DKt5G2z.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FJePMYG.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ULzb0dV.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>6. Little Guard Lookout, Idaho</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ifhnbPK.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe newest tower on this list, the Little Guard Lookout is located about 9 miles north of Shoshone Camp, was one of the last remaining fire lookouts used in the Coeur d\u2019Alene River area and has only just recently become inactive.\n\nThe structure standing today on Little Guard Peak is the third in a series of lookout buildings that originated back to 1919. In October 1990, Little Guard Lookout was accepted for listing in the National Historic Lookout Register and the first for Idaho.\n\nThe fully furnished two-story fire lookout has dimensions of 14 x 14 feet, an external cat walk, and a gabled roof. It sleeps four guests, but space is tight. The kitchen is on the ground floor and is equipped with a small propane refrigerator, propane cook stove, table, chairs and basic cooking utensils.\n\n<strong>A few more photos:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NXtu1ZE.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/pPy4Dxj.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wuBRx3w.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>7. Spruce Mountain Fire Lookout Tower</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dkazLmP.jpg\"/></center>\n\nPerched atop a forested mountain, Spruce Mountain Fire Lookout Tower offers panoramic views that include Medicine Bow Peak, Rob Roy Reservoir, Jelm Mountain and the southern end of the Snowy Range. After being occupied as a fire lookout, the 55-foot tall structure was renovated and opened to the public for overnight rental in 1977.\n\nThe lookout cabin is furnished with two single beds with mattresses and can accommodate up to four guests. Inside amenities include a table with chairs, cookware, dishes, utensils, cleaning supplies, a propane heater, propane cook stove and oven, propane refrigerator and propane lights.\n\n<em>All photos: courtesy <a href=\"http://www.recreation.gov/\">Recreation.gov</a></em>\n\n<strong>For more information on renting one of these towers visit <a href=\"http://www.firelookout.org/lookout-rentals.html\">firelookout.org</a>.

The second problem was the creation of very low-grade tobacco that some people refused to accept as payment. The policy ultimately created low tobacco prices for farmers. In 1682, there were riots and the tobacco crops of various farms were destroyed.</p>\n<p>The non-uniformity of a currency (apart from paper) is a not a trivial problem. Throughout history, it has been a significant issue. In colonial Plymouth, Massachusetts, the Wampanoag Tribe\u2019s wampum was made legal tender at the rate of six white beads or three purple beads per penny. Unfortunately, supply of beads was limited. It was hard for prices to rise in the sense that the bead, as an instrumentality, was not divisible.<sup>(1)</sup></p>\n<p>Historically, therefore, the government really needed to take over responsibility for coinage. That created another problem. How does one prevent the government from abusing the privilege by basically destroying the value of the currency by issuance?</p>\n<p>Enter Bitcoin. It is very hard to counterfeit since all Bitcoin in existence are always visible in the Blockchain ledger. Supply of Bitcoin is fixed; it is hardwired in the code. This is a possible revolution in currency design. If nothing else, it is a new asset class.</p>\n<p><em><sup>(1)</sup>Barry Eichengreen, Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System (New York: Oxford University Press, 2011), 9-10</em></p>\n<p>---------------------</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimers:</em></p>\n<p><em>Horizon Kinetics LLC (\u201cHorizon Kinetics\u201d) is the parent holding company to several SEC-registered investment advisors including Horizon Asset Management LLC, Kinetics Asset Management LLC, and Kinetics Advisers, LLC.

It's like being in a Kindergarten class full of 20-30 somethings.\n\nThis younger generation seems to worry more about figuring out how to make themselves into a Gawd, while at the same time arguing over which psychopathic authoritarian they are going to vote for as their supreme leader. They do more thinking about who to vote for to control their lives than they do how they are going to survive on their own for the next 40 years or more.\n\nhttps://s16.postimg.org/dqbzdofj9/OK_dees_1_Copy.jpg \n\nWhich one of these \"leaders\" (and I must quote that) is going to do more for me, seems to be the biggest question of younger generations. While at the same time they hold onto the belief that everything was created just for them and everyone else is merely a part of them; their own personal sock puppets of pleasure who must reward them when they do something they consider to be worthwhile.\n<br>\n\nhttps://cdn.meme.am/instances/57755618.jpg\n\n# Vaporware Is Skeery\n\nOne of my biggest disappointments in this community came when @stellabelle, the person with the highest reputation on the site, made a post about an announced feature she liked in another decentralized blogging platform that doesn't even exist. \n\n### The horror! \n\nMany were quick to point out that the other platform was \"vaporware\", yet felt so threatened by her post about this \"vaporware\" that they created fictional stories to apparently discredit her. Others jumped on the bandwagon at every chance in the comments section. For what? For pointing out an announced feature in \"vaporware\"? Some even called this apparent \"vaporware\" a \"competitor\"!?\n\nhttps://s11.postimg.org/e5699gp5v/cover_ears.jpg\n\n# [Faith No More](https://youtu.be/3yVI3UgtvwU)\n\nThis says a lot about the faith these people actually have in Steemit. The fact that a piece of  \"vaporware\" can be considered a \"competitor\" to Steemit, along with the fact that these people feel threatened by this \"vaporware\" would make Leon Festinger roll over in his grave; **because he's dead ... just like this generations ability to debate on a topic without their favorite psychology book in front of them to fashion a response from someone else's thoughts.**\n\nWe even have one of the largest whales on Steemit flagging comments that dare mention a non-existent \"competitor\" or anyone saying anything that, in their mind, is considered \"divisive\" to the community. A flag from this person will all but hide a comment from anyone's view without seeking it out at the bottom of the page. \n\nhttps://s15.postimg.org/820q6kvkr/safe_space.jpg\n\n# [In Muh Safe Space](https://youtu.be/sXQkXXBqj_U)\n\n\nSo much for being a place to discuss anything openly. And yet, people here complain about Facebook and Reddit, yet I can mention Facebook all day on Reddit, and vice versa, and never have to worry that my comment will be hidden by a single individual. Even worse, Facebook and Reddit are some of the most censored platforms in existence.\n\n### Put that in your **[hash pipe](https://youtu.be/_9BGLtqqkVI)** and smoke it!\n\nSome here are taking it upon themselves to create a safe space for everyone else, because apparently the competition from these non-existent platforms is so strong we must hide their non-existent features very mention from the fragile masses. Back in my day, there was a saying ... \"competition is good\", but apparently that's no longer the case.\n\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/cal6wr4tt/manstuff.jpg\n\n# [Smells Like Teen Spirit](https://youtu.be/hTWKbfoikeg)\n\nHere on Steemit, it's hard to find anyone that appreciates sports, guns, hunting, cars or anything that my generation considers to be laced with testosterone. Sure I find computer/programming talk interesting, but it's rare these days to find people online that can talk the 4 basic man groups as well. I've found a few, but for the most part they are hiding within the Steemit caves of obscurity.\n\nSteemit advertises that \"original content\" is rewarded, yet anyone that can speak in great detail on any of those 4 basic man groups will rarely, if ever, be rewarded for doing so. There are a few of these well written articles on these topics here on Steemit, but you will be hard pressed to find one earning more than $5. Why Is that? \n\n### I'll tell you why ... because Steemit, for the most part, is lacking testosterone. \n# (\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b\n<br>\n\nhttps://s13.postimg.org/oou4yaqp3/Grinds_my_gears1.jpg\n\n# [What Grinds My Gears](https://youtu.be/Q685Ko2DHDs)\n\nYou know what really grinds my gears? Steemit. **Steemit really grinds my gears.** Why? Because I'm too old for this shit! And for that reason, **this will be my last post on Steemit**. I will be relinquishing my posting key access for this account and leave it to the younger generation of Tuck Fheman's, so they can post happy thoughts about all things Steemit and be rewarded untold fortunes for doing so. I am just holding them back.\n\nI did my best to be a part of this generations next big thing, but generation Steemit is just too namby-pamby for this old codger. \n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/9mkkeg19t/giphy.gif\n</div>\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/bcrfwvml9/mic_drop.gif\n</div>\n\n<br/>",

contemplative mood over the last few days. &nbsp;The main reason for this that I am due to have surgery on my left eye this Thursday (1st September) - sorry for constantly bringing it up and being such a wimp. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The surgery is routine and is in some ways self-inflicted - it is due to a complication with having had laser eye surgery last year to correct my vision. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Had I not had that done I wouldn't be in this position (although) I don't regret it. &nbsp;No procedure is without risk and since this is a second procedure the risk is increased. &nbsp;It is even greater because I am also a type I diabetic (on insulin) which slows healing down and makes complications more likely.</p>\n<p>My eyesight is very important to me particularly due to my artistic hobbies like photography. &nbsp;Luckily my right eye is absolutely fine at the moment.</p>\n<p>Anyway the natural anxiety over this has lead me to be quite introspective and think about life in general. &nbsp;I have been thinking back to some of the the things I have learned and how they might have helped me had I known them when I was younger.</p>\n<p>They are in no particular order. &nbsp;I make no apologies for some of them being quite obvious or even the sort of cheesy advice you would read on a greeting card.</p>\n<p>So here they are in no particular order:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Money and your career are important but not that important</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Serbian-Dinar-and-another-Currency-000082274485_Smalla1ad2.jpg\" width=\"839\" height=\"571\"/></p>\n<p>When I was younger I was (like many kids) convinced that having lots of money would bring happiness. &nbsp;Having the latest Nike Air Jordans and most fashionable clothes, gadgets and the like was a matter of not only pride but vane necessity.</p>\n<p>It was only later that I started to realise that whilst money is a necessity for paying bills and the like it is only a tool. &nbsp;Above a certain level of comfort having more money doesn't really equate to being happier. &nbsp;It just equates to being able to have more \"things\" i.e. possessions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Depending on how you get the money it can also lead to a poverty of the more valuable commodity which is time. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>By similar extension whilst your career should be important it should not be the most important thing in your life. &nbsp;No matter what you do you aren't going to be able to buy yourself more time so don't waste it needlessly going after more money or a better position at work. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is a kind of Faustian pact where you get the worse end of the deal. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Time is the truly important commodity and sharing it with others is one of the most valuable uses of it.</h3>\n<h1><br></h1>\n<h1>Following the herd (or shoal) doesn't doesn't pay off</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_16631433_SMALLec951.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>We are all programmed by society and culture to follow what is \"normal\" and ordinary. &nbsp;This is especially true during those early teen years. &nbsp;Even though we pretend to rebel by picking subcultures like goth, emo, metalhead or whatever this is just a thinly veiled surface level of individuality. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>At it's base it is as conformist as anything else and is merely designed to massage our egos whilst still allowing us to be cocooned within the comfort of our own selected \"tribe\".</p>\n<h3>Truly great people, the kind that change the world don't follow herds or tribes or anything else. &nbsp;They set their own destiny and forge their own path. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>They make the world follow them.</p>\n<p>I know what kind of person I would rather be and it isn't one of the sheep.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Follow your own dreams not those of others</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_76511897_SMALL42a71.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>This is related to the idea of ignoring \"herd mentality\". &nbsp;We often have dreams and expectations placed upon us by our family, friends and teachers. &nbsp;I remember once telling one of my teachers that I wanted to be an artist or a film director and being told:</p>\n<h3>\"You are much too clever to waste your life on something like that. &nbsp;You should be a doctor or a lawyer.\"</h3>\n<p>It may seem like a complement but these kind of sentiments can be just as damaging as more obviously disparaging ones because they psychologically close down certain options in our lives. &nbsp;One can be made to feel that doing what we want would be letting our family, friends and educators down so we push those things aside and just do what is expected of us.</p>\n<p>This ultimately leads to dissatisfaction with our work and our lives. &nbsp;It is much harder to change this in your thirties or later and much easier in practical terms to do it when you are in your teen years and choosing your career. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Paradoxically it seems harder in your teens to say no to the psychological pressure even though it is ultimately your choice.</p>\n<h3>Self confidence in your own ability to know what you truly want early one pays off in the long term. &nbsp;Don't live your life for other people.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>People who agree with you all the time aren't helping you</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Better_an_open_enemy_false_friendb2a45.png\" width=\"794\" height=\"403\"/></p>\n<p>We naturally like to associate with people who have similar views to us and seem agreeable to us. &nbsp;This is part of human nature. &nbsp;Unfortunately what many of us don't realise when we are younger is that a good friend needs to be honest with us. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Someone who is always a \"Yes-man\" can actually encourage us to stagnate and reinforce our negative behaviours. &nbsp;It is simply not healthy and it is dishonest. &nbsp;Your best friends are those who tell you the truth and call you out on your bullshit. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly in your work and acedemic life it is important to listen to conflicting opinions. &nbsp;Just reading material that agrees with what you already think prevents you from evolving both from a personal and an intellectual standpoint. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We can see this in modern internet culture where people focus purely on material that agrees with their political or societal opinions. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Ultimately it leads to greater division, polarisation and entrenchment of attitudes.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>There is no shame in changing your opinion</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/chinese-proverb-on-windmilla2b73.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"560\"/></p>\n<p>To some degree people who have very strong opinions may be respected. &nbsp;It is seen as a sign of confidence. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It could also be a sign of inflexibility and inability to change. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I believe now that life is all about change and evolution. &nbsp;If you stop moving you get left behind. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I was younger I would stubbornly hold on to opinions and beliefs as a matter of pride. &nbsp;There was a certain amount of machismo behind sticking to your opinions and not conceding to those of others. &nbsp;To change them would be seen as some sort of humiliation.</p>\n<p>This is a complete fallacy of course. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>To stick to an opinion merely for the sake of not changing is not only foolish it is positively pathological. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Ultimately it means that you do not progress as a person. &nbsp;I now realise there is no shame in changing your position and admitting that you were wrong. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In many ways it is a lot braver because you are sure to get flack from others who are unable to do the same for \"flip-flopping\".</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Cherish your friends and family because you don't know how long you have with them</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Happy-multigeneration-family-walking-in-the-countryside-000073792689_Small8784a.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>I found this out the hard way in my early twenties. &nbsp;A friend of mine (let's call him John) who I had been with throughout Junior school went to a different college from me. &nbsp;This was in a different area of the country. &nbsp;Though we often made plans to get together they would often follow through for logistical reasons.</p>\n<h3>Over time our conversations and meetings became less and less frequent as \"life\" started to get in the way. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>A few years later when I was home from University and I hadn't heard from him in a while I bumped into a mutual friend.</p>\n<p>Nothing in my life had prepared me for what I heard next. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A year earlier John had been involved in a minor road accident whilst riding his motorbike. &nbsp;He had fallen off as a result and had received what seemed at the time like a minor knock to his head. &nbsp;Feeling fine he had decided that he didn't need to go to hospital. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for him, that minor knock on his head had ruptured a small artery in his meninges, resulting in a slow but progressive increase in intracranial pressure. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>A few hours later he literally dropped dead. &nbsp;He was only 21.</h3>\n<p>I felt so much guilt. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This friend had been so close, like a brother to me. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He had died so suddenly and I hadn't even known. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I had so many regrets - maybe if we had gotten together before his death it could somehow have changed things just enough to prevent this from happening? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I kept having such thoughts and I still have them from time to time.</p>\n<h3>I don't think I have every truly gotten over the trauma of this.</h3>\n<p>You assume that the people you care about and love will always be there just because you can't imagine life without them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fact is life is fragile. &nbsp;Nobody knows how long they have to live.</p>\n<p>Life and death happen all around us all the time. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Appreciate and spend time with loved ones whilst you can because you never know when that time will be up, either for you or for them.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Your parents and grandparents were young too</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Photo-album---photos-of-children-000070298559_Small3feff.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>One of my teachers at school used to say that -</p>\n<h3>\"When you are young you know everything except your own ignorance.\"&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;This is so true. &nbsp;Once we become teenagers we tend to assume we know better than everyone else. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When our parents and grandparents give us valuable advice we tend to ignore it because - what do they know? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We tend to forget that they were once young and had the same kind of hopes and dreams we do. &nbsp;By being further on in their lives and having more experience they can give us a perspective that we lack.</p>\n<p>They are a resource that we ignore at our peril.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Never give up on your hobbies and interests</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/painting-brush53238.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"530\"/></p>\n<p>We all know the saying that \"variety is the spice of life\". &nbsp;We all tend to get pushed for time as we get older and develop more responsibilities. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is very easy to give up on those simple hobbies that gave us so much pleasure when we were younger. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether it was engaging in a particular sport, listening to music, enjoying nature or just travelling we tend to give less importance and priority to these activities.</p>\n<p>These kind of activities are very important for recharging our mental energy and helping us to get away from the worries and concerns of life. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>One could almost consider them to be like a from of activity based meditation.</p>\n<p>I gave up on my art work for many years due to the sheer workload I had during University and then in work. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was a mistake and it was only through being forced to re-enage with it through ill health that I realised how important and fulfilling a part of my life it was and now still is.</p>\n<h1><br></h1>\n<h1>My Final Point: Life is short make sure you actually experience it</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_89191645_SMALL0da25.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>As you get older you start to realise how quickly time passes by. &nbsp;We have a tendency to live in either the past or the future, rarely experiencing the present. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not only does this make time appear to pass more quickly but it also leaves us unable to appreciate what we have at the time only realising it later through the lens of hindsight. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the principles of mindfulness is the idea of recapturing and experiencing the moment. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think we would all do well to follow this idea. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>By reconnecting with our momentary existence we can become more aware of our own thoughts, feelings and what we ultimately want. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>It can also allow us to readjust our focus on what is important and start to concentrate on it more whilst we still have time. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>So many of us simply drift through our lives without the kind of focus this could provide and you don't want to be the person who starts making these kind of observations when it is too late for you to be doing anything with them.</p>\n<h3>You don't want to end up feeling like you were just a passive bystander or a passenger in your own life.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_57565926_SMALLac7bb.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Thanks very much for reading. &nbsp;I hope you found it useful and interesting.</p>\n<h3>Do you have any

Please share in the comments below.</h3>\n<p>This will probably be my last post for a while as I am due to have eye surgery tomorrow and will be recuperating for some days. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If I have time I might put out another post before the operation but if I don't please all take care and I wish you all the best.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>You can find more of my work by following me @thecryptofiend - thanks.</em></p>\n</html>",

Apparently, we did. The obvious--to most of us--is getting, well, too obvious. &nbsp;Some self-declared scientific types had to review some pictures and all agree (mostly, 76 of 77) that nothing of the sort is happening right in front of us.</p>\n<p>Really now?</p>\n<p>First, the published articles that I recently saw in the news referencing the <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084011/pdf\">published paper</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/science/scientists-just-say-no-to-chemtrails-conspiracy-theory.html?partner=msft_msn&amp;_r=3\">The New York Times:&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Scientists-Just-Say-No-to-1.jpg\" width=\"841\" height=\"902\"/></p>\n<p>Now <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160812103718.htm\">Science Daily:</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chemtrails-not-real-say-atmospheric-science-experts-ScienceDaily-2016-08-24-21-53-51.jpg\" width=\"776\" height=\"989\"/></p>\n<p>A quick excerpt to get us started:</p>\n<p><em>The authors of this study, including Carnegie's Ken Caldeira, conducted a survey of the world's leading atmospheric scientists, who categorically rejected the existence of a secret spraying program. The team's findings, published by Environmental Research Letters, are based on a survey of two groups of experts: atmospheric chemists who specialize in condensation trails and geochemists working on atmospheric deposition of dust and pollution.</em></p>\n<p><em>The survey results show that 76 of the 77 participating scientists said they had not encountered evidence of a secret spraying program, and agree that the alleged evidence cited by the individuals who believe that atmospheric spraying is occurring could be explained through other factors, such as typical airplane contrail formation and poor data sampling.</em></p>\n<p><em>The research team undertook their study in response to the large number of people who claim to believe in a secret spraying program. In a 2011 international survey, nearly 17 percent of respondents said they believed the existence of a secret large-scale atmospheric spraying program to be true or partly true. And in recent years a number of websites have arisen claiming to show evidence of widespread secret chemical spraying, which they say is linked to negative impacts on human health and the environment.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u2026</em></p>\n<p><em>\"The experts we surveyed resoundingly rejected </em><em><strong>contrail photographs</strong></em><em> </em>(emphasis mine)<em> and test results as evidence of a large-scale atmospheric conspiracy.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>---------------------</em></p>\n<p>Did you get that? \"Photographs\", that\u2019s (almost) all they looked at, studied or examined; that\u2019s it! Just some static pictures. In my \u201cscientific research\u201d I went a step further. How could I not? My job, my reputation, my incumbent responsibility to my employer and nightly audience was at stake. Instead of examining photographs, which I already had thousands of, I bought four cameras, two computers, and some time lapse software so that I could watch the entire day\u2019s weather happenings in under five minutes. These cameras would begin recording the sky, snapping a picture every five-seconds from sunup and finish at dark, day after day after day. Pictures were not good enough for me. I needed video just to see if there was something that I was missing!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I would get home from doing the 10pm news, change my clothes, and go upstairs to begin rendering the four movies. I had one camera covering each of the cardinal directions and then watch each one.&nbsp;It is truly amazing what we don't see when we watch clouds without the aid of compressing time by 150 times or 300 times. At these speeds, it all makes sense. To be able to see all different layers of the atmosphere working together, or against each other, a fog that seems like and even feels calm, but is actually violently whipping around, even clouds&nbsp;retaining their shapes and sizes as they pass through each other, WTF!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/Yi4YFzyeEZ0</p>\n<p>What is quickly understood is that the wind does not carry the clouds, the water molecule is riding upon another force, another current, apart from the wind. This was a revelation to me and once realized by the wider atmospheric sciences community will utterly revolutionize the science. I lost count of the times I would see a cloud layer moving EXACTLY 90 or 180 degrees opposed to the layer immediately above or below. This is impossible in a natural setting.&nbsp;Now reflect on how many chemtrails you seen in the shape of a perfect \"T\" or \"X\". Think of alignments...&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An excerpt of me discussing when I started recording the sky with time lapse.</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/LXsPhe9zWoA?t=8m18s</p>\n<p>I began this operation in January of 2005, just slightly more than six months after having my <a href=\"https://steemit.com/geo-engineering/@scott.stevens/wouldn-t-it-or-would-it-be-great-if-we-could-control-the-weather\">\u201cAh-ha\u201d moment</a>; in which I came to understand that all the planet\u2019s weather was profoundly impacted by man-made technology. Still, I had questions of where did all these planes, trails, and conspiracy fit into this complex story? It wasn\u2019t until I was four months into this project that I finally got my answer. Only then did I understand that these planes were tracing out geometric patterns while isolating perturbations, distortions, or gaps in already existing trails. It was freaking \u201cBrilliant!\u201d, was my exclamation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These revealed perturbations ARE the reason for the chemtrails!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/sunset_arrowed.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"358\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_0012.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\"/></p>\n<p>Watch an example in this narrated video of the planes unique flight patterns recorded by during those early days of my research.</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/WVhbdhT9xoY</p>\n<p>How else would the weather makers know where to target, how much energy to target and the results of their work, without these straight chalk lines in the sky to gauge their effectiveness? If you\u2019re going to pulse the atmosphere with \u201csomething\u201d you\u2019ve then got to go figure out if you got it right! Was the \"input\" enough, or not enough? Was the intended impact sufficient to achieve the desired result, Yes-or-No?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Straight lines across a moving fluid would allow for the direct observation of the atmospheric intervention and yet still appear to be just contrails to the masses below. It is an utterly elegant program that now with forty years under its belt has remained in the dark recesses of atmospheric sciences. A science that is so obsessed with the illusory CO2 issue that there is no intellectual capacity or energy available to see what\u2019s happening right of front of their faces.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/EL-831-Marion-1976.bmp\" width=\"850\" height=\"526\"/></p>\n<p><strong>A train yard, &nbsp;1976 - Engine EL 831 Marion, Ohio &nbsp;-- Chemtrails already in the sky</strong></p>\n<p>Again, a very well played hand guys. Aircraft, in plain sight, some trails, but not too many, usually\u2026 Then get the program to use commercial aircraft (the most economical solution available versus military transport types) to do the work so it blends in with everything else up there, and then share the wealth that results from the program. The Military Industrial Complex makes a mint with all the planes, satellites, computers and esoteric technology perfected upon deployment. Those in the \u201cknow\u201d get to play in the energy, food &amp; agricultural, insurance, re-insurance and commodities futures markets making billion upon billions of dollars with foreknowledge of what is to come weather and climate wise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>War, weather warfare is a racket and the population is told that we are experiencing \u201cclimate change\u201d when&nbsp;really it is \u201ceco-terrorism\u201d as Former Defense Secretary William Cohen termed these activities back in 1996, some twenty years ago!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_S._Cohen\">The full quote:</a><em> \"...some scientists in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific so that they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races; and others are designing some sort of engineering, some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops. Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.</em></p>\n<p><em>So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations. It's real, and that's the reason why we have to intensify our efforts, and that's why this is so important.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cohen3.gif\" width=\"165\" height=\"169\"/></p>\n<p>Another point to consider: With GLOBAL geoengineering now four decades active what is the true trend-line of the planet\u2019s surface temperature? I contend that this number has been totally lost and smeared by these activities. No one outside of those involved specifically with these activities knows the true state of Planet Earth\u2019s climate. It has been hijacked.. for some reason that is apparently worthy of this massive, expensive and covert operation.</p>\n<p>What we need is an Edward Snowden to emerge from the geoengineering programs to come forward and share the truth with humanity so we can make intelligent, informed and sane decisions about what to do to prepare for the coming decades. Is it an Ice Age as the <a href=\"https://astronomynow.com/2015/07/17/diminishing-solar-activity-may-bring-new-ice-age-by-2030/\">Sun is screaming</a> or is it a middling along like the past 20 years with little change in the surface temperatures or a resumption of the warming like we experienced during the first half of the 20th Century?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Which is it?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/article-2055191-0e974b4300000578-216_468x4731.jpg\" width=\"468\" height=\"473\"/></p>\n<p>We deserve to know, sooner than later.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gisp-last-10000-new.png\" width=\"829\" height=\"493\"/></p>\n<p>This global weather and climate engineering program WILL END. My question becomes, \"What happens then?\" &nbsp;This issue is the most important one facing all of us today. Not tomorrow or next year, but today.</p>\n<p>Keep looking up,</p>\n<p>@scott.stevens</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weatherwars.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trail-finger.jpg\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "Trading Steem is not hard. In that part steem(it) development team has done a great job. Compared to the establishment Steem is a huge step in the right direction of fairness and openness.\n# How the JS index works\nJS measures the net result of the buyers and sellers actions.\nEveryone buying Steem (or anything else) in any financial instruments market does it to profit. Interesting distinction is however if those buyers or seller do expect their profits short term or long term.\n\n## How short term Steem \u201cspeculators\u201d act?\nThey buy steem and expect return in a matter of days, weeks, months.\n## How long term Steem \u201cinvestors\u201d act?\nThey buy steem and expect return in a matter of years. They buy steem, and in this particular high devaluation environment that Steem is quickly power up .\n\nMeasuring the net result from the Steem \u201cspeculators\u201d and  Steem \u201cinvestors\u201d buying, compared to Steem owners selling can give us the ultimate tool to measure the future price movement of Steem (in  the short to medium term).\n\n# And it turns out to be incredible easy\nAll of the described above is nothing more than the \u2026 increase/decrease of the total Steem held by exchanges! (with a few caveats I will keep  proprietary for now)\n\n# How this matters\u2026 give me a practice example.\nOK here it is.\nSteem hit a local low of 0.001224 btc/steem on 08/29 4:30 UTC. Since then the price is generally higher. Should you buy (out of FOMO) or wait for the price to come down to even lower levels sometime in the near future.\nIf JS index has fallen down since  08/29 (as it has indeed) this means that all the buying (price increase) was by short time speculators. So, if no news justifie their buying exuberance, you can expect soon those speculative buyers to give up/cash out of their short term position and the price to continue following the long term trend of the JS index itself.\n\n# Initial JS index\nThe index is set at __1000.000__ as for 2016-07-26 12:56:12 UTC\n\n# Current  JS index\nAs of 2016-08-31 03:03 (UTC) the value is: __553.650__\n#\n[EDIT]\nBelow is a chart of JS Index and Steem price for July 27th to Aug 30th NB some days have more than one data point.\n#\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Ukazg7G.png)\n#\n#steemit #trading #finance #steem #money",

If you'd like to participate in the beta, simply send an email to steemapp@gmail.com and which device (iOS or Android) so we can send you a beta invite.  We're utilizing hockeyapp.net (microsoft) to manage the beta. \n\n### Some important things about the beta:\n- *Use at your own risk - **period**.*  \n- Don't login with an account that has your life savings in STEEM. Why? Because this is a beta product!\n- Don't login with your password if you don't feel comfortable - you can still use the app without logging in. Key import options will be available in a future version.\n- Images you upload from your mobile device are publicly available to the world. \n- Image hosting providers could change during the beta and your images could be wiped out permanently without notice\n- We receive crash reports, analytics and other useful debugging information from HockeyApp\n- Once signed up, you will receive notifications to download all future versions of the beta\n- Are there known issues? Yup! Expect frequent beta versions with no announcement.\n- Hockey provides features to send us feedback directly. There's a 100% chance we'll get your feedback if you submit through hockey app or email us steemapp@gmail.com.\n\n# How You Can Help\nWe are developing at a feverishly-fast pace...as fast as two guys can who have day jobs and families to support.  If we could, we'd say adios to the day job and focus 100% on Steemy (that's a dream I have weekly).   That being said, the reality is that we are building this with our own time, energy and spare funds.   That makes us no less passionate or driven, but imposes real-world constraints on development.\n\nYou can help us by:\n1) Participating in the beta\n2) Giving us constructive feedback on crashes, design, and other app-specifics\n3) Of course, financial - any funds we receive via upvoting go directly to supporting our monthly server costs, red bull addiction, etc...\n\n# How to sign up for the beta\n- Email us at steemapp@gmail.com and tell us which device (iOS or Android) you want an invite for\n- Or, if you don't care who sees your email address, post a comment below and specify iOS or Android (or both)\n\n# What is Steemy?\n\n[Learn more about Steemy Here](https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemapp/introducing-steemy-fully-native-ios-android-apps-for-steem)",

    "body": "<html>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Continuing on from the previous tutorial style I though it would be useful to cover how an image evolves from the original RAW file to final finished and corrected file.</p>\n<h1>TLDR: The Finished Image VS the Original Side by Side</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Arif_Akhtar_Gabby_EOAI_01_final_desaturate_crop1of1copy_small35b3a.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"525\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Arif_Akhtar_Gabby_EOAI_01_original1of1copy_small65a05.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"525\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Final image is on the left and the original image is on the right. &nbsp;You can also see a large version of the final image at the bottom of the post.</p>\n<p>The original image is already pretty good and only needs very minor corrections for blemishes, colour balance etc. - using the right kind of lighting and lenses helps with this - as well as the model having good skin and makeup. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The equipment used was my Nikon D800 camera with Nikon 85mm/1.8 lens shooting wide open.</p>\n<p>The model here is Gabriella Kennedy. She was backlit using the window behind her and a reflector held in front for front lighting and highlights in the eyes.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Basic Skin Retouching in LR and Photoshop</h1>\n<p>I have used the spot removal tool in Lightroom to remove some minor blemishes which leaves me with the image below. &nbsp;I have described use of this in more detail in my <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@thecryptofiend/quick-portrait-retouching-in-lightroom-tutorial\">previous tutorial</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.05.02c2a5b.png\" width=\"403\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>Basic skin retouching to remove blemishes in Photoshop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.05.13d51a2.png\" width=\"604\" height=\"494\"/></p>\n<p>Larger version to show this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.05.31730aa.png\" width=\"415\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>The difference is subtle but I don't want to go too far and remove too much skin detail. &nbsp;I'm just using the spot healing brush tool as detailed in <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@thecryptofiend/how-to-fix-damaged-photos-in-photoshop-tutorial-with-example-image\">my previous photo repair tutorial</a>. &nbsp;This photo is already pretty blemish free so doesn't need anything more advanced.</p>\n<h1>Temperature Adjustment</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.05.4780851.png\" width=\"627\" height=\"510\"/></p>\n<p>Detail to show the difference. &nbsp;The colour seems off. &nbsp;So I'm going to do a colour balance adjustment here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3017.34.34ee0e5.png\" width=\"658\" height=\"592\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.06.448f1bc.png\" width=\"402\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This is an improvement but it's not perfect. &nbsp;I might do more fine adjustment in Lightroom. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Background Fix</h1>\n<p>I also want to remove the window bar behind her. &nbsp;So on new layer (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N). &nbsp;I use the clone stamp tool to copy the background to the right over to bar. &nbsp;The clone stamp tool looks exactly like a stamp and is just below the healing brush. &nbsp;It directly clones an area without any intelligent modifications.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.06.580da7b.png\" width=\"404\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>So the bar is now gone.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Eye Veins</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.07.2447c66.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"582\"/></p>\n<p>OK I might do some very subtle work on the eye veins. &nbsp;Again I will create a new layer (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N) and zoom in and carefully use the healing brush to erase the veins.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.09.1331e69.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"412\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.12.32785f6.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"591\"/></p>\n<p>This is to show the difference to one of the eyes. &nbsp;This is a bit too much so I will enlarge the image and reduce the opacity of this layer to 50%.</p>\n<p>Here is the full size image. &nbsp;This looks about right.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.26.1667b29.png\" width=\"402\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Final Adjustments in Lightroom</h1>\n<p>I'll save this and open it up in Lightroom for final adjustments. Just before saving I couldn't resist doing another colour balance change but it is really unnecessary as I will fix the colours in Lightroom.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3016.40.26ef4e2.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Screenshot2016-08-3017.44.2804107.png\" width=\"249\" height=\"598\"/></p>\n<p>I have basically adjusted the exposure very slightly to +0.10 -</p>\n<p>I have also tried auto temperature which gave a more balanced result but the colours didn't look right to me. &nbsp;It set the Blue/Yellow slider to +13, so as a compromise I set it half way to +6 which looked better to my eye.</p>\n<p>I also reduced the saturation by -11 as it seemed a bit strong to me. &nbsp;The image is essentially finished apart from cropping.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Final Image With and Without Cropping</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Arif_Akhtar_Gabby_EOAI_01_final_desaturate1of1a10fd.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1199\"/></p>\n<p>Uncropped</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/30/Arif_Akhtar_Gabby_EOAI_01_final_desaturate_crop1of16fa86.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1199\"/></p>\n<p>Cropped. &nbsp;The difference is very subtle but I think the crop emphasises the eyes and face more.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>THE END</h1>\n<p>I hope you found this useful. &nbsp;I've tried to keep it short and to the point.</p>\n<p><em>You can see more of my work @thecryptofiend - hope you enjoy.</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>(Verification for me here: </em><a href=\"http://www.aapicture.com/about-me\"><em>http://www.aapicture.com/about-me</em></a><em>)</em></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "![jumpingpeoplesteemitanarchyfaba6.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/jumpingpeoplesteemitanarchyfaba6.jpg)\n\nFor many of us, Steemit has already changed so much - the way we navigate the web, the way we think about money, and for a fortunate committed few, it's even changed their professions. However, the change that I expect from this model goes even deeper. It's possible that Steemit, and descendent technologies, may play a part in creating a voluntary world, a stateless world, in which everyone who takes money from someone, or puts someone in a cage without their consent, or orders such acts, will be seen and treated as a criminal. There are several ways in which Steemit can aid this cause. Let's start with the most important - the conversation.\n\n# It changes the way we talk\n![argument288ba5.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/argument288ba5.jpg)\n## The problem with voluntaryist argumentation\nMany of you might have noticed, and even been a party to, hard-line conversations about anarchy, in which the voluntaryist proceeds to take the words of the other party, and question them about some perceived inconsistency in their beliefs, attempting to lead them through a Socratic dialogue, in order to bring them to accept the truth - that the other party is wrong - very, very wrong. You also might have noticed (as I eventually noticed, after years of banging my head on walls) that this technique almost never works.\n\nOf course, the reason that it doesn't work, is because people have a need to feel that they're being understood, that their concerns are heard, that their thoughts are valid. In brief, they need to feel like people. If you don't treat someone like a person - unless you're talking to an exceptionally patient person - you're unlikely to receive a personable response.\n## An oasis\nThe comment section on YouTube is a running joke. Facebook discussions descend into dirtslinging, strawmen and threats. You may wade through many racist and sexist comments before you find something that is truly valuable information, and even then it may be tainted with aggression. In contrast, Steemit's comments sections seem like a desert oasis - all but filled with calm discussion, respect, insight, or at the very least, positivity. Surely, this is a place where one can have a constructive conversation about controversial topics.\n## The incentive to be good\nI have noticed over these few short months, the way that Steemit has changed the way that I interact with people, especially online - on Steemit and other social networks. I've found myself a few times, even as I'm about to make a statement which is mildly passive-aggressive, thinking \"Hold on - is this something I would write if my reputation were on the line? If not, maybe I shouldn't write it.\" Even when I'm going to give someone some piercing criticism, which, if presented in the wrong way, may seem a condemnation, I can find ways to demonstrate empathy, such as compliments or other niceties.\n\nIt may sound like an unfortunate description of humanity (or of myself) to say it, but when our bank balances and reputations are on the line in every moment, we can find ways to communicate more kindly, and therefore, more fluidly, with the people we interact with.\n## Commitment and consistency\nIn Cialdini's famous and excellent book, [Influence: The psychology of persuasion](http://amzn.to/2c5z38T) he describes how, when people make a commitment to something, they are more likely to see it as part of their identity, and strive to live up to that identity.\n\nWhen people are kind to each other, respectful, and even open-minded on Steemit, it's not just that they're pretending to be nice. By acting nicer, they become nicer. By acting more open-minded, they become more open-minded.\n## The quality of our ideas\nIf the ideas of voluntaryism are as good as we believe they are, then surely a place like Steemit, where people are strongly encouraged to be respectful, considerate, empathetic and even open-minded, would be an ideal place to discuss them. If it turns out that our ideas are not as good as we think they are, then it gives us the perfect medium to discover something even better. That is beautiful.\n# Tax-free and shameless\n![breakchains10ab9.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/breakchains10ab9.png)\nIn many developed countries, taxes are generally seen as legitimate and necessary, and people claim to be proud of paying their taxes - sometimes because they truly believe it, and sometimes because they don't want to face the fact that they have been forced into an elaborate con, from which they have no apparent escape.\u007f\n\nBut what if they did have an escape? What if, instead of being paid as an employee, having their income taxes automatically deducted from their pay, they were paid directly. What if thousands or millions of people were making income, or making a living, this way, and decided to openly flout the tax authority, publicly, knowing that it wouldn't have the resources to pursue any more than a small fraction of the cases?\n\nObviously, that would damage the appearance of legitimacy of the state, and also the perception of omniscience and omnipotence that its proponents tend to ascribe to it.\n# Development of cryptoanarchic solutions\n>\"Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word 'anarchy', in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It\u2019s a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.\"\n> - Wei Dai\n\nWe all know that Steemit/Steem is much more accessible than virtually any other cryptocurrency, being based around a style of platform which more than one billion people are already familiar with. That's pretty cool, and that means that more money will flow into cryptocurrency, meaning more attention, and thus even more development for similar technologies.\n\nMore development in cryptocurrency means more methods to control money, and other forms of information, publicly, privately, or anonymously, without governments being able to do anything about it.\n# Conclusion\nSteemit is an important step, a continuation of the snowball effect of cryptocurrency, leading us to a voluntary, cryptoanarchic future, full of wonders we have not yet imagined, and degrees of freedom as yet unforeseeable. Boldly we take our pens, pads, keyboards and wallets, building a highway to a world where concepts are our language and our tools, but never our weapons, where the purity of ideas is worth fighting for, but never worth fighting with.\n\n---\n\n# About me\n\n[![kurt robinson in the mountains of puebla](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/26/pictureofmecroppedbdb8d.md.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/gsqzK)\n\nMy name is Kurt Robinson.

Professional knowledge, in particular technical know-how, is a key asset for such organizations as their success depends to a large extent on their ability to create, manage and transfer knowledge efficiently. Let us call this process <strong>knowledge valorisation.</strong> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I review below some of the key enablers of knowledge valorisation&nbsp;by sketching a sort of road map.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Step 1</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;The first step shown below&nbsp;might look trivial, but I believe that most organizations (in particular those which are in the process of restructuring, M&amp;A, etc)&nbsp;might find it worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/ueoc9n77j/road.png\" width=\"959\" height=\"545\"/></p>\n<p>In other words,&nbsp;the first challenge is to make sure that knowledge is properly tracked and stored, especially if the organization is very large.&nbsp; If knowledge turns out to be mostly in <strong>implicit</strong> form, the organization runs a significant risk to lose knowledge and performance as a result of staff turnover, as when the key people leave or retire, nobody may be able to run some critical processes. In addition, as implicit knowledge is difficult to share, if explicit knowledge on key processes is not available, it is difficult for new recruits to become quickly operational. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>If a large body of documents spanning the organizational knowledge landscape is available in electronic format, it is appropriate to set up and use a formal knowledge classification scheme. The most powerful approach to knowledge classification, following the principles of semantics, is based on two components: &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Taxonomies</strong>, i.e. multi-level, tree-like classification frameworks. An example of a comprehensive, well-known taxonomy is Linnaeus\u2019 classification scheme for nature as divided into three kingdoms: mineral, vegetable and animal. Linnaeus used five levels: class, order, genus, species, and variety.&nbsp;Advanced knowledge management might call for the definition of multiple taxonomies, as shown in the example below. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Classification rules</strong>, i.e. a set of criteria to place each document in one (or more) positions in the taxonomy. Rules are typically based on specific properties of the document. Simple classification rules are based on keywords and other metadata, e.g. if a document has \u201cJava\u201d as a keyword, it is likely to be classified under a \u201ccomputer science\u201d branch of a technological taxonomy. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above elements, taken as a whole constitute an <strong>ontology</strong>, i.e. a detailed, potentially exhaustive description of a knowledge domain in terms of a collection of data records, together with their metadata/attributes, organized and classified in one or more taxonomy-based \u201ccatalogues\u201d. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/jbvf5lv93/semantics.png\" width=\"1006\" height=\"522\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The pictures above refer to&nbsp;an ontology which is relevant to a public research organization which regards technology transfer as part of its mission.&nbsp;Such organizations feel strong pressure by their funding bodies to demonstrate the positive socio-economic impact of public research on society through concrete examples. In order to meet such demands, they must define and implement a proactive and cost-effective Knowledge &amp; Technology Transfer (KTT) strategy. Then it is essential that all the knowledge assets in the organization are identified (technologies, general know-how, training capabilities) and as many KTT channels (licensing of intellectual property, joint R&amp;D with industry, training, people mobility \u2026) as possible are enabled. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>At this point, a classification engine is used:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/fk988pp6j/classify.png\" width=\"971\" height=\"558\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The ultimate deliverable is a context-sensitive, searchable knowledge catalogue&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/w8zb4dy35/catalogue.png\" width=\"1065\" height=\"616\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Informal Summary</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>All the tools described above aim at avoiding that in a large organization people reinvent the wheel all the time, just out of lack of knowledge of what their colleagues are working/have worked on. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, using the wheel analogy: if you are into technology transfer, such tools will help&nbsp;you show your \"wheel\" outside your organization and identify whoever could use it to make an innovative car!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note that some older comments to this post refer to (very different) content which has now been removed.

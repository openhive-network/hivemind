    "body": "Money Money Money ahhhh HAAAH ahhhh ha haaaaaaa all the things I would do.... if I-\nI always wondered about the charismatic Ken O\u00b4Keefe. \n*Is this what controlled opposition looks like?*\n\nhttp://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/media/blogs/blog/29/okeefe-c29.jpg\n\nI took my chances and admired him for his truly heartfelt passionate work.\nThere are *fuck all* strong male role models willing to prick the beast and speak truth to power. \nKen was a welcome swearing voice in the wilderness of white apathy.\n\nSadly his latest project has been derailed in under three months\nDespite how much good he has done, how many people he has helped, something is happening to his work now.\nKen is looking like a liability.\nWill he just facepalm in a years time and just blame it all on luurve\n\nHe is a walking cliche of the two-headed man this year.\n\nMax Igan certainly spells out *what the whole lot of us* might unwittingly have accomplished... even if he *is* just a tad dramatic \n-that this will put an end to *all* fundraisers\n-bring an end to *all* trust \n-an end to any voice that *put their name * to the project\n-effectively put an end to any co-ordinated response to the system.\n\nMax, Its just Ken.  \nIts not armageddon\n\nIs *that* what we __all__ have been __participating in *wittingly and unwittingly*__?\n\nI swear I will never fucking learn!\nIs *__that__ why Dodgy Deanna recruited __me,__ right at the 11th hour...?*\nWas there some chance some of them *knew right from the start this shit was already on its way down the toilet*, either to go off its own rails or be derailed?\n\nAm I becoming *effective*?\n\nPooh for thought\n\nI\u00b4m sorry to my friends and anyone who has donated time or money to the World Citizen Solutions oxymoron.\nI am sorry I endorsed the \"project\". \n\nIm sorry Im alive some days but Im doing my best.\nAs Grandma says \"DOUBT MEANS DONT\" and I wish I listened to my gut.\n\n\nHere are the lessons\n-No one can change the world we can only change ourselves.\n-Donating money to a cause does not excuse you from doing the personal work required to be sovereign and higher than government. This is only your natural state if you know it and self educate to lovingly reclaim it.\n\nRedeem your soul. Rescind your *walking dead* status and come alive again as the flesh, and not the corporation.\nI *know* a \"citizen\" *can not be* sovereign.\nI *know* how not to pay tax, I escaped civilisation and lived in a tent for years so I could study contract law.\nI *know* only self-realised sovereign beings can exist \"outside of government\" with large effort, sustained courage and usually requires physical relocation and or jail time. \nFor me that effort is worth it to no longer be obligated to pay taxes to the warmongering Australian government that claims it owns me. It is very hard to learn financial independence in a foreign country but its easier for me to do that than bomb someones lovely kids in Syria.\ni *know* sovereign beings dont use lawyers. To use a lawyer is to declare yourself incompetent.\nYou go *by special appearance* if you are mad enough to go at all. If you are not unconscious or being dragged in handcuffs.\n\nI have also come to appreciate the power of *sealed and notarised affadavits* declaring sovereignty, *combined* with a UCC1-308 __*will*__ disqualify the states jurisdiction over your flesh in breaches of acts statutes and regulations when there is no harmed or injured parties.\nSorry for that boring sentence.\n\nI didnt feel the need to *financially* support this mission of Ken O\u00b4Keefe. \u00b0\u00b0\nNor did I feel the need to correct him on these glaring inconsistencies in his original plan, *(or the globe earth in the promo ; )* because\n1-i assume hes busy\n2-takes years of self education to realise these things\n3-I am no authority  \nKen knows me as a mad lady who lived in a van made of weed\n\n\u00b0\u00b0I am still burned from that experience with Ken two years ago watching David Ickes manager Sean Adl-Tabatabai and his assistant Deanna Amato bleeding the UK and Europe dry for all their goodwill donations to THE PEOPLES VOICE channel.\nOnce I saw through that ruse I I estimated *most*, maybe (70%) of the people working there were compromised agents. They were all connected like worker bees but seemed independent at first.\nThat was 2 million pounds they siphoned, from a loving gullible public thinking if they throw $20 or $1000 at this darn \"slavery problem\" it will go away..\n\nI did enormously enjoy many off the off the cuff speeches Ken has made over the years, so, when asked to support this money gathering mission with a small endorsement I simply sent this, declaring my position.\n\n__*We Need to stop.\nWe need to change.\nWe need to govern ourselves by our consciences.\nWe need voluntary societies based on the non aggressive principle\nThat is human rights. \nThat is freedom.*__\n\n I got more of an inkling that something was up soon after sending my endorsement when I got a thankyou letter from *Deanna Amato*. \nI didnt know Ken was working with her again. I lost trust in her last time.\nI wrote to Ken and told him my concerns.\n\nA few facebook friends told me they had donated, probably, five thousand dollars combined.\nOne was a littled piqued when I offhandedly told him, I hope you get your moneys worth... \n\nNot that I doubted Kens financial integrity at this stage but I am very aware how legal sharks work, how legal \"experts\" by definition can not even *comprehend* sovereignty as they have that BAR so far in their arses theyre crosseyed. \nI just knew Ken could blow that $150 grand on dumbarse legal experts that could teach him nothing.\nOffer him nothing but receipts. \nLike everyone donating their $5 looking for the magic paper, Ken was going to be donating all the little donations straight back UP to our masters in great chunk collections of dosh hoping to buy this __golden ticket__ off *some lawyer friend*, that can free us all.\n\nI have been watching for months a man and his ego.\nI left him to his de-vices, hoping that he will pull this gravy train up before it spills. \nI dont think he has much more pride to lose in a crash so he\u00b4s driving rather recklessly. That is his right.\nIf we are mad at him, we should also be mad at ourselves for not doing more, for not being more of the strength and good we saw in him.\n\nThe more I read of Kens recent \"Subversion report\" about his team, the more I realise it *really* aint looking good.\n\nI have only had a day to look at this. It is not impossible that Max, and all his team are agents sent to compromise Ken and make him look incompetent and, as if he is stealing. \nStranger things have happened. \nBut Max aint trying to buy land in Dominica. So we need to make sure if Ken really *is*.\nKen needs to admit it if he is trying to sink those donations into land. \n\nIf he is the tool of someone else, boy, they really enjoy  watching him flounder\n\nKen told us all back in Dec 2015 that he had \"the worlds leading human rights attorneys\" working on a way to write a contract that could extradite us from government financial demands when the government is committing war crimes.\nI personally dont feel a need for this contract as even when living in Aus I learned to become self employed, un-employed, work for cash...do *anything*  so I could protest this thievery by not having it automatically taken out of a paycheck of a bigger corporation, or government salary. \n\nI know too much. \nI refused to pay all fines tolls and taxes for decades in Australia after I woke up to the trickle UP money scam of all government, and *how easy it is to simply __never receive__ offers to contract, from your government* by __scrawling RETURN TO SENDER - NOT AT THIS ADDRESS__  on the front and __returning__ every and all boring correspondances they send. There is no old nanny sitting at a desk judging you for not opening your contract. Its just logged into a computer somewhere that you never received it.\nSneakily, the fuckers, regard all their contracts as tacitly accepted if you do nothing and just throw them in the bin.\nYou must always RETURN TO SENDER. Make the buggers work!\nWhy?\n\nBecause I know every man is only my equal.\nBecause I have inner strength and Id rather die on my feet than live on my knees.\nBecause so far, money has not compromised my principles\n\nBy Feb 2016 Ken had no observable progress on the legal work and it was getting embarrassing for members on the team being asked by supporters where their money had gone and for what purpose.\n\nKen then (uh oh) \"fell in love\" at Anarchapulco  with a girl \"who was paid to come by the organiser,\" said Max... but not to *perform*, (as such ; )\nShe has achieved a public reputation for targeting alternative media types, derailing two so far...\nIts no crime to get around but when you leave destruction in your wake, three times, people may start to think you jinxed them.\n\nKen joked she may be a \"honeypot\" to steer him off mission. I dont think hes as efficient as *he* thinks.\nI think anyone could pretty much seduce anyone after they broke out of ten years of monogamy. \n\nI do not know what a woman could do to deserve the public embarrassment Ken has dished his ex wife this year.\nWhy is Ken so disrespectful to the mother of his two boys, allowing himself to be so spastically bedazzled?\nIts like a midlife crisis red sportscar fantasy. This is not the guy most people were impressed enough to donate dollars to.\nI often wondered as I researched him before interviewing him, \"once a marine, always a marine?\".\nI consoled myself thinking Ken was doing too much in his personal life challenging Israel and the Fed to be controlled by them\nRight now I\u00b4m 50/50.\nKen might be being handled by someone, or a honeypot, or, *through* a honeypot, or seriously, drop all the paranoia it really could just be a middle aged guy on his last hurrah with his neo Yoko Ono\nI am personally terrified by people who dont think of the fallout of their actions in love. \nLove is life and death stuff. \n\nI dont trust *anyone* in this. Perhaps theyre *all working* for the same team as they explode into splinters. Perhaps I even was, calling for people to help his mission. Ugh I hate how naiive I am. Fucking Pollyanna\n\nPerhaps some knew. Perhaps Ken. Perhaps Sophie. Perhaps Max, perhaps Deanna. Most wouldnt need to know, the handlers know how to make everyone flee in fear once you suspect someone you love and trust is a massive liar running a scam.\n\nReading over both Ken and Maxs statements both contain holes in their logic and research.\nKen remarks \"its silly to think a legally viable UCC contract could achieve anything other than perhaps some temporary defence against the system\"\nand this about Max -\"I felt like I was dealing with a child incapable of understanding a most basic concept - distracting madness\"\n\nMy experience and research suggests the UCC international contract is *__exactly__* the paperwork required  to declare oneself outside of any government jurisdiction. Its an option available to any and all who educate ourselves. It may take a few years reading and listening to gain back all they have stolen, but no one can learn it for you so you will do it when you decide to free yourself.\n\nKen has not studied the first rule of sovereignty.\nHis lawyer *authorities* work __first__ for The Crown, and maybe later, a bit, for us.\n\nThis is something he either has or will come to understand. Recognising what it would take to educate each individual to excoriate themselves from their governments peacefully is too big a task, he either \n-has months of bookwork ahead sending back thousands of donations,  \n-he can reroute the whole \"project\" for the die hard followers and buy himself more time, \n-or he can buy some land somewhere and just fuck off and hide for a few years.\n\nPeople who want to believe the best will grant him time to try more things... somehow keep going.\n\nThose who have been burnt before dont want to sit quiet and let ourselves be fooled again.\nKen has had $150 thousand in donations for almost a year and has nothing to show for it besides the hotel receipts from his 2 month rebound playdate.\nHe says he will have legal paperwork in days proving his project is getting back on track. \nThe race is on\n\nTo hear through Max that Ken is trying to buy land is a good opportunity for us to challenge him to give the money back, before breaking his word. Most will just kiss their $20 goodbye, and this phenomena of people going bad for money will go on while we are slaves in their system.\nYes.\nThere is a fucking hole in the bucket\n\nTo hear Ken accuse Maxs underlying rationale, as jealousy, is sad. Ken is delirious. You frisky old dogs. Even if its true, its embarrassingly juvenile peacocking by Ken. It really seems like stellar insecurities have been tweaked by someone or something. \nThe problem is Ken, *you have done fuck all for a year since you got the money in your bank -besides free yourself of your family and enjoy a string of hotels with your shortsighted trophy.*\n__On the goodwill of thousands of people.__\n\nKen keeps saying \"nothing has changed in the legal stature of the contract viability so why is everyone abandoning me?\" /subverting the project.\n\nBecause there __*is no project*__, as such, any more.\nAs each of us awaken to your derailment we each need to honor ourselves and challenge you to get back on track or return the money to those who ask, as you said you would from day one, if targets werent met. \nThe target is a one page contract (that can be read in under a minute and comprehended within 10 mins), expressing terms of ones absolute unwillingness to cooperate with war crime.\n\nWe could give you more time, if Max didnt alert us that youre trying to buy land.\nIf this becomes evidential, is provable, we must try to stop you from hurting your future and so many others.\n\nKen says \"critical legal work is underway and soon to be completed.\" \nSince his  *whole team* seems to have __quit__, maybe to redeem his arse he needs to just open up the accounts, show everyone how much money has gone where, how much is left, and be transparent. I wont regain my trust with anything less.\n\nI know we\u00b4re all human and could all lose our minds if we suddenly had a hundred grand and a new love, but this is something bleak. \n\nI am 100% on one thing though. There is a possibility this girl doesnt really love him, that really she loves his accomplishments, things that she can one day achieve for herself. That he is falling for the idol worship is also telling, like a pattern. The \"relationship\" may grow on forever but one thing is for sure ...based on Maxs email release, Ken is trying to weasel about for as long as it takes so that he can buy some land in the non-extraditable Dominica, RIGHT NOW.\n\nIf you made a sizeable donation ASK FOR IT TO BE RETURNED in goodwill. \nKen must be stopped from doing this to himself.\nTo think a man of his intellectual ability could be lulled in to this madness by his penis. \nIts unheard of\nJust joshin ; )\n\nTo think thousands of people are going to be broken hearted and despondant about future endeavours is possibly a  good thing. We will all be forced to do the actual work to free ourselves. Until each and every one stand up to the governments ourselves instead of cowering behind our dodgy uncle having an off year.\n\nTo think that all Ken really got out of this last hurrah after decades of good work, was $150 grand and a groupie. \nI suppose some people would think its a pretty good deal\n\nLife is fucking tragic.",

    "body": "Top 19 witnesses get paid way too much, I feel like I am stating the obvious here and it wouldn\u00b4t really be that important if we weren\u00b4t trying to build a more balanced voting/reward system.\n\nIt\u2019s like we are rowing both ways, on one side we are discussing changes in the code to reduce some big whale\u00b4s influence but on the other the system is giving around 1,370 SP per day to 19 users, yeah that\u00b4s right 1,370 SP per day!, this amount is unreachable even for the most prolific bloggers on Steemit and the gap between witnesses and normal users is growing each day. \n\n![](https://s18.postimg.org/qv4sjw8s9/shutterstock109187921.jpg)\n\nPlease don\u00b4t get me wrong this is not an attack on witnesses, I believe most witnesses are doing a great job, they not only maintain the network they also contribute with countless projects and tools. \n\nSo I am not against top witnesses getting paid, I just don\u00b4t think their SP daily payout is sustainable in the long term. \n\n## Possible Solutions\n\nI see two possible solutions to the problem and they would both be very easy to implement:\n\n1.-  It would be better if witnesses were getting a bigger percentage of liquid Steem, instead of 100% in Steem Power. This would not only reduce their SP daily growth it will also add selling pressure to steem, thus contributing to more people buying large amounts of steem for cheap.\n\n2.- Change the current DPOS system so that at least 38 witnesses were finding consecutive blocks. This would be only a partial solution in my opinion, it will reduce top witnesses payout but it would probably still be too much. It would also help out some backup witnesses that are having a hard time maintaining their nodes which are getting more expensive as the specs needed become more demanding. \n\nIt is weird that I have not read anything about this issue on steemit, maybe I have missed it or maybe it is because nobody wants to write controversial posts. Either way I would like to make it perfectly clear that this **IS NOT AN ATTACK ON WITNESSES OR WHALES**, it is my very humble proposal to improve SP distribution, something that would benefit the whole community.\n\n## I would love to read your thoughts on this matter?",

    "body": "I have two proposals to decrease the amount of influence top witnesses gain each day:\n1) Implement a tier system, in place of the current winner-take-all system:\n   * The top 20 witnesses get a fixed percentage of rounds (let's say 50% to be generous).  The 20th slot no longer rotates among the remaining witnesses, but instead among the top 20.\n   * The top 21-50th witnesses get a smaller percentage, lets say 25% of rounds.  This could be randomly divided among these 30 folks, so each round allocated to them would be divided among 19 of these witnesses.\n   * The remaining 51-100+ witnesses would get the remaining 25% of votes (or it could be divided up even more fine-grained).   The same system would be used where 19 of them will witness when this slot is allocated a round.  \n        * Of course there are top 100 witnesses who don't run active nodes, but a git proposal is in place to address that, by removing them from the witness queue if they've been missing blocks until they update their signing key.\n2) 90% (or some amount adjusted for the exchange value of Steem) of top 19 witness' blocks go unrewarded.  Instead of getting 1300 or however many SP a day, they'd only get 130, and the rest of their blocks would give them 0 monetary reward.  At current prices this would be enough for them to live off of and not have to do any other work than contribute to the Steem platform, but not cause them to overtake all active accounts in terms of vote weight.  As statisticians commonly say: \"there's no such thing as a free lunch\" (TINSTAAFL).",

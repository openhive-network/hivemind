Kashmir him not to come after me, until I make him hugs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/DSCN0477faad0.jpg\" width=\"2758\" height=\"2736\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/keops0029612b.jpg\" width=\"1464\" height=\"1162\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Au-sommet81f7b.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"645\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;A small cup of coffee and I'm up for the day. After my shower, I have to feed the fish pond and two hens, they are waiting for me impatiently for me to release them from their cages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/16e3c4.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"464\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Photo0224b24a.jpg\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;6:15, I start my bag on her arm, my water bottle and my biscuit for lunch. On the road I am alone, few vehicles I meet. Great to run your car on a deserted road. In the winter when it snowed, I am the first to make tracks in the whiteness of the snow grows like cotton wool, sometimes, crazy beyond me and skids, it is an adrenaline rush. In summer the sun rises gives the sky a color of red sweetness, yellow, orange. In autumn, the trees begin to change color, it is a season because I love the beauty of trees is unique.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/d85917d4a45b3d581b5f40d1d7a7504a3bb1e.jpg\" width=\"236\" height=\"234\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Here I come down the street or is my workplace, hospital, regional hospital, the CHR. Vehicles coming after one another because we start at 7am. The staff is found, speak, tells their evening then everyone goes to the same place: the time clock, control object of our hours worked.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/chr841bd.jpg\" width=\"916\" height=\"613\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;In the ladies locker room, it gets held: white jacket with blue and green patterns representing the logo of the institution, blue pants with various pockets which we do not serve!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/DSCN1513-Copiee7a4d.jpg\" width=\"410\" height=\"681\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We arrive in our service, mine is the neurological rehabilitation service: we give up (or so) of people who have a stroke, an accident with neurological trauma, people who have multiple sclerosis or Guillain barred and other chronic diseases whose name is almost unknown.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Capture2bb0b8.jpg\" width=\"539\" height=\"627\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/370086-1f7d83.jpg\" width=\"325\" height=\"300\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Capturec0ccc.jpg\" width=\"589\" height=\"598\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We start our day with a report on each patient last night, we have 20 in service. After beginning the nursing: we make the toilet of the patient who is totally dependent. We get up in the chair. For others, we must educate, continue the actions he has learned with the therapist in the individual care, the patient should regain maximum independence so they can go home and take care only . It's a job that can last from 3 months to 6 months beyond, we can not do anything for them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/souleve-malade-foldyadb08.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Headline in this service is: you come to bed but you leave again walking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sometimes, we fail either because the patient does not want a return to autonomy, or because the patient is too ill. We give the same chance to everyone, rich, poor, alcoholic, drug addict, young or old.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The management of a patient goes from shaving the beard of a man to the presentation on the toilet, the room arrangement the carefully tended beds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Lunch arrived around 8:30 am, few patient is in the dining hall for breakfast, other unfinished eat in bed Logistical assistance serves meals that are different if the patient is diabetic, diet, dieters, old, or in solid supply resumption. You should know that when the patient has had a stroke, a stroke, swallowing is absent, which means that if the patient eats a sandwich, but he swallows the bread goes in the bronchial tubes and not in the stomach, giving a false swallowing, bronchi become infected and it's a disaster. So this patient who made false swallowing should eat while cream consistency and drink thickened liquid. Which is not very good but I admit it must go through these stages in order to re-eat a day normally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Physiotherapists arrive at 9am and leave a 17h, occupational therapists also. There is also a neuropsychologist, a speech therapist and all do work that allows the patient to regain maximum independence, which means that the patient all day is busy. Visitors can come between 14:30 and 19:30.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>After lunch, we continue our work, when all is well, we finish around 10:30 or 11am but sometimes it is noon we are still in the rooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In terms of handling, the entry of the patient, it is usually in bed or in a wheelchair with a right hemiplegia or left, some have forgotten that they had half a disabled body, so it must withstand and no wear and show him how to do with one leg to go from wheelchair to bed and vice versa. Others are completely invalid, they know not move neither arms nor legs, and for those, or we wear them either we lift them with a forklift.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>During dinner, we feed the disabled and we encode our care in the computer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Around 13h, we are a few naps after going on the toilet. Sometimes we have a problem in the pants, oops! When everyone is changed to bed, we have a service change ratio and the time, the hour of the end of our service is lagging. At 14h is the start of the morning shift. For my part, I take a good shower and I take the way home or waiting for my cats and my dog makes me a big party.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We must not believe that the nursing profession is simple, each service is different and you can not compare the care of each other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I hope I have not bothered you with this long text, I wish you a good day to you all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

It's funny how we can get so caught up in work and the business of a crazy life and miss the simply beauty along the way. Sometime you've just got to stop and smell the roses; and while you're there, take a picture!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-3-1024x768-300x225.jpeg\"/></p>\n<p>These aren't roses, I know: they're wild flowers. They don't get the nurture and care that roses do, and yet they are provided for and they bloom into beautiful blossoms in their own time. They have a harder life than others, and that's how we humans are as well. Some of us were well taken care of growing up and were treated like roses, while others were left in the field to grow up alone and without the love and care we should have had. But we are all beautiful in our own ways and if we survive long enough, we will blossom into something spectacular.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_6440-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Colorado mountain rivers</h2>\n<p>When the snow on the tops of the mountains melt, it feed the rushing rivers that carve their way down the mountainside. The climbing is excellent, the whether and the views are truly gorgeous, but something about the rivers rushing through the mountains draws you in. There is a memorization about the brave rivers unafraid of the mountains and simply rushing on by recklessly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_6031-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Mississippi at sunset</h2>\n<p>Sometimes the world just slows down and magic happens. This was one of those times. On the night before my sister's wedding in Tupelo, Mississippi the sky exploded in color. What a calm reassurance before a monumental event: the approval stamp of God upon the sanction of their marriage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_5829-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Hundreds of years old Indian hieroglyphs in Arizona</h2>\n<p>This was an incredible hike in the Arizona mountain ranges to discover a place where the Apache Indians, or perhaps some other tribe had lived hundreds of years ago!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2015-07-13-06-37-59-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Uganda, Africa at twilight, from a moving bus</h2>\n<p>Africa is always an adventure, but in 2015 we took a safari on the northern rim and caught this shot on the way back to the lodge. I love how the beauty of the world is unique in its diversity from place to place, even across the Atlantic.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_7281-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>This is one of my favorite shots. I don't remember where I took it or when, but the colors, the bliss, the peacefulness of this field of flowers was stunning. I'm glad I was able to capture an image of its beauty to remember it by. And to think, all of this beauty was made by God in a second! His power to create a world is amazing and perfect in every way. We get to see His marvelous creation every day!&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Follow me <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@ejaredallen\">@ejaredallen </a>for more pictures and great content!</h2>\n</html>",

All stories depicted here either happened directly to people I knew, or were described to me as &nbsp;a <em>it's-russia-get-used-to-it </em>anecdote.<br>\nYes, I will be talking about corruption and paying people under the table for things but bear in mind that even though it seems like a common practice definitely not all people do that and not all people experience the phenomenon.</p>\n<h3>A ROUTINE POLICE CHECK<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p>It is said that it is extremely wise to keep 2k-5k Rubles (about 28-68 Euro, 30-77 Dollars, 23-58 Pounds) in your registration papers at all times. They tend to disappear when you get your documents back from the officer... If one does not have such loose change, the guy tends to make one's life difficult. \"<em>You were speeding\", \"You didn't stop at the STOP sign\", \"You're light is out\" </em>etc. Driving is another interesting phenomenon in Moscow. You might think that since the metro is so packed, the streets will be empty. On the contrary, but I will not get into that right now as that makes a completely different post... &nbsp;However, what I will tell you is &nbsp;how one of my students passed her driving exam, which leads us to...</p>\n<h3>PAYING TO PASS AN EXAM</h3>\n<p>After her first failed attempt, my student looked at her instructor/examiner and asked: \"Could you please tell me what I did wrong, so I can work on it in the future?\" He stared back at her surprised and announced: \"Well, you didn't pay me extra, what do you expect?!\" At that point even I was shocked - \"So people openly tell you they want money?!\" \"Get used to it Kasia, It's Russia....\"<br>\nNeedless to say, she was forced to pay the second time around and surprise, surprise, she passed....<br>\n<br>\nI taught English in a company. I came one week, and saw that everyone was kind of in a rush and slightly agitated. I asked what the problem was and they said they were waiting for an audit. I remember wishing them good luck... One lady looked at me and smiled \"We paid the guys to look the other way, it will be fine!\" I didn't even bother to comment as I had aleady known there was no point...</p>\n<h3>GETTING INTO A PRIVATE EVENT</h3>\n<p>It was the three of us - my BF, his friend and I. We wanted to do some clubbing and the friend decided we should go to a very trendy bar in the heart of Moscow. He had a loyalty card there and was well known among the bouncers. We didn't really look the part, but a hefty fee paid for each of us (by the friend) was enough to let us in...</p>\n<p>That was a minor party. Let's talk about the big stuff, involving bigger money!<br>\nIf you know someone, who knows someone, who knows someone you might be able to (legally) attend the dress rehearsal of the famous Victory Parade in May (the 9th to be exact). It costs about 10k (137 Euro, 116 Pounds , 153 Dollars) Watch fragments of the video below to see the magnitude of what I am talking about.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The whole thing is long, play with it a little bit. The good stuff starts at about 40 minutes. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4qBu3EvraPWezHbaC7npIQ\">Source</a></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EI3FYynz-Q</p>\n<p>To enter the actual parade however, you need to be a prominent member of the society (e.g. ex-military) or someone famous or filthy rich :)</p>\n<p>The event itself is quite impressive and for soldiers taking part in the march it is an honor among honors. &nbsp;<br>\nWe had the privilege of living 15 minutes on foot from the Red Square so we saw all the preparations and marches right outside our windows (till 11pm at night...)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3OMfOqwX2pQ5BYeql8V1tg4J6VcMzG75pLD-nhsfHw0BYFLEQOQSeVl-sVdEkDwS6VfPco-FukpjwQONwimoOhzzT4GIPDt_VGbJfNDYaltTvEcyOFK5do7PZD1-tjDW0nxKYhUQdxG4yoxX6ZS590fMaveLKSI2Voz579yTME9U8D7UgN7R3ufBrAcq0KV8kA9VqMVxryabh2X_jBiMnP3Uwjj_hrWn3ARzHggZMRuo3G3ORSKDpoqcBA25bRDeWHe7nVT4X58NolQ4yY8HVjzyUr4zDneI8dy_eHnSf0F0FBZ8kn4NQQ3ueVR84tu-Ot64CZb9a1SetmKmupvAxBbuS8z3jBsvCECD8A5jz9qevTOkgHEbV0z2hVteH64gCLg3OI9mRVqw2GWAYwNSUlGGtwCxmwXq3p_j_igwncarIhIF2HX_bV0ACrucmewR6IiIdVfaKKAO9g2ycLbJRr_SBwE9TxBND9ar0R267Grzq5SHywG71h1nxZnXInW-HQ2l1cou8zqdiEUanqkeSbgIunZVNBcEnYYinmF-WZd5y0_Luc8rdDYy0GlKAtAJ4z0-woKDs6d_XKWhiWsYOAW3rWwCe3cJylK_6H7wNO2PlBKL=w1163-h775-no\" width=\"1162\" height=\"775\"/></p>\n<p>PS. I am aware that my portrayal of Moscow might seem bleak and depressing. Believe me, it was not. I;m simply trying to describe the juicy bits, the interesting stuff :) My next post will be more optimistic as I will be talking about sports, parks an recreations &nbsp;:)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;____________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading Part 2 of my memoir.</p>\n<p>Want to find out more about living in Moscow?

Great more great reading for you [on my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr)! Be sure to follow me for awesome daily updates in your feed and leave me comments. I love comments!***\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not that smart when we\u2019re under. We can really only do what we hear them telling us to do.\u201d Jake whispered, calmly as the big guard moved within inches of the wall, snorting. The guard turned, blasted a hole in the ceiling with his gun and charged back into the hall. \n\n*They heard him blasting the door of the next room open.*\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve got this one on a signal blocker and there\u2019s not much time.\u201d \n\nThe girl turned and ran to a corner, where an iron hand rail rose up out of the floor in a curve. She disappeared through the floor and as Jack followed, he found a narrow, spiraling stair that led below. \n\nHe lost his footing and slid down the stairs, narrowly missing the girl. She stood in the room below, with ear to the door that led into the hall.\n\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.org/90derv079/spiral_stair.jpg)\n\n*Jake followed close behind. The girl with the violet eyes opened the door and stepped out into the hall with the awakened Nosher right behind her and Jack bringing up the rear. Jack had no idea what to do next, but the girl seemed to be in her element, and willing to help.*\n\n**Hopefully, she was not leading them into more danger.** \n\nHe followed her past one door, and into the darkened room where they had first started. It was empty, which could only mean one thing. The Noshers who had recently occupied it were upstairs right now with the ugly guard. They were looking for Jack and the others and would soon head back down.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we just get out of here?\u201d Jack said. He stood with his back to the wall and the door opened a crack so that one eye could see down the hall toward the upper stairs.\n\n\u201cNot without these,\u201d the girl walked to where the guard had been and pointed up at the weapons, suspended above. She ran a hand along the doorframe, \u201cIt ought to be along here somewhere.\u201d She said.\n\n**\u201cWhat is?\u201d Jack hissed, shifting as her body pressed against his.** \n\nShe ran her hand along the top of the doorframe. He froze; she smelled good. It had been a long time since a girl had gotten this close to him, junior prom, in fact. He did not have a lot of time for dating with his work schedule. \n\n*To top it off, the smell of burnt fries that clung to him even after an hour in the shower was hardly an aphrodisiac.*\n\nThe girl put one hand on his chest and stood on tiptoe, pressing tight against him. \u201cOh, don\u2019t kid yourself; you just happened to be in my way.\u201d She laughed, scornfully, and pressed a hidden button at the top right corner of the door. Weapons rained down with a crash, and she quickly chose two handguns, handing one to Jack. \n\nShe pressed the button again, and the remaining weapons zipped back up into position. Jack had to grip the gun in his hand firmly to keep it from joining them.\n\n![enter image description here](https://s13.postimg.org/xp1l7jjyv/guns.jpg)\n\n**\u201cElectro magnet,\u201d she said and opened the door, moving out, weapon first.**\n\n\u201cI knew that,\u201d Jack said. He flattened himself against the hallway wall, like a TV detective. The magnet had occurred to him, but in his addled state, he had not really grasped the concept. Mostly he just did not like the idea of her being smarter than he was. \n\n\u201cKeep up\u201d he hissed to Jake, who had managed to grab a revolver.\nThe three moved quickly down the hall and turned toward the front door. The two roaches Jack had seen earlier, peered out from either side. \n\n**They had weapons leveled in his direction.**\n\n*The girl crouched and moved forward as if she were still a Nosher. It worked. Jack followed suit, and Jake did his best. His human consciousness was getting stronger by the minute.* \n\nHe had even started getting color back in his cheeks, and Jack was beginning to notice that the man seemed oddly familiar, the more human he became. \u201cCould be a side effect of this Nosher thinking,\" he guessed.\n\n\u201cThey're right behind us,\u201d the girl hissed to one of the roaches. \u201cBlast the next thing that comes down those stairs, you got me?\u201d \n\n**The bug clicked and hissed.** \n\n*Jack assumed it was a yes, because the two giant insects moved in and took up positions on either side of the hall.*\n\nJack bolted out the door and was relieved to see the Rabbit zip up just in time. Phineas sat behind the wheel, and the Things were nowhere in sight. Behind them, they heard the roaches open fire, and then a huge blast echoed down the hall. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s13.postimg.org/4klau8zdj/phin_rabbit.jpg)\n\nA gust of wind barreled out the door, raining cockroach guts over the three escaping figures. Jake stumbled, and Jack picked him up and shoved him into the back seat of the Rabbit.\n\nHe turned back to let the girl in, but she was gone. Phineas stood up on the running board, slapping the roof of the vehicle furiously. \u201cGet in the car! Let\u2019s go man!\u201d\n\n*By the time Jack had slid into the passenger seat, Phineas had the Rabbit patching out. They were up to top speed in a matter of seconds.*\n\n**\u201cFind a me a safe dime!\u201d Phineas yelled, standing as he worked the pedals and tried to see over the steering wheel at the same time.**\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack yelled over the whine of the engine.\n\n\u201cDime, a dimension, get us out of here.\u201d Phineas pleaded.\n\nJack opened the glove compartment and fiddled with the controls, but nothing happened.\n\n**\u201cDamn, guess I have to do everything, Phineas grumbled, \u201chere, take the wheel.\u201d** \n\n*The Leprechaun ducked under Jack\u2019s arms as he grabbed the steering wheel from his position in the passenger\u2019s seat.* \n\nPhineas leaned across the stick shift, his feet working the pedals as he started manipulating the glovebox controls. Jack\u2019s view through the windshield changed every few seconds. It was making steering from the passenger\u2019s seat even more of a challenge.\n\n*Meanwhile, Jake hunkered down in the back seat. From where Jack sat, he was not looking so good. He wondered how much time they had left.*\n\nJack swerved to miss a slow-moving vehicle that had just appeared as they shifted dimensions. Finally, Phineas settled for one that put them on a narrow two-lane country road. \n\nThe town disappeared, replaced by rows of fences. Phineas braked and turned off onto the shoulder of the road, rolling to a stop.\n\nJack\u2019s heartbeat slowly returned to normal. Meanwhile, Jake sounded like he was winding up in the back seat, his voice rolling into a high-pitched whine, perforated with short puffs of breath, like a woman in labor on a late-night sitcom.\n\n**\u201cYou okay, back there?\u201d Jack asked, climbing out onto the shoulder.** \n\nJake launched himself out of the back seat, landed face down in a shallow ditch, and promptly lost the entire contents of his stomach in a single \n\n\u201cralph\u201d.\n--------\n\nJack turned away, pulling his elbow up over his nose to avoid the horrendous smell of vomit. Meanwhile, Phineas dove around the hood of the car and into the ditch, pawing through the puke as if he was panning for gold. \n\n*A few seconds later, he came up for air, triumphantly holding the thumb drive.*\n\nHe stood, wiping his hands on Jake\u2019s jacket, and then looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s past time,\u201d He said, pulling the transmitter from the man\u2019s neck. Jake lolled into the ditch; his eyes fluttered, and Phineas shoved Jack toward the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n**\u201cLet\u2019s go. We don\u2019t want to be here when they come to collect him.\u201d He said, climbing into the passenger\u2019s seat.**\n\n***Will Jake see the girl again? What about his Nosher friend, what becomes of him? Will they ever get the smell out of the ALICE? Stay tuned!***\n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

While I didn't get to read or see the article until someone mailed me a physical copy, I found out that my article had started a number of discussions and follow-on commentary.\n\nDuring my stay at Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp I observed many economic theories put into effect by inmates and the prison administration, including Gresham's law, hyperinflation, currency exchange, and others.\n\nThere are two markets in prison, the \"Administration Run Market\" (ARM) and the \"Inmate Run Market\" (IRM). \n\nFor the ARM, family and friends can add money to your account through Western Union, MoneyGram, or mailing a check. These funds get added to your account fairly quickly and can be used almost immediately, however with a strict spending limit. You get 300 minutes of phone use per month for about $70, and email costs about $0.05 a minute and is only available at specific times to specific people. Once a week you can shop in the commissary with a $360 a month spending limit. Further, certain products have limits of how much you can buy, for example the Mackerel (described below). Alternatively, the IRM is where you can buy sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, Italian ices, hire a personal trainer, get a haircut, pay someone to clean your cube, repair a watch, even inmate run caterers for your birthday or going home party. Additionally there were inmate run 'stores' which sold commissary items at a markup since you could only commissary shop once a week.\n\n[![mackerel-203x300.png](https://s18.postimg.org/pkn7zm1h5/mackerel_203x300.png)](https://postimg.org/image/iu6qq6eb9/)\n\nThe Mackerel (meaning literal packets of fish) is one of the competing currencies in the IRM. It has utility by being one of the best sources of protein on the compound. You can save it for a long time, the shelf life is a few years. The price is relatively the same across all prisons in the country, so even if you transfer prisons your property comes with you, including your Mackerel which is worth the same somewhere else. Unlike tunafish, chicken packets and protein bars, more people eat Mackerel. Those other food items can be used as currency as well, for example the guy who fixes your watch may only accept protein bars because he hates fish. There was even a form of digital currency being used, which I will discuss in another post.\n\n[![pzyQaHU.png](https://s15.postimg.org/tggsqn3uj/pzy_Qa_HU.png)](https://postimg.org/image/nfj3tkh87/)\n\nUtility and medium of exchange give it some value but what about scarcity ? If there is a virtually unlimited amount of Mackerel in the IRM, just like the Federal Reserve printing money, there is no scarcity and hyperinflation can occure if it is debased. \n\nUsing a simple equation, 467 (Number of Inmates) * 14 (Maximum Quantity Allowed to Purchase Per Inmate) * 52 (weeks, assuming every inmate buys the maximum mount of Mackerel every week)\n\nSo if in 2015 we assume that the Supply and Velocity grows at the exact same rate with the Price Level and Transactions unchanging, the amount of Mackerel would essentially double on an even inflation rate. This does not factor in the 3 year shelf life, where expired Mackerel becomes a secondary currency. I will discuss in my next post. \n\nI like to believe that the value of money is determined also psychological factors, like a commodity and not only by mechanical or mathematical factors. In prison many of these psychological factors come into play.\n\n[![1867-1967-Ten-10\u00a2-Cents-Commemorative-Centennial.jpg](https://s15.postimg.org/yqgpkthrv/1867_1967_Ten_10_Cents_Commemorative_Centennial.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/ceiwrfinr/)\n\nMost people use Mackerel as a day-to-day currency for normal transactions, but for reasons I will explain in my next post, they are not the best long term store of value which is important for a currency. For longer term store of value, many inmates use stamps. Stamps have a set rate by the United States Postal Service and have similar characteristics as Mackerel aside for being edible. However, with the introduction of email on the compound many people stopped writing letters as email is cheaper and faster therefore reducing stamps ability to be a transactional currency as a majority of the inmates have no use for them. As a store of value they still hold weight because they are small and easy to store large amounts, while Mackerel is not.\n\nThe biggest value stamps have is that they can be mailed home and your family can redeem them for dollars as the local post office, but that feature can be stopped by better mail screening and overnight the stamp could lose its store of value utility. \n\nIn my next post I will discuss how currency exchangers work, what happens when the prison administration purposely floods the market, and how a secondary currency was created out of expired Mackerel called \u201cMoney Maks\u201d",

    "body": "Let's analyze more deeply the relationship between USD and Oil. This is a continuation of this 3 part series, and in this part I will describe my opinions how to trade Oil, despite it's unpredictability. Here is the previous part:\n\n<center>https://steemit.com/money/@profitgenerator/the-Oil-market-1-3</center>\n\n------------------------------------\n<br/>\n<center>[![oilfield-643836_1920.jpg](https://s16.postimg.org/j6asrkj79/oilfield_643836_1920.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/5cmg2iqlt/)</center>\n\n<center><h1>Oil and Dollar</h1></center>\n\nBefore we go into strategies, I have to explain more thoroughly what relationship I was talking about in the past article.\n\nSo we know that the Oil is denominated by the US Dollar, and we know that a cheap Oil is good for the US Economy, but I wasn't very precise here, this is not entirely true, there is something more here.\n\nFirst of all the commodity market is the only thing that keeps the US Dollar stable, since the Nixon lifting of the Gold standard. The USD is printed at will and the commodities are the only thing that give it some residual value.\n\nSo the commodity market has to be as liquid as possible in order to keep the USD stable, because every ounce of Gold, gram of grain or drop of Oil bought gives value to the USD, because it goes through the USD market.\n\nBut also the commodity market cannot be high in price, because that is bad for the USD. So you have to have a very liquid commodity market, but one that has low price. It sounds very contradictory (the velocity of money theory forbids this), so how you do you achieve this?\n\nWith a Paper Ponzi Scheme: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_certificate\n\nBy issuing commodities on paper, that are not backed by real commodities, or in other words extremely leveraged instruments. You can read more about this popular scam here:\n\n<center>http://www.silverdoctors.com/Gold/Gold-news/comex-Gold-leverage-skyrockets-to-a-shocking-5421/\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-06-25/comex-registered-silver-now-more-leveraged-Gold</center>\n\n<center>[![Leverage-Of-COMEX-Registered-Silver-Contracts.png](https://s17.postimg.org/bgdwcshn3/Leverage_Of_COMEX_Registered_Silver_Contracts.png)](https://postimg.org/image/vnrc53f4b/)</center>\n<center>*(Source: https://srsroccoreport.com)*</center>\n\nNow I am not sure if the same phenomena is happening to Oil as well, but it could be possible. The entire commodity market is undervalued while derivatives and over-leveraged scams are the popular choice of investment for investors.\n\nSo if this is true, then Oil, and the whole commodity market would be into a bullish run possibly. But what about the USD? Yes, the USD itself is in trouble too. The US national debt and outstanding liabilities are too big, and I think the FED will just do QE any minute now, printing up Dollars and perhaps pumping up the commodity market too.\n\nAlright so now it is very confusing, in the past article I established a bearish trend, and now I am saying a bullish scenario could happen? So which one is it. Well let's take them 1 by 1:\n\n* Venezuela economic collapse and Middle East wars = **Bullish**\n* Big Oil price not good for US so they will suppress it with any tool available = `Bearish`\n* OPEC increased Oil production together with [Iran's lifted embargo](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/world/middleeast/embargo-lifted-iranian-Oil-reaches-europe.html) = `Bearish` \n* Russia building Oil pipeline in South Europe =  `Bearish`\n* China investing in Africa and importing Oil =  **Bullish** (since the growing Chinese economy is a big Oil demand)\n* Rising Green Energy markets = `Bearish`\n* Paper ponzi scheme could collapse anytime = **Bullish**\n* New rounds of quantitative easing to erode global debts = **Bullish**\n\nSo it looks to me like a whipsaw, again it could be quantified to have more accurate numbers, but it looks like the risk is big in the market. I would certainly not go long or short on it, since it's pretty unpredictable based on these macroeconomic trends. Whatever monopoly controls the price of Oil has made sure to make the price unpredictable, so that people will be wiped out on both sides.\n\nSo then how to trade this, if long and short positions are too risky, what to do?\n\n----------------------\n<br/>\n<center>[![money-finance-bills-500.jpg](https://s17.postimg.org/simy7jp3j/money_finance_bills_500.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/kd4w9e0uj/)</center>\n\n\n<center><h1>Trading the Oil Market</h1></center>\n\nIf long and short positions are too risky, then hedging is the only strategy left in my opinion. I would not trade Oil naked, but if we hedge it with the right instrument, it could be profitable.\n\n<center><h2>[Hedging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_%28finance%29)</h2></center>\n\nBut what to hedge, what pairs to hedge and how? Well there are many combinations, and you have to find the pairs that will make you money nontheless.\n\nBut let's cut the crap, I have found a setup that is ultra profitable, and I will share it with you, in exchange you can donate me some SBD and upvote my post and follow me, that is the least you can do for showing you this ultra profitable trading strategy.\n\nSo here are the pairs:\n* Oil / USD\n* XAU / USD\n* USD / JPY\n* DJI / USD\n\nWe will construct our `artificial index` from these, I will call it `ProfitGenerator`:\n\n<center>[![profitgenerator.png](https://s12.postimg.org/421peh5v1/profitgenerator.png)](https://postimg.org/image/feeaw9ejt/)</center>\n\nThis is how `ProfitGenerator` looks like, it is really a @profitgenerator, going up and up since 2009. The formula is the following:\n`BUY   Oil / USD`\n`SELL   XAU / USD`\n`SELL   USD / JPY`\n`BUY   DJI / USD`\n\nSo basically by buying the DOW 30  and Oil, and selling Gold and the USD/JPY, we get this artificial index that always makes our profits go up since 2009. Of course it has dips and volatility, but the trend line looks to go up:\n\n<center>[![trend.png](https://s13.postimg.org/7c4281afb/trend.png)](https://postimg.org/image/mktzlt43n/)</center>\n\nI have extrapolated it linearly in the future, and it could be a profitable investment.Looks like easy money to me, I might check it out as well, and look for even better hedging strategies.\n\n---------------------------\n\nBasically this is how I would trade Oil at the moment, not naked, but put inside this nice hedging strategy. So if you decide to try it out, you should reward me after you made some profits!\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n*Data sources: http://www.investing.com*\n\n***Disclaimer: The information provided on this page might be incorrect.

    "body": "I did a few of these a while back, I was experimenting with the technique.  It was fun and I might well do some more, especially if there's an audience for them\n\nThe basic technique is to first to take a video clip and split it into a number of frames.   I expect you can do this easily in Photoshop or something, but I'm a command line kind of guy so I used ffmpeg and ImageMagick  - I learned a lot from reading [this post about it](\"https://room208.org/blog/posts/48793543478.html\").  I go for things that break down into about 12-24 frames because at 24 fps you're going to need 12 to get a half second loop.\n\nThen you load up each frame in your favourite graphics editor - I use GIMP because I'm cheap.  For each frame, you create a new transparent layer and trace over the bits of the frame that you want to replicate.  There's a bit of artistic choice in here about how much detail you want to include and how much colour filling you'll do.   But the most basic thing is to create a simplified line drawing by running the brush over the key elements.\n\nSo for this one of Johnny Rotten, I only took twelve frames from the beginning and only traced his face and the mic and filled in his hair with an approximation of it's actual colour!\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmZ5i1Sv2xYzQEWccL9VZVNoo56jv6xNMUxjbjnS7V7S9A'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmZ5i1Sv2xYzQEWccL9VZVNoo56jv6xNMUxjbjnS7V7S9A'/></a><a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/Qmaxqs77D6je2acPPF8FhdghAcAV9akbkRTpGdXY4jbZKn'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/Qmaxqs77D6je2acPPF8FhdghAcAV9akbkRTpGdXY4jbZKn'/></a>\n\nIf you give your transparent layer a white background you've then got a finished frame for your clip.  So export it and give it a number so that you know which order it goes in.  Again, Photoshop and GIMP probably have this built in, but I'm awkward that way and like to make things as close to \"by hand\" as I can.  This is also much slower, but it does feel like you've made something rather than just knowing which buttons to press.\n\nYou then sew the frames back up into a GIF file using ImageMagick's convert command - check out that [blog post again](\"https://room208.org/blog/posts/48793543478.html\") for the deep dive details.\n\nAlternatively you can take a still image and just trace it several times.  That's what I did with this one of Louis Armstrong.  Four frames, each slightly different from the others, when animated give it this jiggly quality as if he is playing.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmXUay7uUTx44JaaiEEzFLoCeAqLAfxoD4cv24SWA8MkqA'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmXUay7uUTx44JaaiEEzFLoCeAqLAfxoD4cv24SWA8MkqA'/></a>\n\nI'd love to see what other people make of this technique.

Future owners will receive dividends from transaction fees paid to BlockPay.<br>\nThe pre-ICO was done in 3 stages:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1st \u2014 exchange of OPENPOS for BLOCKPAY at the rate of 1.2 to 1 (fund of 600,000 tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>2nd \u2014 sale of BLOCKPAY at the price of 0.000288 BTC (fund of 1.4 mln tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>3rd \u2014 sale of BLOCKPAY at the price of 0.000360 BTC (fund of 3 mln tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The distribution of tokens is as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1.5% \u2014 marketing for pre-ICO</li>\n  <li>5% \u2014 pre-ICO</li>\n  <li>0.9% \u2014 early adopters</li>\n  <li>1.8% \u2014 advisors and partners</li>\n  <li>3.6% \u2014 marketing</li>\n  <li>7.2% \u2014 developers reward</li>\n  <li>80% \u2014 upcoming ICO in 2017</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The platform development plan:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The release of BlockPay \"S\" app for Android and payment terminals Odoo</li>\n  <li>BlockPay integration with leading payment terminals</li>\n  <li>API Development</li>\n  <li>The addition of a large number of fiat gateway exchanges and Escrow Services</li>\n  <li>The addition of anonymous transactions function</li>\n  <li>The development and release of the ECHO messenger for Android and iOS</li>\n  <li>Development of the first version of the BlockPay \"S\" app for iOS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project looks interesting, given the fact that they claim an integration with the ERP and CRM system<a href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\">Odoo</a> used by 60 thousand companies. The only disturbing thing is the absence of an open source software, and this spoils the whole picture. Transaction payments fee and, consequently, planned cash flow for investors are not sufficiently explained either. It should be kept in mind that this project is centralised, i.e. it belongs to the class of projects that demand trust in the founders and, correspondingly, require a thorough audit of operating activity.<br>\nCrowdsale summary:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Dates: 20 August 2016 \u2014 4 September 2016</li>\n  <li>Raised: ~ $657,000 (1096 BTC)</li>\n  <li>Tokens sold: 3.92 mln</li>\n  <li>Total number of tokens: 100 mln\u0414\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f: 20 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u2014 4 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For detailed information on the crowdsale, see: <a href=\"https://blockpay.ch/newsroom/investor-relations/blockpay-reserves/\">https://blockpay.ch/newsroom/investor-relations/blockpay-reserves/</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/BlockPay\">https://cyber.fund/system/BlockPay</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/AntShares\"><strong>AntShares</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>The project is interesting primarily due to the fact that it will be implemented using the Hyperledger platform.

Two funding campaigns start at the same time in September: the sale of Synereo Ltd shares on <a href=\"https://bnktothefuture.com/\">BnkToTheFuture</a> and of AMP tokens.<br>\nFollowing the first crowdfunding, the distribution of AMP was as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>2.72% (45.8 mln) \u2014 sold during the first crowdsale</li>\n  <li>11.9% (200 mln) \u2014 user rewards</li>\n  <li>8.92% (150 mln) \u2014 reserve for the content creators</li>\n  <li>11.9% (200 mln) \u2014 founders' reward</li>\n  <li>13.68% (230 mln) \u2014 bounty program</li>\n  <li>50.61% (850.4 mln) \u2014 next funding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Synereo revised their plans and now aim to develop a protocol similar to the <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/MaidSafeCoin\">SAFE Network</a>, which will include the following <a href=\"https://www.synereo.com/learn-more/\">components</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm</li>\n  <li>Distributed network of nodes connected on the principle of \"shards\", where blockchain is divided into many small segments</li>\n  <li>Distributed repository</li>\n  <li>Smart contracts</li>\n  <li>Social layer (a social network motivated according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/synereo/synereo.github.io/raw/master/whitepapers/synereo.pdf\">Attention</a> Economy Model)</li>\n  <li>The possibility of building distributed apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The grant program for dApps developers <a href=\"https://www.synereo.com/developers/\">Project 11</a> with a budget of 1.11 million AMP is already in operation.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The popular website <a href=\"http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/synereo/\">CoinMarketCap</a> misleadingly states current Synereo capitalisation at about $10-13 million, which is not true because it is only the cost of 62,580,000 AMP (3.72%) in circulation on the market. According to <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Synereo\">cyber \u2022 Fund</a>'s calculations, with the total of <a href=\"http://omnichest.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=39\">1.68 billion</a> tokens, Synereo's real capitalisation reaches $300 million.</p>\n<p>It has not been disclosed yet how many tokens will be put up for sale, but we can assume that the minimum amount claimed by Synereo is about $130-140 million in case the entire reserve is sold, which is 850.4 mln AMP. This is a very ambitious plan, taking into account current distribution and the market price of tokens. Besides, it should be kept in mind that after the launch of the network, additional 5% of AMP will be emitted every year. In my opinion, they should sell the whole reserve without fixed prices and with token distribution proportional to investments. It will provide normal distribution and a fair market capitalisation.</p>\n<p>Despite the presence of a strong team with an excellent technological vision, we consider the evaluation of $300 mln inadequate.</p>\n<p>Crowdsale summary:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Dates: September 2016</li>\n  <li>Total number of tokens: 1.68 billion AMP</li>\n  <li>Number of tokens for sale: unknown, probably 850.4 mln</li>\n  <li>Crowdsale goal: presumably ~ $130-140 million</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The crowdsale takes place here: <a href=\"https://www.synereo.com/sale\">https://www.synereo.com/sale</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Synereo\">https://cyber.fund/system/Synereo</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Golem\"><strong>Golem Project</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>The aim of the project is to adopt any customer personal computer for the work that is done today by servers, computing farms or supercomputers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the result, Golem Net will become a truly decentralised network where users' summarised machine power will provide any amount of hardware resources required. At the moment, there is no document explaining how exactly it would work.

Deals in the film and TV industry are the most difficult to arrange as they often involve hundreds of individual participants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u25cf On-demand video content portal (TVOD)<br>\nTVOD changes the way people watch entertainment programmes. S-DTV is born to create the TVOD portal for original content distribution, as well as for selected and acquired content. In addition to developing an interface on IPFS, S-DTV will use third-party portals such as GooglePlay, AppleTV iTunes and Vimeo to build a larger audience in a short time.</p>\n<p>Minimum investment goal \u2013 $500,000.</p>\n<p>Desirable funding \u2013 $7,5 mln.</p>\n<p>According to S-DTV documentation, Swiss company MME has developed a new, innovative organisational structure specifically for S-DTV: the Centralised Organised Distributed Company (CODE). It is the Swiss company, therefore, that will manage the finances and reinvest the income, while tokens will be used for paying out the dividends.</p>\n<p>Token distribution:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>400 mln Singular DTV GMBH</li>\n  <li>100 mln core investors</li>\n  <li>500 mln crowdsale</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Funds distribution in case if $7,5 mln is raised:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\"Singular\" season 1 (3 episodes of the mini-series): $3.25 mln</li>\n  <li>Documentary division: $0.50 mln</li>\n  <li>Development of the rights management platform: $2 mln</li>\n  <li>TVOD portal development: $1 mln</li>\n  <li>Marketing: $0.50 mln</li>\n  <li>Administrative, legal expenses and unforeseen circumstances: $0.25 mln</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crowdfunding is planned for September and will likely take place at Devcon2.</p>\n<p>The Ethereum and Consensys founder Joseph Lubin is included into the team as CTO.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in this project tokens only serve for distribution of dividends, and the project is centralised because 40% of tokens belong to Singular DTV GMBH. Another disadvantage is the fact that of the four declared founders/directors, only Zach Lebeau will work full time on the project. He is likely to be engaged in the studio rather than in the platform development; there are also risks associated with SEC.</p>\n<p>The main question is the development of the TVOD platform and the rights management platform: there is no understanding as to what kind of team will be working on it, and no technical description at the moment. If both platforms can be really implemented, the project is promising for investment.=</p>\n<p>For detailed information about the project, see: <a href=\"https://singulardtv.com/\">https://singulardtv.com/</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/SingularDTV\">https://cyber.fund/system/SingularDTV</a><br>\n</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Decent\"><strong>Decent</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>It is designed for creative people, writers, bloggers, journalists and their fans and followers.

The only reservation is that the market is not very vast, albeit actively developing. Besides, the motivation for developers and other market players is not very well thought through. In this regard, central players, who can also use smart contracts and predictions market to confirm the events results, may have an advantage. However, this project may indeed become the market leader on the condition of good community building and active incentivising of referees and the jury.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For detailed information about the project, see: <a href=\"https://firstblood.io/\">https://firstblood.io/</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/FirstBlood\">https://cyber.fund/system/FirstBlood</a><br>\n</p>\n<h2><br>\n<a href=\"https://ico.mass.network/#/\"><strong>MassNetwork</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>The three main entities:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Advertisers</li>\n  <li>Websites</li>\n  <li>Internet users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The basic principle is to follow the industry's trend to monetise customer attention and create a convenient and fair trading platform for all parties involved, including Internet users. Mass allows users to receive instant rewards for web surfing through the built-in p2p infrastructure based on the blockchain. As a result, advertisers will pay users a fair price for their attention and data without intermediaries.<br>\n</p>\n<p>An increasing number of customers are using ad-blocking software. Mass offers a browser extension and a mobile app that can block ads as well as protect personal data. Yet, their primary goal is not blocking but rather improving users' experience with advertising and rewarding them with cryptocurrency to establish a consumer-advertiser relationship and, therefore, reduce the number of ad-block users. Mass will also have a cryptocurrency wallet and blockchain-based payment system.</p>\n<p>Crowdsale dates: 6 September \u2014 1 December 2016</p>\n<p>Token distribution:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>70% to the crowdsale participants</li>\n  <li>30% to Mass team members</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mass plans to build its own full-blown infrastructure for advertising industry with an internal token. A similar solution has been already introduced to the market \u2013 the Brave browser. It blocks default ads and replaces it with incentivising ad materials. The bitcoins received from advertisers are distributed among users, the platform and the endorsing website. In my opinion, if Mass used smart contracts or a proprietary blockchain enabling further token emission to incentivise users and websites, they could compete with bitcoin. However, Mass token works on the bitcoin blockchain, which on the one hand makes it very secure, but on the other, has no advantage over bitcoin per se. In favour of bitcoin are accessibility, recognition, and a more stable price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Crowdsale takes place here: <a href=\"https://ico.mass.network/#/?aid=ep6oxa\">https://ico.mass.network/#/?aid=ep6oxa</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/MassNetwork\">https://cyber.fund/system/MassNetwork</a></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>All data and calculations are quoted as of 6 September 2016 with bitcoin price at $609.

    "body": "First things first, I want to thank the Steemit community for the response to one of the posts I mention here.   It was a nice feeling to see the voting!\n\nI do see a lot of posts in which the writer is disappointed in the feedback to their posts, especially in monetary value,   I too have felt that.  So I conducted an \"experiment\" of the \"throw it on the wall\" variety.  I took two old posts of mine from facebook, one of which I put a lot of thought into ( https://steemit.com/life/@stevescoins/defining-insanity-on-a-personal-basis ), and one which was snarky, short, and focused on booze! \nhttps://steemit.com/food/@stevescoins/recipe-1-hot-buttered-rum\n\nI did not try to compare the success rate by posting in the areas I usually post; security politics and Gridcoin.  These are both very small niche interests, and they very likely will never get a lot of response.  I do not provide value for the reading time of most people when I write in these areas.  Mental health versus booze?  THAT is a good experiment!\n\nThe recipe for Hot Buttered Rum was the clear winner, I think I reeled in a Whale within the 1st 15 minutes.  This was the second time I  made more than a  few dollars, but this was a little more than a buck by a bit!  Why is that?  Butter is good, sweet is good, rum is good.  People like those things.\n\nSo the moral?  Write and post for yourself FIRST.  I enjoyed writing both posts.  But if you want to make money from a market, you have to provide value to that market.    You don't need to spend all day baiting Whales, but an occasional attempt to identify market trends and appeal to what the voter wants is not going to kill the artiste or the prophet within you.  I said in the last paragraph that MOST folks won't read about the politics of security  or about Gridcoin?  I still write on these things, and there are some folks that come by and visit  (thank yall, btw!)\n\nAlso, consider that there is a luck of the draw.  If the person that your post has value for does not see it, new posts are taking the position for curator upvoting.  Remember that curators are rewarded on thier voting prowess, which does not necessarily mean the post was good.  Did you write a great post that nobody read?  Write a followup!\n\nFinally, there MAY be a value issue with articles that take too long to read...I don't know about that, so I'm going to shut up now '>",

    "body": "### <center>These photos were taken in July, 2016 at sunrise.</center>\n\n<center>![Sunrise at Buccaneer Bay by Meredith Loughran](https://merej99.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/bucbay1-e1473966204550.jpg)\nTaken with a Canon Powershot SX1 IS</center><br>\n# The story behind the shot\nIn July, 2016, due to a series of unfortunate events, I was faced with eviction with no immediate place to go.  \n\nWe begged and borrowed from any place we could and managed to have a little money in the bank - just not enough to save our house.  We were out of time and needed to make some hard decisions.\n\nWhat I soon found out was once residents are served eviction papers in Florida, you have 24 hours to get out of the house.  ***24 hours!***\n\nSitting between a rock and a hard place, we had secured a moving truck and a storage unit.  \n\n### We make a great team\nMy husband and I have been through so much adversity throughout our relationship.  Death in the family, job loss, the dynamics of raising kids and dealing with my poisonous ex-husband, moving, starting a business, closing the business, cars repossessed...  Pretty much anything that could test the strength of our marriage is what we went through.\n\nSometimes I think back and go: *How does this keep happening?*  What decisions are we making that keep us stuck in this terrible cycle of unfortunate events?\n\n#### We balance each other\nMy husband is high-strung where I've learned to be grounded and stable.  So the higher he goes, the lower I go.  Do you know what I mean?\n\nIf he's bouncing off the walls and completely stressed, I remain still and calm.  So if he's a skyscraper, I'm the basement foundation.  I'll let him reach for the skies but I keep him grounded and pull him back down to earth too.\n\nConversely, when I'm too low and feel like I can't take another step, he lifts me up.  He is my soul provider.  Maybe being casual friends for 20 years before we began dating has something to do with it.  There are no secrets between us, which also means we have the freedom of expression without being crucified for having opposing views sometimes.\n\n## Facing homelessness\nEven though there is a 24 hour eviction, a few benefits of living in Florida includes decent weather.  You can camp all year without fear of dying from exposure or hypothermia.  Available houses are everywhere and you can generally get into them rather quickly.\n\nAs things generally go with my husband and I, nothing happens easily.  Well...  Okay, that's not entirely true.  ***If things are meant to be, they come very easily*** but when we try to force something, it becomes impossible and we may as well be knocking our heads against a brick wall.  LOL  \n<center>![Fek it, we're Irish - from Pixabay](http://scribblingbandits.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fekit-ur-irish.jpg)\nimage source: pixabay</center>\n\n<br>\nMy husband was doing his usual pacing when I said, \"I've got an idea and I want you to hear me out.\"\n\nI had been doing some online research and found a local motel that could accommodate 3 people and pets.  Being off-season in Florida, the weekly rate was under $500.  But spending $500 meant that it was $500 less in the bank for a security deposit should we find a place to go.\n\nIt took him about an hour to say, \"Do it.\"\n\nLiterally working through the day and night to get our things off property, we got everything out but my bucket garden and potted blueberry bush.\n\n### We've got a week to find a home\nEven through all of this, I remained calm - almost peaceful.  Good things happen for us when we don't force it and the stars align.  So I just my faith out to the universe and knew that no matter what, we would work hard and we would be provided for.\n\n<center>***Sometimes you just have to put positive vibes out there and hope for a good return.***</center>\n\nBeing in the motel meant free wi-fi so we were pretty diligent about home searches.  We looked at a few properties and quickly rejected them.  Mind you, we don't look at the cosmetics of a house - stuff that can be cleaned or painted; we look at the bones of the house - water pump, electric panel, roof, walls, floor...\n\nMost of the housing we looked at didn't even have good bones or were located in seriously bad neighborhoods.  We don't require a lot but we do have our limits.\n\nOne week turned into two.  Luckily my husband is employed full time, but we were eating through our savings.  I cut costs where I could, like the food budget.  With nothing but a little microwave in the room, I kept our daily food budget down to about $10 a day to feed 3 adults.  Living conditions included one room with 2 queen-sized beds, 3 adults, 2 dogs and 4 ferrets.\n#### But it wasn't so bad!\nWe didn't have neighbors in the rooms next to us.  We had free wi-fi and access to the pool.  The cleaning ladies were polite and kept us in clean towels and toilet paper.  Most importantly, we had a roof over our head and food in our belly.\n\nI have a hard time saying we actually *were* homeless because we weren't living out of our car.  We had niceties.  But at the same time we weren't there because we were on vacation, you know?  There was no other place to go.\n\n**BONUS: Our room faced east for stunning sunrises like this.**\n\n<center>![Sunrise over Buccaneer Bay wide view by Meredith Loughran](https://merej99.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/bucbay2-e1473966000877.jpg)\nA wider view of sunrise over Buccaneer Bay</center>\n\n## And then the stars began to align\nWith 3 more days left in week two, I admit I was beginning to stress a little.  ***Ya think?!?***\nAnd then we got the call.  There's a house available as long as we can commit to a six-month lease.  And because my husband had helped them with some of their plumbing problems in the past, they were willing to stretch out the security deposit over a few of his paychecks.  **A stepping stone.**\n\nIn that time a friend of mine introduced me to #Steemit\n\nSo here we are, in a 'stepping stone' house, recovering from the last series of unfortunate events.\nCall me crazy, but I feel truly blessed.\n\n> To quote from the movie ***Bridge of Spies, 2015***\n> James Donovan: \"Do you *ever* worry?\"\n> Rudolph Abel: \"Would it help?\"\n\n### <center>Well, would it?</center>\n-----\n### Wall of #Steemit love:\nThis awesome name in peppers was created by @papa-pepper: ![@papa-pepper made my name in peppers!

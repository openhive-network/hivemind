K\u00e9ops my cat starts singing tour and stops only when he filled his mess tin. Sweety then, the cat of my son jumps on the furniture in the kitchen and also claimed his bowl. Kashmir him not to come after me, until I make him hugs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/DSCN0477faad0.jpg\" width=\"2758\" height=\"2736\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/keops0029612b.jpg\" width=\"1464\" height=\"1162\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Au-sommet81f7b.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"645\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;A small cup of coffee and I'm up for the day. After my shower, I have to feed the fish pond and two hens, they are waiting for me impatiently for me to release them from their cages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/16e3c4.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"464\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Photo0224b24a.jpg\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;6:15, I start my bag on her arm, my water bottle and my biscuit for lunch. On the road I am alone, few vehicles I meet. Great to run your car on a deserted road. In the winter when it snowed, I am the first to make tracks in the whiteness of the snow grows like cotton wool, sometimes, crazy beyond me and skids, it is an adrenaline rush. In summer the sun rises gives the sky a color of red sweetness, yellow, orange. In autumn, the trees begin to change color, it is a season because I love the beauty of trees is unique.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/d85917d4a45b3d581b5f40d1d7a7504a3bb1e.jpg\" width=\"236\" height=\"234\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Here I come down the street or is my workplace, hospital, regional hospital, the CHR. Vehicles coming after one another because we start at 7am. The staff is found, speak, tells their evening then everyone goes to the same place: the time clock, control object of our hours worked.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/chr841bd.jpg\" width=\"916\" height=\"613\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;In the ladies locker room, it gets held: white jacket with blue and green patterns representing the logo of the institution, blue pants with various pockets which we do not serve!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/DSCN1513-Copiee7a4d.jpg\" width=\"410\" height=\"681\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We arrive in our service, mine is the neurological rehabilitation service: we give up (or so) of people who have a stroke, an accident with neurological trauma, people who have multiple sclerosis or Guillain barred and other chronic diseases whose name is almost unknown.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Capture2bb0b8.jpg\" width=\"539\" height=\"627\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/370086-1f7d83.jpg\" width=\"325\" height=\"300\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/Capturec0ccc.jpg\" width=\"589\" height=\"598\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We start our day with a report on each patient last night, we have 20 in service. After beginning the nursing: we make the toilet of the patient who is totally dependent. We get up in the chair. For others, we must educate, continue the actions he has learned with the therapist in the individual care, the patient should regain maximum independence so they can go home and take care only . It's a job that can last from 3 months to 6 months beyond, we can not do anything for them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/souleve-malade-foldyadb08.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Headline in this service is: you come to bed but you leave again walking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sometimes, we fail either because the patient does not want a return to autonomy, or because the patient is too ill. We give the same chance to everyone, rich, poor, alcoholic, drug addict, young or old.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The management of a patient goes from shaving the beard of a man to the presentation on the toilet, the room arrangement the carefully tended beds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Lunch arrived around 8:30 am, few patient is in the dining hall for breakfast, other unfinished eat in bed Logistical assistance serves meals that are different if the patient is diabetic, diet, dieters, old, or in solid supply resumption. You should know that when the patient has had a stroke, a stroke, swallowing is absent, which means that if the patient eats a sandwich, but he swallows the bread goes in the bronchial tubes and not in the stomach, giving a false swallowing, bronchi become infected and it's a disaster. So this patient who made false swallowing should eat while cream consistency and drink thickened liquid. Which is not very good but I admit it must go through these stages in order to re-eat a day normally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Physiotherapists arrive at 9am and leave a 17h, occupational therapists also. There is also a neuropsychologist, a speech therapist and all do work that allows the patient to regain maximum independence, which means that the patient all day is busy. Visitors can come between 14:30 and 19:30.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>After lunch, we continue our work, when all is well, we finish around 10:30 or 11am but sometimes it is noon we are still in the rooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In terms of handling, the entry of the patient, it is usually in bed or in a wheelchair with a right hemiplegia or left, some have forgotten that they had half a disabled body, so it must withstand and no wear and show him how to do with one leg to go from wheelchair to bed and vice versa. Others are completely invalid, they know not move neither arms nor legs, and for those, or we wear them either we lift them with a forklift.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>During dinner, we feed the disabled and we encode our care in the computer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Around 13h, we are a few naps after going on the toilet. Sometimes we have a problem in the pants, oops! When everyone is changed to bed, we have a service change ratio and the time, the hour of the end of our service is lagging. At 14h is the start of the morning shift. For my part, I take a good shower and I take the way home or waiting for my cats and my dog makes me a big party.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We must not believe that the nursing profession is simple, each service is different and you can not compare the care of each other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I hope I have not bothered you with this long text, I wish you a good day to you all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

It's funny how we can get so caught up in work and the business of a crazy life and miss the simply beauty along the way. Sometime you've just got to stop and smell the roses; and while you're there, take a picture!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-3-1024x768-300x225.jpeg\"/></p>\n<p>These aren't roses, I know: they're wild flowers. They don't get the nurture and care that roses do, and yet they are provided for and they bloom into beautiful blossoms in their own time. They have a harder life than others, and that's how we humans are as well. Some of us were well taken care of growing up and were treated like roses, while others were left in the field to grow up alone and without the love and care we should have had. But we are all beautiful in our own ways and if we survive long enough, we will blossom into something spectacular.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_6440-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Colorado mountain rivers</h2>\n<p>When the snow on the tops of the mountains melt, it feed the rushing rivers that carve their way down the mountainside. The climbing is excellent, the whether and the views are truly gorgeous, but something about the rivers rushing through the mountains draws you in. There is a memorization about the brave rivers unafraid of the mountains and simply rushing on by recklessly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_6031-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Mississippi at sunset</h2>\n<p>Sometimes the world just slows down and magic happens.

All stories depicted here either happened directly to people I knew, or were described to me as &nbsp;a <em>it's-russia-get-used-to-it </em>anecdote.<br>\nYes, I will be talking about corruption and paying people under the table for things but bear in mind that even though it seems like a common practice definitely not all people do that and not all people experience the phenomenon.</p>\n<h3>A ROUTINE POLICE CHECK<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p>It is said that it is extremely wise to keep 2k-5k Rubles (about 28-68 Euro, 30-77 Dollars, 23-58 Pounds) in your registration papers at all times. They tend to disappear when you get your documents back from the officer... If one does not have such loose change, the guy tends to make one's life difficult. \"<em>You were speeding\", \"You didn't stop at the STOP sign\", \"You're light is out\" </em>etc. Driving is another interesting phenomenon in Moscow. You might think that since the metro is so packed, the streets will be empty. On the contrary, but I will not get into that right now as that makes a completely different post... &nbsp;However, what I will tell you is &nbsp;how one of my students passed her driving exam, which leads us to...</p>\n<h3>PAYING TO PASS AN EXAM</h3>\n<p>After her first failed attempt, my student looked at her instructor/examiner and asked: \"Could you please tell me what I did wrong, so I can work on it in the future?\" He stared back at her surprised and announced: \"Well, you didn't pay me extra, what do you expect?!\" At that point even I was shocked - \"So people openly tell you they want money?!\" \"Get used to it Kasia, It's Russia....\"<br>\nNeedless to say, she was forced to pay the second time around and surprise, surprise, she passed....<br>\n<br>\nI taught English in a company. I came one week, and saw that everyone was kind of in a rush and slightly agitated. I asked what the problem was and they said they were waiting for an audit. I remember wishing them good luck... One lady looked at me and smiled \"We paid the guys to look the other way, it will be fine!\" I didn't even bother to comment as I had aleady known there was no point...</p>\n<h3>GETTING INTO A PRIVATE EVENT</h3>\n<p>It was the three of us - my BF, his friend and I. We wanted to do some clubbing and the friend decided we should go to a very trendy bar in the heart of Moscow. He had a loyalty card there and was well known among the bouncers. We didn't really look the part, but a hefty fee paid for each of us (by the friend) was enough to let us in...</p>\n<p>That was a minor party. Let's talk about the big stuff, involving bigger money!<br>\nIf you know someone, who knows someone, who knows someone you might be able to (legally) attend the dress rehearsal of the famous Victory Parade in May (the 9th to be exact). It costs about 10k (137 Euro, 116 Pounds , 153 Dollars) Watch fragments of the video below to see the magnitude of what I am talking about.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The whole thing is long, play with it a little bit. The good stuff starts at about 40 minutes. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4qBu3EvraPWezHbaC7npIQ\">Source</a></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EI3FYynz-Q</p>\n<p>To enter the actual parade however, you need to be a prominent member of the society (e.g. ex-military) or someone famous or filthy rich :)</p>\n<p>The event itself is quite impressive and for soldiers taking part in the march it is an honor among honors. &nbsp;<br>\nWe had the privilege of living 15 minutes on foot from the Red Square so we saw all the preparations and marches right outside our windows (till 11pm at night...)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3OMfOqwX2pQ5BYeql8V1tg4J6VcMzG75pLD-nhsfHw0BYFLEQOQSeVl-sVdEkDwS6VfPco-FukpjwQONwimoOhzzT4GIPDt_VGbJfNDYaltTvEcyOFK5do7PZD1-tjDW0nxKYhUQdxG4yoxX6ZS590fMaveLKSI2Voz579yTME9U8D7UgN7R3ufBrAcq0KV8kA9VqMVxryabh2X_jBiMnP3Uwjj_hrWn3ARzHggZMRuo3G3ORSKDpoqcBA25bRDeWHe7nVT4X58NolQ4yY8HVjzyUr4zDneI8dy_eHnSf0F0FBZ8kn4NQQ3ueVR84tu-Ot64CZb9a1SetmKmupvAxBbuS8z3jBsvCECD8A5jz9qevTOkgHEbV0z2hVteH64gCLg3OI9mRVqw2GWAYwNSUlGGtwCxmwXq3p_j_igwncarIhIF2HX_bV0ACrucmewR6IiIdVfaKKAO9g2ycLbJRr_SBwE9TxBND9ar0R267Grzq5SHywG71h1nxZnXInW-HQ2l1cou8zqdiEUanqkeSbgIunZVNBcEnYYinmF-WZd5y0_Luc8rdDYy0GlKAtAJ4z0-woKDs6d_XKWhiWsYOAW3rWwCe3cJylK_6H7wNO2PlBKL=w1163-h775-no\" width=\"1162\" height=\"775\"/></p>\n<p>PS. I am aware that my portrayal of Moscow might seem bleak and depressing. Believe me, it was not.

Great more great reading for you [on my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr)! Be sure to follow me for awesome daily updates in your feed and leave me comments. I love comments!***\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not that smart when we\u2019re under. We can really only do what we hear them telling us to do.\u201d Jake whispered, calmly as the big guard moved within inches of the wall, snorting. The guard turned, blasted a hole in the ceiling with his gun and charged back into the hall. \n\n*They heard him blasting the door of the next room open.*\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve got this one on a signal blocker and there\u2019s not much time.\u201d \n\nThe girl turned and ran to a corner, where an iron hand rail rose up out of the floor in a curve. She disappeared through the floor and as Jack followed, he found a narrow, spiraling stair that led below. \n\nHe lost his footing and slid down the stairs, narrowly missing the girl. She stood in the room below, with ear to the door that led into the hall.\n\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.org/90derv079/spiral_stair.jpg)\n\n*Jake followed close behind. The girl with the violet eyes opened the door and stepped out into the hall with the awakened Nosher right behind her and Jack bringing up the rear. Jack had no idea what to do next, but the girl seemed to be in her element, and willing to help.*\n\n**Hopefully, she was not leading them into more danger.** \n\nHe followed her past one door, and into the darkened room where they had first started. It was empty, which could only mean one thing. The Noshers who had recently occupied it were upstairs right now with the ugly guard. They were looking for Jack and the others and would soon head back down.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we just get out of here?\u201d Jack said. He stood with his back to the wall and the door opened a crack so that one eye could see down the hall toward the upper stairs.\n\n\u201cNot without these,\u201d the girl walked to where the guard had been and pointed up at the weapons, suspended above. She ran a hand along the doorframe, \u201cIt ought to be along here somewhere.\u201d She said.\n\n**\u201cWhat is?\u201d Jack hissed, shifting as her body pressed against his.** \n\nShe ran her hand along the top of the doorframe. He froze; she smelled good. It had been a long time since a girl had gotten this close to him, junior prom, in fact. He did not have a lot of time for dating with his work schedule. \n\n*To top it off, the smell of burnt fries that clung to him even after an hour in the shower was hardly an aphrodisiac.*\n\nThe girl put one hand on his chest and stood on tiptoe, pressing tight against him. \u201cOh, don\u2019t kid yourself; you just happened to be in my way.\u201d She laughed, scornfully, and pressed a hidden button at the top right corner of the door. Weapons rained down with a crash, and she quickly chose two handguns, handing one to Jack. \n\nShe pressed the button again, and the remaining weapons zipped back up into position. Jack had to grip the gun in his hand firmly to keep it from joining them.\n\n![enter image description here](https://s13.postimg.org/xp1l7jjyv/guns.jpg)\n\n**\u201cElectro magnet,\u201d she said and opened the door, moving out, weapon first.**\n\n\u201cI knew that,\u201d Jack said. He flattened himself against the hallway wall, like a TV detective. The magnet had occurred to him, but in his addled state, he had not really grasped the concept. Mostly he just did not like the idea of her being smarter than he was. \n\n\u201cKeep up\u201d he hissed to Jake, who had managed to grab a revolver.\nThe three moved quickly down the hall and turned toward the front door. The two roaches Jack had seen earlier, peered out from either side. \n\n**They had weapons leveled in his direction.**\n\n*The girl crouched and moved forward as if she were still a Nosher. It worked. Jack followed suit, and Jake did his best. His human consciousness was getting stronger by the minute.* \n\nHe had even started getting color back in his cheeks, and Jack was beginning to notice that the man seemed oddly familiar, the more human he became. \u201cCould be a side effect of this Nosher thinking,\" he guessed.\n\n\u201cThey're right behind us,\u201d the girl hissed to one of the roaches. \u201cBlast the next thing that comes down those stairs, you got me?\u201d \n\n**The bug clicked and hissed.** \n\n*Jack assumed it was a yes, because the two giant insects moved in and took up positions on either side of the hall.*\n\nJack bolted out the door and was relieved to see the Rabbit zip up just in time. Phineas sat behind the wheel, and the Things were nowhere in sight. Behind them, they heard the roaches open fire, and then a huge blast echoed down the hall. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s13.postimg.org/4klau8zdj/phin_rabbit.jpg)\n\nA gust of wind barreled out the door, raining cockroach guts over the three escaping figures. Jake stumbled, and Jack picked him up and shoved him into the back seat of the Rabbit.\n\nHe turned back to let the girl in, but she was gone. Phineas stood up on the running board, slapping the roof of the vehicle furiously. \u201cGet in the car! Let\u2019s go man!\u201d\n\n*By the time Jack had slid into the passenger seat, Phineas had the Rabbit patching out. They were up to top speed in a matter of seconds.*\n\n**\u201cFind a me a safe dime!\u201d Phineas yelled, standing as he worked the pedals and tried to see over the steering wheel at the same time.**\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack yelled over the whine of the engine.\n\n\u201cDime, a dimension, get us out of here.\u201d Phineas pleaded.\n\nJack opened the glove compartment and fiddled with the controls, but nothing happened.\n\n**\u201cDamn, guess I have to do everything, Phineas grumbled, \u201chere, take the wheel.\u201d** \n\n*The Leprechaun ducked under Jack\u2019s arms as he grabbed the steering wheel from his position in the passenger\u2019s seat.* \n\nPhineas leaned across the stick shift, his feet working the pedals as he started manipulating the glovebox controls. Jack\u2019s view through the windshield changed every few seconds. It was making steering from the passenger\u2019s seat even more of a challenge.\n\n*Meanwhile, Jake hunkered down in the back seat. From where Jack sat, he was not looking so good. He wondered how much time they had left.*\n\nJack swerved to miss a slow-moving vehicle that had just appeared as they shifted dimensions. Finally, Phineas settled for one that put them on a narrow two-lane country road. \n\nThe town disappeared, replaced by rows of fences. Phineas braked and turned off onto the shoulder of the road, rolling to a stop.\n\nJack\u2019s heartbeat slowly returned to normal. Meanwhile, Jake sounded like he was winding up in the back seat, his voice rolling into a high-pitched whine, perforated with short puffs of breath, like a woman in labor on a late-night sitcom.\n\n**\u201cYou okay, back there?\u201d Jack asked, climbing out onto the shoulder.** \n\nJake launched himself out of the back seat, landed face down in a shallow ditch, and promptly lost the entire contents of his stomach in a single \n\n\u201cralph\u201d.\n--------\n\nJack turned away, pulling his elbow up over his nose to avoid the horrendous smell of vomit. Meanwhile, Phineas dove around the hood of the car and into the ditch, pawing through the puke as if he was panning for gold. \n\n*A few seconds later, he came up for air, triumphantly holding the thumb drive.*\n\nHe stood, wiping his hands on Jake\u2019s jacket, and then looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s past time,\u201d He said, pulling the transmitter from the man\u2019s neck. Jake lolled into the ditch; his eyes fluttered, and Phineas shoved Jack toward the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n**\u201cLet\u2019s go. We don\u2019t want to be here when they come to collect him.\u201d He said, climbing into the passenger\u2019s seat.**\n\n***Will Jake see the girl again? What about his Nosher friend, what becomes of him? Will they ever get the smell out of the ALICE? Stay tuned!***\n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

While I didn't get to read or see the article until someone mailed me a physical copy, I found out that my article had started a number of discussions and follow-on commentary.\n\nDuring my stay at Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp I observed many economic theories put into effect by inmates and the prison administration, including Gresham's law, hyperinflation, currency exchange, and others.\n\nThere are two markets in prison, the \"Administration Run Market\" (ARM) and the \"Inmate Run Market\" (IRM). \n\nFor the ARM, family and friends can add money to your account through Western Union, MoneyGram, or mailing a check. These funds get added to your account fairly quickly and can be used almost immediately, however with a strict spending limit. You get 300 minutes of phone use per month for about $70, and email costs about $0.05 a minute and is only available at specific times to specific people. Once a week you can shop in the commissary with a $360 a month spending limit. Further, certain products have limits of how much you can buy, for example the Mackerel (described below). Alternatively, the IRM is where you can buy sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, Italian ices, hire a personal trainer, get a haircut, pay someone to clean your cube, repair a watch, even inmate run caterers for your birthday or going home party. Additionally there were inmate run 'stores' which sold commissary items at a markup since you could only commissary shop once a week.\n\n[![mackerel-203x300.png](https://s18.postimg.org/pkn7zm1h5/mackerel_203x300.png)](https://postimg.org/image/iu6qq6eb9/)\n\nThe Mackerel (meaning literal packets of fish) is one of the competing currencies in the IRM. It has utility by being one of the best sources of protein on the compound. You can save it for a long time, the shelf life is a few years. The price is relatively the same across all prisons in the country, so even if you transfer prisons your property comes with you, including your Mackerel which is worth the same somewhere else. Unlike tunafish, chicken packets and protein bars, more people eat Mackerel. Those other food items can be used as currency as well, for example the guy who fixes your watch may only accept protein bars because he hates fish. There was even a form of digital currency being used, which I will discuss in another post.\n\n[![pzyQaHU.png](https://s15.postimg.org/tggsqn3uj/pzy_Qa_HU.png)](https://postimg.org/image/nfj3tkh87/)\n\nUtility and medium of exchange give it some value but what about scarcity ? If there is a virtually unlimited amount of Mackerel in the IRM, just like the Federal Reserve printing money, there is no scarcity and hyperinflation can occure if it is debased. \n\nUsing a simple equation, 467 (Number of Inmates) * 14 (Maximum Quantity Allowed to Purchase Per Inmate) * 52 (weeks, assuming every inmate buys the maximum mount of Mackerel every week)\n\nSo if in 2015 we assume that the Supply and Velocity grows at the exact same rate with the Price Level and Transactions unchanging, the amount of Mackerel would essentially double on an even inflation rate. This does not factor in the 3 year shelf life, where expired Mackerel becomes a secondary currency. I will discuss in my next post. \n\nI like to believe that the value of money is determined also psychological factors, like a commodity and not only by mechanical or mathematical factors. In prison many of these psychological factors come into play.\n\n[![1867-1967-Ten-10\u00a2-Cents-Commemorative-Centennial.jpg](https://s15.postimg.org/yqgpkthrv/1867_1967_Ten_10_Cents_Commemorative_Centennial.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/ceiwrfinr/)\n\nMost people use Mackerel as a day-to-day currency for normal transactions, but for reasons I will explain in my next post, they are not the best long term store of value which is important for a currency. For longer term store of value, many inmates use stamps. Stamps have a set rate by the United States Postal Service and have similar characteristics as Mackerel aside for being edible. However, with the introduction of email on the compound many people stopped writing letters as email is cheaper and faster therefore reducing stamps ability to be a transactional currency as a majority of the inmates have no use for them. As a store of value they still hold weight because they are small and easy to store large amounts, while Mackerel is not.\n\nThe biggest value stamps have is that they can be mailed home and your family can redeem them for dollars as the local post office, but that feature can be stopped by better mail screening and overnight the stamp could lose its store of value utility. \n\nIn my next post I will discuss how currency exchangers work, what happens when the prison administration purposely floods the market, and how a secondary currency was created out of expired Mackerel called \u201cMoney Maks\u201d",

    "body": "Let's analyze more deeply the relationship between USD and Oil. This is a continuation of this 3 part series, and in this part I will describe my opinions how to trade Oil, despite it's unpredictability. Here is the previous part:\n\n<center>https://steemit.com/money/@profitgenerator/the-Oil-market-1-3</center>\n\n------------------------------------\n<br/>\n<center>[![oilfield-643836_1920.jpg](https://s16.postimg.org/j6asrkj79/oilfield_643836_1920.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/5cmg2iqlt/)</center>\n\n<center><h1>Oil and Dollar</h1></center>\n\nBefore we go into strategies, I have to explain more thoroughly what relationship I was talking about in the past article.\n\nSo we know that the Oil is denominated by the US Dollar, and we know that a cheap Oil is good for the US Economy, but I wasn't very precise here, this is not entirely true, there is something more here.\n\nFirst of all the commodity market is the only thing that keeps the US Dollar stable, since the Nixon lifting of the Gold standard. The USD is printed at will and the commodities are the only thing that give it some residual value.\n\nSo the commodity market has to be as liquid as possible in order to keep the USD stable, because every ounce of Gold, gram of grain or drop of Oil bought gives value to the USD, because it goes through the USD market.\n\nBut also the commodity market cannot be high in price, because that is bad for the USD. So you have to have a very liquid commodity market, but one that has low price. It sounds very contradictory (the velocity of money theory forbids this), so how you do you achieve this?\n\nWith a Paper Ponzi Scheme: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_certificate\n\nBy issuing commodities on paper, that are not backed by real commodities, or in other words extremely leveraged instruments. You can read more about this popular scam here:\n\n<center>http://www.silverdoctors.com/Gold/Gold-news/comex-Gold-leverage-skyrockets-to-a-shocking-5421/\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-06-25/comex-registered-silver-now-more-leveraged-Gold</center>\n\n<center>[![Leverage-Of-COMEX-Registered-Silver-Contracts.png](https://s17.postimg.org/bgdwcshn3/Leverage_Of_COMEX_Registered_Silver_Contracts.png)](https://postimg.org/image/vnrc53f4b/)</center>\n<center>*(Source: https://srsroccoreport.com)*</center>\n\nNow I am not sure if the same phenomena is happening to Oil as well, but it could be possible. The entire commodity market is undervalued while derivatives and over-leveraged scams are the popular choice of investment for investors.\n\nSo if this is true, then Oil, and the whole commodity market would be into a bullish run possibly. But what about the USD? Yes, the USD itself is in trouble too. The US national debt and outstanding liabilities are too big, and I think the FED will just do QE any minute now, printing up Dollars and perhaps pumping up the commodity market too.\n\nAlright so now it is very confusing, in the past article I established a bearish trend, and now I am saying a bullish scenario could happen? So which one is it. Well let's take them 1 by 1:\n\n* Venezuela economic collapse and Middle East wars = **Bullish**\n* Big Oil price not good for US so they will suppress it with any tool available = `Bearish`\n* OPEC increased Oil production together with [Iran's lifted embargo](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/world/middleeast/embargo-lifted-iranian-Oil-reaches-europe.html) = `Bearish` \n* Russia building Oil pipeline in South Europe =  `Bearish`\n* China investing in Africa and importing Oil =  **Bullish** (since the growing Chinese economy is a big Oil demand)\n* Rising Green Energy markets = `Bearish`\n* Paper ponzi scheme could collapse anytime = **Bullish**\n* New rounds of quantitative easing to erode global debts = **Bullish**\n\nSo it looks to me like a whipsaw, again it could be quantified to have more accurate numbers, but it looks like the risk is big in the market. I would certainly not go long or short on it, since it's pretty unpredictable based on these macroeconomic trends. Whatever monopoly controls the price of Oil has made sure to make the price unpredictable, so that people will be wiped out on both sides.\n\nSo then how to trade this, if long and short positions are too risky, what to do?\n\n----------------------\n<br/>\n<center>[![money-finance-bills-500.jpg](https://s17.postimg.org/simy7jp3j/money_finance_bills_500.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/kd4w9e0uj/)</center>\n\n\n<center><h1>Trading the Oil Market</h1></center>\n\nIf long and short positions are too risky, then hedging is the only strategy left in my opinion. I would not trade Oil naked, but if we hedge it with the right instrument, it could be profitable.\n\n<center><h2>[Hedging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_%28finance%29)</h2></center>\n\nBut what to hedge, what pairs to hedge and how? Well there are many combinations, and you have to find the pairs that will make you money nontheless.\n\nBut let's cut the crap, I have found a setup that is ultra profitable, and I will share it with you, in exchange you can donate me some SBD and upvote my post and follow me, that is the least you can do for showing you this ultra profitable trading strategy.\n\nSo here are the pairs:\n* Oil / USD\n* XAU / USD\n* USD / JPY\n* DJI / USD\n\nWe will construct our `artificial index` from these, I will call it `ProfitGenerator`:\n\n<center>[![profitgenerator.png](https://s12.postimg.org/421peh5v1/profitgenerator.png)](https://postimg.org/image/feeaw9ejt/)</center>\n\nThis is how `ProfitGenerator` looks like, it is really a @profitgenerator, going up and up since 2009. The formula is the following:\n`BUY   Oil / USD`\n`SELL   XAU / USD`\n`SELL   USD / JPY`\n`BUY   DJI / USD`\n\nSo basically by buying the DOW 30  and Oil, and selling Gold and the USD/JPY, we get this artificial index that always makes our profits go up since 2009. Of course it has dips and volatility, but the trend line looks to go up:\n\n<center>[![trend.png](https://s13.postimg.org/7c4281afb/trend.png)](https://postimg.org/image/mktzlt43n/)</center>\n\nI have extrapolated it linearly in the future, and it could be a profitable investment.Looks like easy money to me, I might check it out as well, and look for even better hedging strategies.\n\n---------------------------\n\nBasically this is how I would trade Oil at the moment, not naked, but put inside this nice hedging strategy. So if you decide to try it out, you should reward me after you made some profits!\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n*Data sources: http://www.investing.com*\n\n***Disclaimer: The information provided on this page might be incorrect.

    "body": "I did a few of these a while back, I was experimenting with the technique.  It was fun and I might well do some more, especially if there's an audience for them\n\nThe basic technique is to first to take a video clip and split it into a number of frames.   I expect you can do this easily in Photoshop or something, but I'm a command line kind of guy so I used ffmpeg and ImageMagick  - I learned a lot from reading [this post about it](\"https://room208.org/blog/posts/48793543478.html\").  I go for things that break down into about 12-24 frames because at 24 fps you're going to need 12 to get a half second loop.\n\nThen you load up each frame in your favourite graphics editor - I use GIMP because I'm cheap.  For each frame, you create a new transparent layer and trace over the bits of the frame that you want to replicate.  There's a bit of artistic choice in here about how much detail you want to include and how much colour filling you'll do.   But the most basic thing is to create a simplified line drawing by running the brush over the key elements.\n\nSo for this one of Johnny Rotten, I only took twelve frames from the beginning and only traced his face and the mic and filled in his hair with an approximation of it's actual colour!\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmZ5i1Sv2xYzQEWccL9VZVNoo56jv6xNMUxjbjnS7V7S9A'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmZ5i1Sv2xYzQEWccL9VZVNoo56jv6xNMUxjbjnS7V7S9A'/></a><a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/Qmaxqs77D6je2acPPF8FhdghAcAV9akbkRTpGdXY4jbZKn'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/Qmaxqs77D6je2acPPF8FhdghAcAV9akbkRTpGdXY4jbZKn'/></a>\n\nIf you give your transparent layer a white background you've then got a finished frame for your clip.  So export it and give it a number so that you know which order it goes in.  Again, Photoshop and GIMP probably have this built in, but I'm awkward that way and like to make things as close to \"by hand\" as I can.  This is also much slower, but it does feel like you've made something rather than just knowing which buttons to press.\n\nYou then sew the frames back up into a GIF file using ImageMagick's convert command - check out that [blog post again](\"https://room208.org/blog/posts/48793543478.html\") for the deep dive details.\n\nAlternatively you can take a still image and just trace it several times.  That's what I did with this one of Louis Armstrong.  Four frames, each slightly different from the others, when animated give it this jiggly quality as if he is playing.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmXUay7uUTx44JaaiEEzFLoCeAqLAfxoD4cv24SWA8MkqA'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmXUay7uUTx44JaaiEEzFLoCeAqLAfxoD4cv24SWA8MkqA'/></a>\n\nI'd love to see what other people make of this technique.  Show me your work too!",

Future owners will receive dividends from transaction fees paid to BlockPay.<br>\nThe pre-ICO was done in 3 stages:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1st \u2014 exchange of OPENPOS for BLOCKPAY at the rate of 1.2 to 1 (fund of 600,000 tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>2nd \u2014 sale of BLOCKPAY at the price of 0.000288 BTC (fund of 1.4 mln tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>3rd \u2014 sale of BLOCKPAY at the price of 0.000360 BTC (fund of 3 mln tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The distribution of tokens is as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1.5% \u2014 marketing for pre-ICO</li>\n  <li>5% \u2014 pre-ICO</li>\n  <li>0.9% \u2014 early adopters</li>\n  <li>1.8% \u2014 advisors and partners</li>\n  <li>3.6% \u2014 marketing</li>\n  <li>7.2% \u2014 developers reward</li>\n  <li>80% \u2014 upcoming ICO in 2017</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The platform development plan:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The release of BlockPay \"S\" app for Android and payment terminals Odoo</li>\n  <li>BlockPay integration with leading payment terminals</li>\n  <li>API Development</li>\n  <li>The addition of a large number of fiat gateway exchanges and Escrow Services</li>\n  <li>The addition of anonymous transactions function</li>\n  <li>The development and release of the ECHO messenger for Android and iOS</li>\n  <li>Development of the first version of the BlockPay \"S\" app for iOS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project looks interesting, given the fact that they claim an integration with the ERP and CRM system<a href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\">Odoo</a> used by 60 thousand companies. The only disturbing thing is the absence of an open source software, and this spoils the whole picture. Transaction payments fee and, consequently, planned cash flow for investors are not sufficiently explained either. It should be kept in mind that this project is centralised, i.e. it belongs to the class of projects that demand trust in the founders and, correspondingly, require a thorough audit of operating activity.<br>\nCrowdsale summary:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Dates: 20 August 2016 \u2014 4 September 2016</li>\n  <li>Raised: ~ $657,000 (1096 BTC)</li>\n  <li>Tokens sold: 3.92 mln</li>\n  <li>Total number of tokens: 100 mln\u0414\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f: 20 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u2014 4 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For detailed information on the crowdsale, see: <a href=\"https://blockpay.ch/newsroom/investor-relations/blockpay-reserves/\">https://blockpay.ch/newsroom/investor-relations/blockpay-reserves/</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/BlockPay\">https://cyber.fund/system/BlockPay</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/AntShares\"><strong>AntShares</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>The project is interesting primarily due to the fact that it will be implemented using the Hyperledger platform.

Two funding campaigns start at the same time in September: the sale of Synereo Ltd shares on <a href=\"https://bnktothefuture.com/\">BnkToTheFuture</a> and of AMP tokens.<br>\nFollowing the first crowdfunding, the distribution of AMP was as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>2.72% (45.8 mln) \u2014 sold during the first crowdsale</li>\n  <li>11.9% (200 mln) \u2014 user rewards</li>\n  <li>8.92% (150 mln) \u2014 reserve for the content creators</li>\n  <li>11.9% (200 mln) \u2014 founders' reward</li>\n  <li>13.68% (230 mln) \u2014 bounty program</li>\n  <li>50.61% (850.4 mln) \u2014 next funding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Synereo revised their plans and now aim to develop a protocol similar to the <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/MaidSafeCoin\">SAFE Network</a>, which will include the following <a href=\"https://www.synereo.com/learn-more/\">components</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm</li>\n  <li>Distributed network of nodes connected on the principle of \"shards\", where blockchain is divided into many small segments</li>\n  <li>Distributed repository</li>\n  <li>Smart contracts</li>\n  <li>Social layer (a social network motivated according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/synereo/synereo.github.io/raw/master/whitepapers/synereo.pdf\">Attention</a> Economy Model)</li>\n  <li>The possibility of building distributed apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The grant program for dApps developers <a href=\"https://www.synereo.com/developers/\">Project 11</a> with a budget of 1.11 million AMP is already in operation.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The popular website <a href=\"http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/synereo/\">CoinMarketCap</a> misleadingly states current Synereo capitalisation at about $10-13 million, which is not true because it is only the cost of 62,580,000 AMP (3.72%) in circulation on the market. According to <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Synereo\">cyber \u2022 Fund</a>'s calculations, with the total of <a href=\"http://omnichest.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=39\">1.68 billion</a> tokens, Synereo's real capitalisation reaches $300 million.</p>\n<p>It has not been disclosed yet how many tokens will be put up for sale, but we can assume that the minimum amount claimed by Synereo is about $130-140 million in case the entire reserve is sold, which is 850.4 mln AMP. This is a very ambitious plan, taking into account current distribution and the market price of tokens. Besides, it should be kept in mind that after the launch of the network, additional 5% of AMP will be emitted every year. In my opinion, they should sell the whole reserve without fixed prices and with token distribution proportional to investments. It will provide normal distribution and a fair market capitalisation.</p>\n<p>Despite the presence of a strong team with an excellent technological vision, we consider the evaluation of $300 mln inadequate.</p>\n<p>Crowdsale summary:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Dates: September 2016</li>\n  <li>Total number of tokens: 1.68 billion AMP</li>\n  <li>Number of tokens for sale: unknown, probably 850.4 mln</li>\n  <li>Crowdsale goal: presumably ~ $130-140 million</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The crowdsale takes place here: <a href=\"https://www.synereo.com/sale\">https://www.synereo.com/sale</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Synereo\">https://cyber.fund/system/Synereo</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Golem\"><strong>Golem Project</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>The aim of the project is to adopt any customer personal computer for the work that is done today by servers, computing farms or supercomputers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the result, Golem Net will become a truly decentralised network where users' summarised machine power will provide any amount of hardware resources required. At the moment, there is no document explaining how exactly it would work.

Deals in the film and TV industry are the most difficult to arrange as they often involve hundreds of individual participants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u25cf On-demand video content portal (TVOD)<br>\nTVOD changes the way people watch entertainment programmes. S-DTV is born to create the TVOD portal for original content distribution, as well as for selected and acquired content. In addition to developing an interface on IPFS, S-DTV will use third-party portals such as GooglePlay, AppleTV iTunes and Vimeo to build a larger audience in a short time.</p>\n<p>Minimum investment goal \u2013 $500,000.</p>\n<p>Desirable funding \u2013 $7,5 mln.</p>\n<p>According to S-DTV documentation, Swiss company MME has developed a new, innovative organisational structure specifically for S-DTV: the Centralised Organised Distributed Company (CODE). It is the Swiss company, therefore, that will manage the finances and reinvest the income, while tokens will be used for paying out the dividends.</p>\n<p>Token distribution:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>400 mln Singular DTV GMBH</li>\n  <li>100 mln core investors</li>\n  <li>500 mln crowdsale</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Funds distribution in case if $7,5 mln is raised:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\"Singular\" season 1 (3 episodes of the mini-series): $3.25 mln</li>\n  <li>Documentary division: $0.50 mln</li>\n  <li>Development of the rights management platform: $2 mln</li>\n  <li>TVOD portal development: $1 mln</li>\n  <li>Marketing: $0.50 mln</li>\n  <li>Administrative, legal expenses and unforeseen circumstances: $0.25 mln</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crowdfunding is planned for September and will likely take place at Devcon2.</p>\n<p>The Ethereum and Consensys founder Joseph Lubin is included into the team as CTO.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in this project tokens only serve for distribution of dividends, and the project is centralised because 40% of tokens belong to Singular DTV GMBH. Another disadvantage is the fact that of the four declared founders/directors, only Zach Lebeau will work full time on the project. He is likely to be engaged in the studio rather than in the platform development; there are also risks associated with SEC.</p>\n<p>The main question is the development of the TVOD platform and the rights management platform: there is no understanding as to what kind of team will be working on it, and no technical description at the moment. If both platforms can be really implemented, the project is promising for investment.=</p>\n<p>For detailed information about the project, see: <a href=\"https://singulardtv.com/\">https://singulardtv.com/</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/SingularDTV\">https://cyber.fund/system/SingularDTV</a><br>\n</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Decent\"><strong>Decent</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>It is designed for creative people, writers, bloggers, journalists and their fans and followers.

The only reservation is that the market is not very vast, albeit actively developing. Besides, the motivation for developers and other market players is not very well thought through. In this regard, central players, who can also use smart contracts and predictions market to confirm the events results, may have an advantage. However, this project may indeed become the market leader on the condition of good community building and active incentivising of referees and the jury.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For detailed information about the project, see: <a href=\"https://firstblood.io/\">https://firstblood.io/</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/FirstBlood\">https://cyber.fund/system/FirstBlood</a><br>\n</p>\n<h2><br>\n<a href=\"https://ico.mass.network/#/\"><strong>MassNetwork</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>The three main entities:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Advertisers</li>\n  <li>Websites</li>\n  <li>Internet users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The basic principle is to follow the industry's trend to monetise customer attention and create a convenient and fair trading platform for all parties involved, including Internet users. Mass allows users to receive instant rewards for web surfing through the built-in p2p infrastructure based on the blockchain. As a result, advertisers will pay users a fair price for their attention and data without intermediaries.<br>\n</p>\n<p>An increasing number of customers are using ad-blocking software. Mass offers a browser extension and a mobile app that can block ads as well as protect personal data. Yet, their primary goal is not blocking but rather improving users' experience with advertising and rewarding them with cryptocurrency to establish a consumer-advertiser relationship and, therefore, reduce the number of ad-block users. Mass will also have a cryptocurrency wallet and blockchain-based payment system.</p>\n<p>Crowdsale dates: 6 September \u2014 1 December 2016</p>\n<p>Token distribution:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>70% to the crowdsale participants</li>\n  <li>30% to Mass team members</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mass plans to build its own full-blown infrastructure for advertising industry with an internal token. A similar solution has been already introduced to the market \u2013 the Brave browser. It blocks default ads and replaces it with incentivising ad materials. The bitcoins received from advertisers are distributed among users, the platform and the endorsing website. In my opinion, if Mass used smart contracts or a proprietary blockchain enabling further token emission to incentivise users and websites, they could compete with bitcoin. However, Mass token works on the bitcoin blockchain, which on the one hand makes it very secure, but on the other, has no advantage over bitcoin per se. In favour of bitcoin are accessibility, recognition, and a more stable price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Crowdsale takes place here: <a href=\"https://ico.mass.network/#/?aid=ep6oxa\">https://ico.mass.network/#/?aid=ep6oxa</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/MassNetwork\">https://cyber.fund/system/MassNetwork</a></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>All data and calculations are quoted as of 6 September 2016 with bitcoin price at $609.

    "body": "First things first, I want to thank the Steemit community for the response to one of the posts I mention here.   It was a nice feeling to see the voting!\n\nI do see a lot of posts in which the writer is disappointed in the feedback to their posts, especially in monetary value,   I too have felt that.  So I conducted an \"experiment\" of the \"throw it on the wall\" variety.  I took two old posts of mine from facebook, one of which I put a lot of thought into ( https://steemit.com/life/@stevescoins/defining-insanity-on-a-personal-basis ), and one which was snarky, short, and focused on booze! \nhttps://steemit.com/food/@stevescoins/recipe-1-hot-buttered-rum\n\nI did not try to compare the success rate by posting in the areas I usually post; security politics and Gridcoin.  These are both very small niche interests, and they very likely will never get a lot of response.  I do not provide value for the reading time of most people when I write in these areas.  Mental health versus booze?  THAT is a good experiment!\n\nThe recipe for Hot Buttered Rum was the clear winner, I think I reeled in a Whale within the 1st 15 minutes.  This was the second time I  made more than a  few dollars, but this was a little more than a buck by a bit!  Why is that?  Butter is good, sweet is good, rum is good.  People like those things.\n\nSo the moral?  Write and post for yourself FIRST.  I enjoyed writing both posts.  But if you want to make money from a market, you have to provide value to that market.    You don't need to spend all day baiting Whales, but an occasional attempt to identify market trends and appeal to what the voter wants is not going to kill the artiste or the prophet within you.  I said in the last paragraph that MOST folks won't read about the politics of security  or about Gridcoin?  I still write on these things, and there are some folks that come by and visit  (thank yall, btw!)\n\nAlso, consider that there is a luck of the draw.  If the person that your post has value for does not see it, new posts are taking the position for curator upvoting.  Remember that curators are rewarded on thier voting prowess, which does not necessarily mean the post was good.  Did you write a great post that nobody read?  Write a followup!\n\nFinally, there MAY be a value issue with articles that take too long to read...I don't know about that, so I'm going to shut up now '>",

    "body": "### <center>These photos were taken in July, 2016 at sunrise.</center>\n\n<center>![Sunrise at Buccaneer Bay by Meredith Loughran](https://merej99.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/bucbay1-e1473966204550.jpg)\nTaken with a Canon Powershot SX1 IS</center><br>\n# The story behind the shot\nIn July, 2016, due to a series of unfortunate events, I was faced with eviction with no immediate place to go.  \n\nWe begged and borrowed from any place we could and managed to have a little money in the bank - just not enough to save our house.  We were out of time and needed to make some hard decisions.\n\nWhat I soon found out was once residents are served eviction papers in Florida, you have 24 hours to get out of the house.  ***24 hours!***\n\nSitting between a rock and a hard place, we had secured a moving truck and a storage unit.  \n\n### We make a great team\nMy husband and I have been through so much adversity throughout our relationship.  Death in the family, job loss, the dynamics of raising kids and dealing with my poisonous ex-husband, moving, starting a business, closing the business, cars repossessed...  Pretty much anything that could test the strength of our marriage is what we went through.\n\nSometimes I think back and go: *How does this keep happening?*  What decisions are we making that keep us stuck in this terrible cycle of unfortunate events?\n\n#### We balance each other\nMy husband is high-strung where I've learned to be grounded and stable.  So the higher he goes, the lower I go.  Do you know what I mean?\n\nIf he's bouncing off the walls and completely stressed, I remain still and calm.  So if he's a skyscraper, I'm the basement foundation.  I'll let him reach for the skies but I keep him grounded and pull him back down to earth too.\n\nConversely, when I'm too low and feel like I can't take another step, he lifts me up.  He is my soul provider.  Maybe being casual friends for 20 years before we began dating has something to do with it.  There are no secrets between us, which also means we have the freedom of expression without being crucified for having opposing views sometimes.\n\n## Facing homelessness\nEven though there is a 24 hour eviction, a few benefits of living in Florida includes decent weather.  You can camp all year without fear of dying from exposure or hypothermia.  Available houses are everywhere and you can generally get into them rather quickly.\n\nAs things generally go with my husband and I, nothing happens easily.  Well...  Okay, that's not entirely true.  ***If things are meant to be, they come very easily*** but when we try to force something, it becomes impossible and we may as well be knocking our heads against a brick wall.  LOL  \n<center>![Fek it, we're Irish - from Pixabay](http://scribblingbandits.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fekit-ur-irish.jpg)\nimage source: pixabay</center>\n\n<br>\nMy husband was doing his usual pacing when I said, \"I've got an idea and I want you to hear me out.\"\n\nI had been doing some online research and found a local motel that could accommodate 3 people and pets.  Being off-season in Florida, the weekly rate was under $500.  But spending $500 meant that it was $500 less in the bank for a security deposit should we find a place to go.\n\nIt took him about an hour to say, \"Do it.\"\n\nLiterally working through the day and night to get our things off property, we got everything out but my bucket garden and potted blueberry bush.\n\n### We've got a week to find a home\nEven through all of this, I remained calm - almost peaceful.  Good things happen for us when we don't force it and the stars align.  So I just my faith out to the universe and knew that no matter what, we would work hard and we would be provided for.\n\n<center>***Sometimes you just have to put positive vibes out there and hope for a good return.***</center>\n\nBeing in the motel meant free wi-fi so we were pretty diligent about home searches.  We looked at a few properties and quickly rejected them.  Mind you, we don't look at the cosmetics of a house - stuff that can be cleaned or painted; we look at the bones of the house - water pump, electric panel, roof, walls, floor...\n\nMost of the housing we looked at didn't even have good bones or were located in seriously bad neighborhoods.  We don't require a lot but we do have our limits.\n\nOne week turned into two.  Luckily my husband is employed full time, but we were eating through our savings.  I cut costs where I could, like the food budget.  With nothing but a little microwave in the room, I kept our daily food budget down to about $10 a day to feed 3 adults.  Living conditions included one room with 2 queen-sized beds, 3 adults, 2 dogs and 4 ferrets.\n#### But it wasn't so bad!\nWe didn't have neighbors in the rooms next to us.  We had free wi-fi and access to the pool.  The cleaning ladies were polite and kept us in clean towels and toilet paper.  Most importantly, we had a roof over our head and food in our belly.\n\nI have a hard time saying we actually *were* homeless because we weren't living out of our car.  We had niceties.  But at the same time we weren't there because we were on vacation, you know?  There was no other place to go.\n\n**BONUS: Our room faced east for stunning sunrises like this.**\n\n<center>![Sunrise over Buccaneer Bay wide view by Meredith Loughran](https://merej99.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/bucbay2-e1473966000877.jpg)\nA wider view of sunrise over Buccaneer Bay</center>\n\n## And then the stars began to align\nWith 3 more days left in week two, I admit I was beginning to stress a little.  ***Ya think?!?***\nAnd then we got the call.  There's a house available as long as we can commit to a six-month lease.  And because my husband had helped them with some of their plumbing problems in the past, they were willing to stretch out the security deposit over a few of his paychecks.  **A stepping stone.**\n\nIn that time a friend of mine introduced me to #Steemit\n\nSo here we are, in a 'stepping stone' house, recovering from the last series of unfortunate events.\nCall me crazy, but I feel truly blessed.\n\n> To quote from the movie ***Bridge of Spies, 2015***\n> James Donovan: \"Do you *ever* worry?\"\n> Rudolph Abel: \"Would it help?\"\n\n### <center>Well, would it?</center>\n-----\n### Wall of #Steemit love:\nThis awesome name in peppers was created by @papa-pepper: ![@papa-pepper made my name in peppers!

Voy a comenzar con la historia de una perrita que me ha conmovido, y en mis pr\u00f3ximos post, les voy contando la historia de cada uno de los 24 perros que estamos protegiendo y alimentando gracias a steemit\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/animalrescue34001a.jpg\" alt=\"animalrescue34001a.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n\nElla es Dana una de las perras que habita en la carrera 3 de mi vecindario la he estado alimentando desde hace m\u00e1s de 2 meses, no tengo fecha exacta de cuando comenc\u00e9 pero ella fue la primera perra que me incentivo a comenzar esta labor en mi vecindario, su estado de desnutrici\u00f3n me estaba afectando.\n\nNo entiendo como hay gente que es incapaz de dejarle al menos los sobros de la comida al perro que vive en la calle, en mi cuadra hay perros de la calle y entre todos los vecinos los alimentamos con comida de sal, con los restos o incluso les dejamos un plato completo de comida, no fue necesario incluirlos a la campa\u00f1a de alimentaci\u00f3n porque los mantenemos en buena forma incluso duermen en el porche de alguna casas, se podr\u00eda decir que los adoptaron.\n\nCon Dana las cosas han sido distintas, conozco incluso al vecino que la sac\u00f3 a la calle, me cont\u00f3 que la sacaron de la casa  de una vecina en enero porque ella ya no pod\u00eda tenerla y la adoptaron, a medida que fue creciendo se enferm\u00f3 al parecer de parasitosis ya que vomitaba todo lo que com\u00eda, aparte le dio sarna. La perrita ya m\u00e1s crecidita sal\u00eda de la casa y se iba a la de los vecinos y mi vecino tuvo que irla a buscar 4 veces, hasta que se fue a otra ciudad a vivir por un tiempo y no pudo volver estar pendiente de ella.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_20160816_1803333cf0d.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160816_1803333cf0d.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n\nDana qued\u00f3 en la calle y no la trajeron m\u00e1s a su casa. El vecino dice \u201cLa perra se estaba enfermando en mi casa, hay una enfermedad en las paredes que todo perro que llega se muere, le da diarrea tres d\u00edas y muere, mi mam\u00e1 no pod\u00eda cuidarla m\u00e1s, la dejamos en la calle ah\u00ed est\u00e1 mejor y m\u00e1s sana que en mi casa\u201d he comprobado que mi vecino tiene raz\u00f3n todo perro que llega a su casa se enferma y muere si es cachorro, presumimos que en su casa habita la bacteria Parvovirus, es triste esta situaci\u00f3n pero igual no lo justifico.\n\nEsta perrita se le calcula apenas un a\u00f1o tiene una personalidad alegre y agradecida siempre que me ve me saluda con mucho cari\u00f1o mueve su cola y su amor es incomparable, puede acompa\u00f1arme por toda la urbanizaci\u00f3n cuando salgo, es una fiel compa\u00f1era, de lo que se perdieron sus due\u00f1os, es una perra muy carism\u00e1tica y tierna.. Hace 3 d\u00edas entr\u00f3 en celo por los c\u00e1lculos, este ser\u00eda su primer celo, lo preocupante es que hay varios perros que la  han montado y de tener un parto ser\u00eda muy arriesgado, por la situaci\u00f3n de enfermedad y desnutrici\u00f3n en la que est\u00e1, aparte que ser\u00eda otra camada m\u00e1s cachorros que entrar\u00edan a la situaci\u00f3n de calle.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_20160912_173902731c2.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160912_173902731c2.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n\nTodos los fondos recaudados en este post se dedicar\u00e1n a su esterilizaci\u00f3n y su tratamiento.

I will not get into details of what they did to her because it was horrifying to say the least. I closed my eyes and tears were just streaming down my cheeks. They kept saying \u201c<strong>Open your eyes and watch, because you\u2019re next</strong>\u201d. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/bw4vrm7tr/bound_and_gagged.jpg\" width=\"289\" height=\"320\"/></p>\n<p>After about twenty minutes or so, which felt like a full day to me, they threw me back into the room and I panicked. I worked feverishly on that window trying to open it. I was aware that the only way I was going to escape this horror was to jump out of that window but it had to be done without breaking it. &nbsp;If I broke the window, they\u2019d surely hear me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the dresser was an old metal comb that I used to pry the nails up. This method worked, it allowed me to loosen the nails and wiggle them back and forth until they could be pulled out by hand. Luckily there were only three nails or I would have never been able to get that window open. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I jumped out of the window and ran bare foot without looking back once. I ran through ditches along the highway, knowing that if they were out looking for me I needed to stay low. This was no easy task since I had no shoes on, but my life depended on my getting away as quickly as I could. Eventually I made my way to the road, stuck my thumb out, luckily I was picked up pretty fast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When we got into town I asked them to take me to my friend Theresa\u2019s house, I knew she would have a change of clothes and shoes for me. After changing and getting cleaned up I had no idea what I was going to do, because I knew they would be out looking for me. They obviously found Ann, and it was a matter of time before they found me again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I ended up calling an old boyfriend, Frank, and asked if he could take me to Edmonton and he agreed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A valuable lesson was learned, when parents tell you something is bad, or should be avoided, it is usually for good reason. I should have listened. When you are young, you think you know everything and will do what you want without thinking about the possible consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/7c73d0mbz/overflowing_suitcase.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"220\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I had only one small suitcase with some clothes my girlfriend gave me. Frank came and got me and we drove five hours to Edmonton. Once there I went back to the area where I knew people. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was when I met Miguel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Miguel was Portuguese and tanned and seemed like such a nice guy. I liked him instantly, I thought we would end up as great friends, but as it turned out, he ended up being my boyfriend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Miguel introduced his sister in law Doris to me. Quickly I ended up moving in with her as a roommate. Now this was already a disturbing time in my life and it wasn't about to get any better. &nbsp;&nbsp;A friendship from hell was born, and I will explain why. &nbsp;Doris was married with a child, living separate from her husband and daughter, because she could not control her hormones and had many affairs. &nbsp;She wore mostly mens clothing that were all too baggy for her. Her hair was long and blond and she stood maybe four inches taller then me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She told me the story as to why she was living away from her child. She and Miguel were at Doris\u2019s home one day, while her husband was at work. One thing led to another and the two of them ended up in bed together. Her husband, Terry, came home, and found the front door was double locked and he could not get into the apartment. She refused to let him in. Her daughter was in the crib crying with all of the commotion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/6egwz52ih/cryingbaby.jpg\" width=\"170\" height=\"136\"/></p>\n<p>Her husband went back to his car and waited in the parking lot before trying again. &nbsp;In a hurry to get out before &nbsp;Terry came back, Doris and Miguel packed up a bag, and both of them had left the apartment leaving the crying toddler behind, unattended. &nbsp;Several hours passed, and Terry figured he\u2019d try again. As soon as he reached the apartment door, he could hear his daughter wailing. He was luckily able to get into the apartment this time and he ran to pick up his sobbing daughter and carried her around looking for his wife. She was nowhere to be found.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank &nbsp;you for your support and continued reading.</p>\n<p>If you missed the beginning of my book you can find it here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/writing/@feline1991/a-steemit-original-a-lifetime-of-seeking-happiness-part-1\">https://steemit.com/writing/@feline1991/a-steemit-original-a-lifetime-of-seeking-happiness-part-1</a> &nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

What has come to my mind, it to take pictures in black-and-white option as it was in early 70-80 years when the photo has only arisen.\n\nThe place for shootings have chosen the central park. Weather was cool. Have agreed about a meeting. At first the girl hesitated, and it has turned out on a shot here so\n<center>\nhttps://pp.vk.me/c836320/v836320641/185/NYRpq9qzo9w.jpg\n</center>\n<center>\nhttps://pp.vk.me/c836320/v836320641/169/iPi41rP501o.jpg\n</center>\nAfter we have spent more than 30 minutes of shootings, the girl was liberated, and has begun to work actively.\n<center>\nhttps://pp.vk.me/c836320/v836320641/17e/eU5naYLtgEw.jpg\n<br>\nhttps://pp.vk.me/c836320/v836320641/177/XNZ-jrBAvOA.jpg\n</center>\n\nGood impressions remained with me and my model.

    "body": "<p>There's a monster lurking in the depth of those boxer shorts. One that threatens the health of several men, specially those that are undergoing that wonderful stage full of pimples, irregular beards and systematic rejection to anything that comes from their parents except money. Even if <strong>there protoadults are the population group with more risk of facing this demon, almost every male is a victim from this situation at least once in life</strong>. This enemy made of fear and lack of resolution is not the first drunkenness on vodka you got, neither that time you got caught trying to asphyxiate your personal fowl. Nothing like that.</p>\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2015/06/06/07/36/heart-799138_960_720.jpg\n<p>You're that guy, that teen around 16 years old and just got a girlfriend of around your same age. Out of nowhere, you're not the same. Your friends stop paying you a visit, you don't show up to do sports as you used to before, not to mention that you don't hang out with them in the Saturday nights. <strong>Because of her, again. Always her. </strong>Your friends get a bit mad at you and they have their reasons, but there's always a cool one that mentions: \"you just envy that he gets laid, let him copulate in peace!\". Yes, he knows, hit the nail, he totally understands the reasons why <strong>a 16 year old teen craves more the sheets than to prepare the Playstation,</strong> he spends more time with his girlfriend than with his friends. Obviously, this is an invented story, because when I was 16 I still played hide and seek and glued my snots under the table; two things I almost stopped doing by now.</p>\n<p>What your friends do not know is that <strong>you had to leave behind SEVERAL Saturday nights</strong> to reach what you were committed to, lets be sincere, at the end of the day the \"yes, I want\" from your side is obvious. But is the female whom holds the real power. <strong>They hold the goods to display in offer to our permanent demands</strong>, at least at that age (HA!). Bunch of nights of just \"making out\". Months and even years for some (that, or I had serious issues defining a situation then). Your friends could be great soccer players, but they'll never understand how it feels to make it to the goal, pass the goalkeeper, and not score because she says \"it's not the right moment\".</p>\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2016/07/21/15/41/no-1532844_960_720.jpg\n<p>In a wonderful crescendo of fantasy and metaphor, it is essential to break the dream and put a name to this Boxer short's Sauron, that guy that should not be named in the sacred halls of the bedroom is nothing but a <strong>haploid overload</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>When \"the game\" starts a lot of physiologic processes are triggered, attempting to enhance the performance</strong> in the bed / couch / car / field / airplanebathroom / bullshitairplanebathroomsaretoosmallandnobodyenjoysdoingitthere. Cardiac frequency and arterial pressure increase while at the same time <strong>blood vessels dilate</strong> (veins, mainly) at the entire genital area. This McCombo leads into <strong>blood accumulation in the sexual organs</strong> as long as the stimulation persists, because once the orgasm is reached, blood vessels recover their original size and blood drains away from the area.</p>\n<p>BUUUUUUUUUUUUT (this is what feeds the demon), when there's no orgasm and you're halfway there, <strong>the nervous signals that tell your body to \"stop and let go already\" are not there</strong> as a result blood stays there, leaving your balls literally swollen along with the always enjoyable sensation of bearing two watermelons in between your legs. We should mention that having to watermelons hanging from your hipbone hurt. Some are lucky and only hurt for a small time, others... are not so lucky (we wish you luck, dear friend).</p>\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2012/02/26/11/04/ball-17133_960_720.jpg\n<p><em>Where did the 3rd one come from?</em></p>\n<p>Despite being something amazingly frequent, <strong>we know nothing about this pain caused for not finishing what you started</strong>. There's little evidence and bibliography is very limited; only anecdotic info. Some medics had the brilliant idea of calling it <strong><em>blue balls</em></strong><strong> (slang)</strong><em>,</em> because when oxygen-less blood accumulates at the scrotum the area starts tinting into the tone of the smurfs. Some surveys were ran at professional environments and all knew the topic, yet nothing shows at medicine books. So, <strong>a clear cause is also unknown</strong>. All we have is \"knowledge\" based on basic reasoning over what we know about physiology in humans; just imagine the poor volunteer that'd go into a lab so that some white overall jerks study him by not letting him finish.</p>\n<p>Another reason for this lack of info is that <strong>the treatment is rather simple, we all know it</strong> and there's no need of highly specialized doctors to perform it... You guessed it finish what you started, solo mode; because if you don't it can be a pain that lasts hours until the blood vessels recover their original size.</p>\n<p>This time, medicine based on evidence, only real guru, confirms nothing else but folklore:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A bird in the hand is worth two in the blue.</p>\n</blockquote>\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2013/02/27/14/34/brent-goose-86582_960_720.jpg\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you liked this post and its informal way of talking about sciences, please, follow me for more!</p>\n<p>Leave a comment either for good or for bad reviews.

Its half formed little arm sensually traces the spot where a bundle of greasy black hoses passes through its skin, puffy and red all around it. \u201cI have...things...coming out of my body too.\u201d\n\nA baby\u2019s scream pierces the thick, humid air, barely discernible over a loud siren. Shattered glass cylinders all around, revealed sporadically in silhouette by flickering lights. Men in gas masks travel down the rows with hammers, smashing the cylinders that are still intact, spilling their contents into the ever-deepening soup. \n\nThe screaming suddenly stops. I search frantically for some explanation but cannot get up. My limbs, feeble imitations of what they should be, splash the foetal muck about but do nothing to move me. \n\nA maddening itching sensation surrounds the points on my chest where black hoses penetrate into it, but I haven\u2019t the fingers with which to scratch. \u201cIt\u2019s...not supposed to be this way\u201d I sputter. It looks at once quizzical and mournful. \u201cOh? How is it\u2026\u2019supposed\u2019 to be?\u201d\n\nAnother loud smash, and a baby\u2019s wail. The men with the hammers abruptly silence it, moving methodically down the rows. My tears mix freely with the amniotic fluid as one of the uniformed men, drenched in it from the waist down, arrives at our row.\n\n\u201cYou know\u201d the bulbous headed creature with the malformed little arm coos, \u201cI always thought you were pretty.\u201d It reaches over with its distorted, knobbly paw and caresses my ribcage. \u201cI would\u2019ve said something, but we were in different tanks.\u201d I recoil from his touch, shuddering as the man with the hammer finally reaches me.",

    "body": "# Making of a sculpture:\n\n Pearl The Whale.\n\nThis is something I was working on for the past week along other things, I had a lot of fun out of the process I learned a couple of things as well but overall it was something I will try again probably in the future.\n So here she comes again, the Queen of all seven seas. Isn't she a beauty?\n\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/80bc2d561d6b165be7ad8630f1f43051.png\n\n## Stage 1:\n Modeling foam, glued together or stack it with some toothpicks like I did. \nMaking my initial shape with a knife, I am keep working till I get a shape I can work with.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/falainitsastage15f666.jpg\n\n## Stage 2\n\nApplying clay over the modeling foam. The clay must be treated with water, work it out in your hands to soften it then apply it over your model, do not make it thinner than 1 mm as it will crack while it dries out.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/8912ae9b97d2bcd581aadefb82e7ea1d.jpg\n\n## Stage 3\n\nRefining and creating details, use a sharp tool to sharpen the surface of your model. Use some water to clean up your tools every now and then, it helps the most when you are working with clay to have clean and wet tools to work out.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/falainitsastage294837.jpg\n\n## Stage 4\n\nCuring process. Allow your clay model to complete dry out. It will take approximately 24 hours for this procedure to occur.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/falainitsastage35b415.jpg\n\n## Stage 5\n\nPainting your model. I used casual temperas colors, you can use acrylics or sprays. It all comes down to what you are aiming for as an end result so it is a matter of preference. Congrats your sculpture is ready it is time for some photo shooting.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/final3cab50.jpg\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/final25f3cb.jpg\n\nI hope you like the end result.\nI sure did. It now decorates a shelf on my bedroom I will call her the Ocean Pearl I was going for Marianda but she is simple not fat enough for that...\n@ned @dan @smooth @berniesanders @blocktrades @itsascam @andeverywhale out thereI hope you get a giggle out of this. I have made this as mean to go to the Amsterdam steemfest and get some of my fellows with him. Please enjoy.\n\n\nThank you all for your support\nI will include some high res photos for you to check out the final sculpture\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/c6049e3fffe58f0a25d8c9b9433fbdb1.png\n\nFollow me \n@skapaneas",

    "body": "This is a quote from Edward Snowden from his Snowden Live Q&A interview:\n\n> \"One of the most important things I think we all have a duty collectively in society to think about is when we\u2019re directed to think a certain way and accept a certain argument reflexively without actually tackling it. \n\"The common argument we have \u2014 if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear \u2014 the origins of that are literally Nazi propaganda. This is not to equate the actions of our current government to the Nazis, but that is the literal origin of that quote. It's from the Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. \n\"So when we hear modern politicians, modern people repeating that reflexively without confronting its origins, what it really stands for, I think that's harmful. \n\"And if we actually think about it, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Because privacy isn\u2019t about something to hide. Privacy is about something to protect. That\u2019s who you are. That's what you believe in. Privacy is the right to a self. Privacy is what gives you the ability to share with the world who you are on your own terms. For them to understand what you\u2019re trying to be and to protect for yourself the parts of you you\u2019re not sure about, that you\u2019re still experimenting with. \n\"If we don\u2019t have privacy, what we\u2019re losing is the ability to make mistakes, we\u2019re losing the ability to be ourselves. Privacy is the fountainhead of all other rights. Freedom of speech doesn\u2019t have a lot of meaning if you can\u2019t have a quiet space, a space within yourself, your mind, your community, your friends, your family, to decide what it is you actually want to say. \n\"Freedom of religion doesn\u2019t mean that much if you can\u2019t figure out what you actually believe without being influenced by the criticisms of outside direction and peer pressure. And it goes on and on. \n\"Privacy is baked into our language, our core concepts of government and self in every way. It\u2019s why we call it 'private property.' Without privacy you don\u2019t have anything for yourself. \n\"So when people say that to me I say back, arguing that you don\u2019t care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is like arguing that you don\u2019t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.\" \n\n\n<center> ![EdSnow](https://i.gyazo.com/e61df2c9f69db5c5c8c318fbffdcf577.jpg) </center>\n\nWatch this film. \n\n[--IJST](https://steemit.com/@imjustsayintho/)",

    "body": "# A new focus\nby @robyneggs, business strategist and artist in PDX\n___\n### The inward focus shift\nThe equilibrium of the global economy is in the not-too-distant future. The population is increasing substantially, and the largest segment of the U.S. population will retire soon. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) an economic slow-down will occur around 2020, or less than five years from now, and continue on into 2050, at which time the global economy is predicted to also triple in size (2015)! With that knowledge it must be addressed that the GDP growth of the nation will hence slow, causing businesses to look towards \u201cdeepening\u201d capital within this growth measurement (MIT, 2009). It is important to note what kind of growth is occurring, whether it be in capital, hours, or Total Factors of Production (TFP) (MIT, 2009). For, labor growth alone won\u2019t guarantee a healthy nation (Chien, 2015). To stay on top, therefore, we must \"deepen\" our nation's human capital. And steemit can help.\n### Maximizing focus\nIn order to fully maximize, or deepen output, the nation must first invest in sustainable infrastructure, human capital, and technological advances, for only long term economic strategy will increase the GDP healthfully. Steemit could cover all those bases. Steemit houses a sustainable infrastructure within its free-market governing principles; its focus is the user (or human capital in this example); and it is technologically advanced. Apparently continual growth has more to it than just increasing output. It's not about just posting *any* content, it's about posting content that adds to, or \"deepens\" the worth of steemit, as a whole. Our human capital output (in the form of posts) must sustain itself in the long run. At what point does steemit house all possible how-to articles? At what point does every household in the nation have the products it needs to live? What needs to happen to continue to grow a nation\u2019s GDP value after that? What does steemit need to do to continue to create value after the hard fork?\n### Are businesses (and you) prepared?\nConsidering the economy will soon reach equilibrium, how prepared are we for such an event? Consider that the free market of businesses might only be concerned with the short term effects of economic growth and shock, but what controls will be instituted to carry on efforts when said businesses mature or no longer exist? What about when steemit matures? Continual increased output will simply not be enough, considering the explosion in population growth by 2050. According to Peter Diamandis, a speaker at TED2012, this explosion brings with it an age of abundance; one in which we can expect to see 3 billion new minds (minute 12:07) coming online in the near future. Capital deepening must become the new focus of growth measurement, to guarantee that output per worker increases; that we increase our value as the individual. It is up to us to deepen ourselves and our investments, steemit being the possible infrastructure of deliverance.\n![safe4a451.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/17/safe4a451.png)\n### Adapting and policy\nNew economic policy must therefore become endogenous. \n> What is the 'Endogenous Growth Theory'\nThe endogenous growth theory is an economic theory which argues that economic growth is generated from within a system as a direct result of internal processes. More specifically, the theory notes that the enhancement of a nation's human capital will lead to economic growth by means of the development of new forms of technology and efficient and effective means of production. -Investopedia\n\nNew, long term evidence has shed light on the effects of internal and external shocks to this nation, and globally over many decades. And while exogenous growth models can be applied to technological shocks, endogenous growth explains why those shocks inevitably deepen the capital of the labor force. \n\nTechnology allows for more output per worker than ever before; labor increases using the same amount of hours. Not just technology can grow the economy but the TFP (total factors of production) can as well, like the skills and abilities of trained and talented human capital. Labor deepening exists within steemit as people's abilities and skills heighten. This is because we continuously improve, to stay at the top of the free-market demand apex.\n### An investment\nInvesting in human resources, new technology, and sustainable infrastructure (that said transactions occur over), is the new focus of growth measurement in the economy. Focusing on endogenous measurements of growth rather than exogenous is what is necessary in the long-term. And steemit can accommodate that. How will government policy solve the economic problem of capital per worker decrease due to the large amount of population that will turn 60 between 2020 and 2050 (Kim & Hewings, 2013)? How will it address the new market of 3 billion new internet users? How will it deal with a long term economic slow-down as a result? Much less, how will it transcend the predicted financial crash of the U.S. dollar (as [outlined](https://steemit.com/steem/@thelord/steemit-and-the-us-economic-collapse-of-september-27-2016) by @thelord)? The separation between government policy and private sector economic business strategy lies in the training and investment of human capital, aka the education system, aka steemit.\n### No government control and the resulting education\nWithout government control, the private sector would need to establish their own education systems, to prepare children to enter the workforce. How would businesses even begin to do that? What types of people would a business choose? What business would the parents choose to educate their children? And would having non-standardized education increase the GDP, or would it weaken it? Steemit, through its free-market allocation of wealth, would drive children and parents to educate themselves, in the most needed fields. The focus would become bent on finding a need and filling it.\n### Deepening brings salvation\nThese situations can only be measured in endogenous growth. Government economic policy aka steemit can serve to motivate or enhance this growth in human capital, in a way that businesses may fail at - by providing a free-market demand for education across the globe, by maintaining the infrastructure already in use to house this education, and by employing retirees that wish to continue to contribute to the workforce. Breaking down current government policy, however, is still a must. It needs to be rebuilt efficiently, utilizing new technology, to maximize its effect on the GDP. It needs to question what will be done in regards to the slow-down. Surely, if it adapted steemit, it would lose control in planning for and protecting the future health of the economy. But this control would simply be replaced with free-market principles, as opposed to the current capitalist structure. A free-market application to long-term economic strategy is the steemit solution, and the one that could save us all.\n![steemlifelogo83c22.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/steemlifelogo83c22.png)\n### References:\n1.

    "body": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VuVQsID.jpg\"/>\nI like talking about hijacked words.   Usually the hijacking occurs due to actions of some alphabet agency of the government, or a large corporate agenda.    Today is slightly different.    The word I am going to focus on today is ***Organic***.      By focusing on this word I am not endorsing GMO vs Organic debate that occurs, though I was on the side lines of a very amusing debate of that type today.   All of my friends bickering back and forth in our Politics, Religion, and BS channel.  :)    The idea of Organic as a label being misused came up.    I realized \"*Hey, there is another great example of a hijacked word*.\"\n\n<h1>What do I mean by hijacking?</h1>\nBefore we tackle today's word I want to first explain what I mean by hijacking.    This is my description of when there is a concerted effort to use a word that can illicit an emotional response in some way that is not actually accurate based upon it's definition.     Past words I have discussed are <a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-the-study-based-battle-for-control-of-our-minds\">[Terrorist, Piracy]</a>, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/politics/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-2-0-just-who-is-a-traitor-what-is-treason\">[Traitor]</a>, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-3-0-anarchy-climate-change-occult-conspiracy-theory\">[Anarchy, Climate Change, Occult, and Conspiracy Theory]</a>.   In those cases I explained some possible motives for the hijacking in the <a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-the-study-based-battle-for-control-of-our-minds\">first word hijacking</a> post.    Those motives don't seem to apply completely in the case of the words today.   If they do I may simply have not identified how yet.\n\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/DJHLI7Bfi1Vpm/giphy.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>Organic</h1>\nThe first thing I like to do generally when going over the hijacking of words is to find a definition for the word from before it was hijacked.   This is important for eventually the dictionaries do update and include new definitions for the words.   This is partially due to lingual drift.\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/iS0xCfP.png\"/>\nThat is closest to the original definition I can find.   The Meriam/Webster Dictionaries have already incorporated all the new definitions as tied to the organic vs GMO food movements.   I will show those here for completeness.\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ySHBg1c.png\"/>\n\nI have friends that are not opposed to healthy living, but are rightly opposed to the term organic, and often to the term GMO.    They do have good reasons for being opposed to it.   The things they are used to back up or strengthen often would result in the statement being naive, or hypocritical.   I will explain that fully here in just a moment.\n\n***Organic*** technically is defined as \"*of, relating to, or derived from living matter*\" as an adjective.    That is pretty simple.\n\nShort of a few minerals like salt, and water that defines pretty much EVERYTHING we ingest.    It also defines viruses, parasites, symbiotes, you, and I.\n\nIn fact, if our food is not organic then we cannot subsist on it.   We will die very quickly without ingesting organic materials that our body can break down.   Technically, this means that all FOOD is organic.\n\n*Again in case you missed it.   This blog post is not to side with anyone on the GMO vs Organic food debate.   It is purely to illustrate that these are in fact hijacked words/terms*.\n\nSo how is this word hijacked?   We require organic sustenance.   By implying something is organic and something else is not we immediately setup a state where one should not be eaten.    Yet the truth of the matter is that HOW something is acquired does not change whether it is organic or not.    It either is organic or it is not.    If it is not then other than a few minerals and water we can't survive or ingest such things.    So it has been hijacked to extend meaning and paint a picture in our minds that is in fact false in intention.\n\nIf the argument were Natural Foods vs Manufactured Foods then there might be a little bit more sincerity there and it would be closer to actual meaning.    The term organic when used in these arguments is a very \"loaded\" word.\n\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnK80JHV0fgDZzG/giphy.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>GMO</h1>\nThis acronym stands for Genetically Modified Organism.    The use of it is usually derogatory and is used to indicate something was modified by careful manipulation in a lab.   It happened by chemical manipulation, injection, cell splicing, etc.     Yet in reality we have been doing this throughout human history.   The difference today is we've created methods where we can do this very rapidly rather than the long tedious process of the past.   So when people use the term GMO they technically are using it for the fast lab created method.    Oh and it is important that the word ORGANISM is a noun version of Organic.    So GMOs are organic, it is part of their name.\n\nIn history we have bred animals.\n\nWe have bred plants.\n\nThese are all genetic modification with us giving evolution a push by setting up certain environmental conditions and opportunities.    They still are occurring due to human intervention.\n\nFor plants it is likely we wouldn't have CORN as a crop without such activities.    We also might not have any bananas left without such activities.\n\n<b>Popped Secret: The Mysterious Origin of Corn</b>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBuYUb_mFXA\n\n<b>The surprising history of bananas in under 2 minutes</b>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpAHPXNhAwk\n\n<b>And Man Created Dog</b>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFzbBVMR8zA\n\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/98pZs1ZVaWb1C/giphy.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>Troll</h1>\nI am not actually sure why we settled on the word Troll to describe people that intentionally seek to antagonize others and gain pleasure from it.    In the early days of the internet we called them **Flamers** and the actions they were involved in **flame wars**.    Troll and trolling replaced these terms.\n\nWe also came up with phrases such as \"*Don't feed the troll*.\"\n\nSo this word was repurposed from its original meaning.   It was hijacked.    Yet this does not match what I normally would write about in terms of hijacking.     At least yet.\n\nWhen people are not intentionally antagonizing and are instead arguing and perhaps in the throes of cognitive dissonance they are NOT trolling.     A troll is not someone who disagrees with you and gets passionate about the subject.\n\nSo how it is hijacked is when someone chooses to use the term ***Troll***  to describe someone who disagrees with them.\n\n<img src=\"https://media0.giphy.com/media/3oEduGzkdvam26MrXG/200w.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>Hijacking</h1>\nNo one has called me out on it yet, so I thought I would call myself out.   I have hijacked the word hijacked for the emotional imagery I hope it places in people's mind.   I want them to be outraged at groups seeking to emotionally manipulate you into making a larger emotional relation to an action than you would normally have.\n\nI am a hypocrite here.   I acknowledge that I am doing this intentionally.   I want people to care about people altering their words for political and economic agendas.    I want people to start thinking people using words to define something that they actually are not.    It is essentially taking a metaphor and instead of treating it like a metaphor we now instead use it as the actual definition.\n\nA definition for this that would not use the word hijacking would be, redefining, repurposing, or changing.    Yet I do not think those have quite the FUN and emotional impact of hijacking.   Hijacking is seen as something hostile and aggressive.    Much like the word Piracy for copying something digital is nothing like what piracy actually meant.\n\nI hope you got something out of this edition of the word hijacking series.   At the very least maybe something to think about or enjoyment.   Thank you for your time.",

I warn you, I'm not an artist and my creation do not pretend to be an art. just something came over me.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/9b/OCNpU4gQRx0.jpg\" width=\"602\" height=\"389\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/94/EzJAJcbbqcE.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"414\"/></p>\n<p>So what do you think?</p>\n<p>Now, lets return to my basilicum. I decided to plant purple basil at home because:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;1. I love to see how plants are growing;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. I like the taste and flawour of basil;</p>\n<p>3. basil is not only a delicious condiment, it has so many more useful properties;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. growing basil at home is cheaper than buying it in a supermarket in winter;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. basil just looks beautiful.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/ac/26h6wvaCyKE.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/b3/9PkkuC3hnNE.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"/></p>\n<p>this photos were made by me 2 years ago in my garden.</p>\n<p>I want to note that basil &nbsp;leaves contains a large number of the important minerals and vitamins (A, B, P, C, etc.), various amino acids, essential oils. &nbsp;It`s a wonderful immune system stimulator, improves memory, lowers cholesterol in the blood, if you are suffering from insomnia, then there will help basil, as it has a calming effect on the nervous system.</p>\n<p>And specialy for girls, basil is an excellent antioxidant. Eat basil regularly, and your skin will always stay beautiful and healthy, the same thing will be with your hair.</p>\n<p>If you want to stay beautiful and healthy as long as possible, then eat as much basil as possible, it will slow down the aging process and prolong youth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Now, a simple plan, how to plant basil:</p>\n<p>you'll need: soil, flower pot, spoon (or something like that), water, seeds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/ba/uFpyFu5zp0I.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"259\"/>&nbsp; <img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/c1/PzwWU0v31HI.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"259\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/c8/7fKXPqtl0Mc.jpg\" width=\"325\" height=\"259\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/32/mhEkv77lnO8.jpg\" width=\"272\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>put soil in to the flower pot</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/47/xLfbxm1Uo5w.jpg\" width=\"366\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;tamp the soil with spoon&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/4e/KUGmIripXzs.jpg\" width=\"461\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;pour the ground and make holes of 1.5-2 cm deep in it&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/55/GBsJg9nsoTY.jpg\" width=\"461\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>I did it with the spoon</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/5c/VOOIptBr2aQ.jpg\" width=\"461\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>put the seeds in to the soil</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/63/MgcHM4ifZ8I.jpg\" width=\"413\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/71/LCC4d_P_PuM.jpg\" width=\"385\" height=\"372\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;close the holes with the soil</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/78/dsBEWxUSKGM.jpg\" width=\"414\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>put the flowerpot on the sunny window</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/86/G8xTEIi0Y3I.jpg\" width=\"461\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Now let's see what will happen with my magical flower pot.

    "body": "<html>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good afternoon Steemit, I am officially done breast feeding and am ready to get rid of the last few pounds that are still hanging on from my pregnancy so I have been trying out different ways to cut calories from my diet without loosing flavor. Spaghetti squash is a great substitute for pasta or in this case rice. Spaghetti squash has about 40 calories per cup while rice has upwards of 200. It also has fiber, potassium and vitamins A and C. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For chicken:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1lb chicken breast</li>\n  <li>1 tsp ancho chili</li>\n  <li>1 tbs olive oil</li>\n  <li>1 lime (juice and zest)</li>\n  <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For squash:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1 spaghetti squash (cut in half length wise and seeds removed)</li>\n  <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>\n  <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preheat oven to 425F. &nbsp;In a baking dish, sprinkle chicken with ancho chili. &nbsp;Mix together oil, lime zest and juice and garlic. &nbsp;Pour mixture over chicken. &nbsp;Drizzle olive oil over squash and season with salt and pepper. &nbsp;Place cut side down on baking sheet. &nbsp;Bake a together for 30 min. &nbsp;Shred squash with a fork and put in the bottom of bowls. &nbsp;Shred chicken with forks and put on top of squash. &nbsp;I added cheese, salsa and guacamole to ours but you can top with anything you like. &nbsp;Enjoy!</p>\n<p>https://puu.sh/rcmnK/c059def2e0.png</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "What is Gridcoin?\n\n>Gridcoin (Ticker: GRC) is a decentralized, open source math-based digital asset (cryptocurrency). It performs transactions peer-to-peer cryptographically without the need for a central issuing authority. \nhttp://www.gridcoin.us/\n>BOINC is an open-source volunteer oriented computing grid that combines the processing power of all individual users for the purposes of scientific research. It's free, and harnesses the unused clock cycles from processors and graphics cards to attempt to cure cancer/aids/ebola/malaria, map the milkyway, crack enigma codes, etc.. \n\n\nWhen I first started mining GRC, community members provided me with enough GRC to start staking  (I'm not going to explain it here, but part of GRC mining involves Proof of Stake).    I have researched the coin to my own understanding (not expert), including some past hiccups, and I work primarily on GRC now.  I think there is potential in mining the coin, and that even if the investment fails to meet the potential, the mining itself has accomplished something for science.\n\nTo help that potential bloom, I am hoping to encourage some newcomers to Gridcoin mining by offering a staking balance of 100 GRC to the first 5 posters that create a wallet (or have started in the last couple of days) and post a receiving address on this blog.\n\nI found the community to be very helpful in answering newcomers' questions.\nhttps://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net:6667/#gridcoin\nhttps://cryptocointalk.com/forum/232-cryptocoin-forums/\n\nI am not the best one to ask for tech help, though.  Just sayin!\n\nGood mining!\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.imgur.com/hPY1Osp.png",

    "body": "http://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/0/3/IMAG03431j_6525197_23304303.jpg\nFans of extreme adventures will surely like my next article, which will be devoted to excursions to the salt mines of Soledar!\nWe began our tour of the salt mine with the instruction, basically it all comes down to the fact that not to touch anything in the wrong place not to go and to follow all the instructions of our guide. I think everyone knows that without a helmet in a mine is impossible, and therefore it is here also attached.\n\nAfter that our tour group in a special \"Elevator\" which in the language of miners, called the cage, was lowered into the mine. Just imagine the crate for fifteen minutes down to a depth of 300 m. So that impressions from the descent will definitely last a lifetime.\n\nI must say that the temperature in the mine is kept at 14\u00b0C to 16\u00b0C. Therefore, if you decide to visit in the summer \u2013 dress warmly in cold season temperature very comfortable.\n\nSalt mines of Soledar has formed in the Ancient oceans. So only here you have a unique opportunity to walk on its bottom.\n\nMine are all made of salt, walls, and floors. And in order to check, you can always try the taste. \nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/2/2/IMAG0362jp_9184718_23304322.jpg\nDue to the ions of salt, which it contains, even in the air in a salt mine the cleanest conditions, even much sterile as an surgical room. The usual guided tour, which lasts one and a half hours, replaces the 15 inhalation procedures and guarantees that at least two and a half months you will not get sick.\n\nSo, after the descent, we took salt corridors, featuring a variety of unique exhibits. Will not describe in detail all tell me about the most interesting of them.\n\nSo, for example, very much of the famous Donetsk palm made of salt.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/2/9/IMAG0354jp_9421794_23304329.jpg\nImagine here at a depth of 300 m is even a chapel. The thing is that in the past the miners spent so many time in the mine, that they had done a Holy place. Here you can free to light a candle for the health.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/4/8/IMAG0365jp_3366678_23304348.jpg\nAnd mine is an exhibition of paintings by local artists which are available for purchase.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/6/6/IMAG0375jp_4203456_23304366.jpg\nDid you know that salt is not only white, but red. Red salt is generally a very rare mineral, it occurs once in 30 years. In a salt mine is an artificial stone red salt, they say it grants wishes. So, do not miss your chance .\n\nAt the end of the tour, our waited main exhibit salt mine is a huge hall. Just imagine its height is 28 metres is a 9-storey building and a width of 17 meters.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/8/2/IMAG0406jp_5860409_23304382.jpg\nOften hosts various concerts, shows and so on.\nAnd on New year every year is a huge tree, which is accompanied by a Christmas matinees for children and Christmas show for adults. The holidays last from December 15 to January 15.\n\nIn the salt room is a football field where everyone can play football. And for those who don't care about soccer, here is a small movie theater where we watched a film about the history of the salt mine. Also in the local mini-caf\u00e9 you can buy coffee, tea and sweets. It will be a good addition to the movie.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/4/1/5/IMAG0408jp_4233814_23304415.jpg\nAfter that we went back to the crate and went upstairs. Be sure to find a small crystal of salt, it will be a wonderful reminder of such a special tour!\n\nIf the souvenir could not be found, you will be able to buy it. This mine is located near the place of sale. From best-selling variety , suggest, purchase salt lamp. Just keep in mind that for best results, the lamp must be made from a solid piece of salt.\n\n\nTour to salt mines of Soledar is an unforgettable, extreme, and most importantly very good for your health!",

I hate to break it to you, but digital currency IS indeed \"<em>one more step towards the mark of the beast</em>\" - <em>and we all know it.&nbsp;</em></h3>\n<p>Let's just get that out of the way now. But fear not, this is NOT a<em> paranoid religious</em> post warning people about the eternal dangers of joining Steemit, nor of using digital currency in general however. This is just a hopefully<em> rational religious</em> post (inspired by <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/4-reasons-why-your-nation-will-kill-cash-for-a-digital-currency\">a secular article</a>) meant to<em> stem paranoid fear</em> (amongst Christians mainly) of utilizing Steemit specifically, and digital currency in general.&nbsp;Which I will get back to in just a second...</p>\n<p>But first... If to you, \"stemming this fear\" makes me \"part of the Satanic conspiracy\" then I can't help that, and I won't engage with or reply to you if that is your view (which you are entitled to hold, and even to express as a comment below).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'd rather use my time to inform non-Christian people who may have clicked in here (for laughs perhaps?)&nbsp;that Yes, I believe that the mark of the beast is coming, and you DO need to aware of the dangers of accepting it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x395/14358900_10154412654816605_8330352735442203600_n.jpg?oh=e2a53091d31ad716798686aec3f7bef0&amp;oe=586CF056\" width=\"305\" height=\"395\"/><br>\nImage Source &amp; External Article: http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/markbeast.htm</p>\n<p>&nbsp;(Hence the external articles links being detailed here for further reading - which I have not closely vetted btw, they just had top matches for images)...</p>\n<h3>Anyways...</h3>\n<h3>As I told my friend Don (who DID join Steemit @roswellrockman ) \"So is your debit card!\"</h3>\n<p><strong>Putting Don and I's end-of-conversation succinctly, there are many aspects of our everyday lives that have brought and are bringing us \"one step closer\" to the mark of the beast - but they are not in themselves the mark, they are not evil, and (imho) they are not to be feared, or shunned.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>(Altho I will note respectfully that The American Amish community feels differently - see the link below these next images.)</p>\n<h3>There are indeed many examples from our now-everyday lives that could easily be said to be bringing us \"one step closer\" ... such as the \"Bar Codes\" on every product we purchase</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/wmb2.jpg\"/><br>\n... especially if the same types of \"scanners\" that read them, were then pointed to a laser tattoo or RFID chip in your hand, to receive payment for these goods at the register.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/wmb3.jpg\"/><img src=\"http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/wmb4.jpg\"/><br>\nAll 3 Images above &amp; External Article: http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index1392.htm</p>\n<p>\"Radio Frequency ID chips\" (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification\">Wikipedia article</a>) are already being used (some will say \"being tested\") to help pet owners keep track of their pets.

And especially \"hi-tech\" firms demanding secrecy and security clearances even use them on employees!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Could Big Brother and The Rothchild's and The Federal Reserve Banks and The U.N. (collectively, \"The New World Order\") one day very soon use all of this to both track you physically, and to observe or control your money supply?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Absolutely!</p>\n<p>It's no stretch at all to imagine combining RFID technology with UPC Bar Codes - and then connecting it all to your bank account via the Internet (or the Blockchain!) - to fulfill the Bible prophecy about the mark of the beast happening in the near future, or in our lifetimes.</p>\n<p>Folks I am no stranger to this belief. I first penned the words myself way back in 1997 (in my original webpage and book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Ueug63\"><strong>\"Come Sail Away : UFO Phenomenon &amp; The Bible\"</strong></a>- &lt;&lt; Amazon link to 2105 version) in the section I titled \"Genesis 6 to 666\"</p>\n<p><strong>\"To understand how the world\u2019s entire economy could be tied into a mark on one\u2019s flesh would be a completely unimaginable miracle - a near impossibility - inconceivable to most Christians throughout the ages. This has left some events of the book of Revelation a little hard to piece together into a believable probability, much less an immediate future.</strong><br>\n<br>\n\"<strong>In order to accomplish such an incredible thing, you\u2019d have to have some way to access a person\u2019s bank account from anywhere in the known world; all financial institutions would have to have some way of talking to each other through some sort of, of, machinated \"net,\" or a \"web,\" or something; you\u2019d have to come up with some sort of mark, or magnetic strip, or some \"barred code\" that some futuristic \"scanner\" could read; surgical or laser-tattoo technology capable of implanting it, and a \"personal secret code\" so that no one could ever rob you in this \"cashless society.\" Any-time machinery, for financial transactions, would have to be everywhere. Everyone would have to be assigned a separate number at birth. These \"scanner devices\" would have to be in every grocery, hardware, department and convenience store, and every product would have to be marked with this computerized bar-code\u2026</strong><br>\n<br>\n\"<strong>Yup, you\u2019d need all that\u2026</strong><br>\n<br>\n\"<strong>Get that in place and you\u2019re ready to go...\"&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.alienstranger.com/seekye1//CSAcover.jpg\"/><br>\n(Original 1997 cover, now out of print - <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Ueug63\">2015 version available on Amazon here</a>)</p>\n<h3>So getting to my main point - finally...</h3>\n<p>YES. All kinds of technological advances from the past 30 years and more could and probably WILL - imho - be used to make the Mark of the Beast possible... call me a paranoid religious nut if you like, I do firmly believe that such is coming.</p>\n<p>The Internet itself, for example, connects and brings the whole world online. But if you're using it to read this, now, you are perhaps already hooked, and have no room to talk about Steem or digital currencies being the pre-cursors to the mark of the beast.

Bar Code technology in grocery stores that you apparently don't have the religious conviction to oppose not abstain from ... retinal scanners, or fingerprint security features in your smartphone...</p>\n<p>See what I mean?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are not a practicing Amish person - or you use only \"true money\" (Gold and Silver) to barter and to trade for goods and services when you need them (or farm and grow your own food, to ensure that you don't) - then there are already DOZENS of aspects of your everyday life that you have accepted and routinely utilize that have already in fact brought YOU \"one step closer to the mark of the beast.\"</p>\n<p>YES - these \"new-fangled concepts\" like Steem Dollars, Bitcoin, and Digital Currencies are perhaps OBVIOUS steps moving us all FURTHER along that path to one-world government under antichrist...</p>\n<p>(<em><strong>EXCEPT IT MUST BE NOTED</strong></em> in this article for you newbies to the concept, that TO-DATE, popular digital currencies (Steem, Bitcoin, Etherium, etc, etc) are actually intended AND ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED to help users MOVE AWAY from immoral government spying networks, and away from evil centralized banking platforms, putting \"the power in the hands of the people\" - for awhile at least.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So technically, by joining Steemit and adopting Steem as currency, you are fighting the underpinings of the Satanic One-World government that is forming all around us. You are actually, literally, restraining The Beast from his march to power! For awhile anyways...</p>\n<p>So there.) &nbsp;</p>\n<p>But yes, I would affirm that some form of digital currency in general could and possibly will be used by the evil-antichrist-oneworldgovernment-rothschilds-federalreserve-warmongeringtotalitarian New World Order yet to arise under the real antichrist when he appears.</p>\n<p>In fact, it was seeing this article today published by The Coin Telegraph&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/images/725_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8zYjkxMjBiMjg3YTRmZDJjZjE5MTcyZDk0ZDBhOGQzOC5qcGc=.jpg\" width=\"725\" height=\"483\"/><br>\n<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/4-reasons-why-your-nation-will-kill-cash-for-a-digital-currency\"><strong>4 Reasons Why Your Nation Will Kill Cash For A Digital Currency</strong></a></p>\n<p>that inspired me to drop everything and write this particular article.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Coin Telegraph wonderfully details how national interests (Satanic, New World Order interests, for our purposes here) <em>probably will in fact adopt a digital currency of their own</em> in the coming years. I can totally see THEIR VERSION of a global digital currency exchange being the near-final step in implementing the true Mark of the Beast, when (but not until) The Antichrist is revealed.</p>\n<p>But Steem/Steemit just isn't it. Today's free market digital currencies - if anything - are the \"gum in the works - fly in the ointment - monkey wrench in the machine\" to the eventual true Mark of the Beast, now that I think about it. Today's digital currencies actually serve to free us from the system that is now in place, by providing de-centralized mediums of currency (barter, exchange, etc) that serve as powerful alternatives to current banking structures, and chains.</p>\n<p>Governmental agencies (NWO ones or not) are actually in a scramble currently to figure out HOW to regulate, tax, and ultimately control the existing currencies. But neither they - not the devil - are behind them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So my position is to say that unless you're either willing to become Amish today and forego ALL of the technologies I've detailed here (and electricity) then you've really nothing to fear from becoming an early adopter of Steem/Steemit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Bible clearly instructs and solemnly warns all to not accept the Mark of the Beast, <em><strong>when it finally comes</strong></em> in the form of <em><strong>a mark on your hand or forehead that cannot buy or sell without</strong></em> receiving. Abstaining from \"the steps\" has proven impractical, unavoidable (again, except to the Amish), and ultimately not directly commanded in scripture.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n===============<br>\nTwo things in closing:<br>\n#1) Here's one more lengthy scripture-packed article on <a href=\"http://www.av1611.org/666/biochip.html\"><strong>Biochips &amp; TMOTB</strong></a> I'll recommend if you're unlearned about the whole topic...<br>\n#2) You may have noticed in this article that I'm an author in Roswell who deals with the topics of Aliens, UFOs, and The Bible.

Having over worked muscles or your posture compromised causes a lot of kinks and knots in our body.  Having deep tissue massage is great for alleviating pain. \n\n\n<h4>The benefits of have a deep tissue massage: </h4>\n* Increases blow flow in the body which causes healing to improve\n* Reduces inflammation\n* Loosen tight muscles cluster\n* Improve overall blood pressure \n* Breaks up scar tissue\n* Stress reliever. \n\n90 percent of the people who read this knows that massages are great. I'm an anomaly, I am not a fan of massages but I do believe in the benefits.  I do help out the family when I was younger when they asked for massages and I have a natural talent for it. They were confused and would ask how did I know what to do to fix their back. it still remains a mystery til this day. There are many reason why people can't get massages because of the inconvenience, money, or unavailability which brings me to...\n\n<center> <h3>Lacrosse ball</h3>\n![](http://d2ydh70d4b5xgv.cloudfront.net/images/7/7/mobilitas-mobility-peanut-the-original-double-lacrosse-ball-and-myofascial-1a1f82b10a664b959539aacdbdcf0a96.jpg)\n[Peanut Lacrosse ball](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0140NJXY6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0140NJXY6&linkCode=as2&tag=lasted-20&linkId=1edab9bdbe3612327d257f4edd57cfb5)\n</center>\nThis improve many of my family's lives when they started using it. My mother, dad, brother, and uncles all are a huge fan of these. The idea of lacrosse ball is to place it either on a wall and lean into or placed on the ground and lay on top of it to target stubborn pains and aches caused by tight muscles. It is used by many athletes but also adored by people that hate the idea of working out. The purpose (for example) is to place it somewhere on your back where it is the most uncomfortable and leave it there for around 20 - 30 seconds so that your muscle in that area would slowly release itself.  What I personally do is to put 2 of these under my desk roll my feet with them. \n<center> <h3>Foam roller</h3>\n![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VxfEt9NtL._SL1500_.jpg)\n[Foam Roller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KAEJ3V8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00KAEJ3V8&linkCode=as2&tag=lasted-20&linkId=08ef65112539bb10114ba72a89ab1edd)</center>\nThey are great for the overall body. Less intense as the lacrosse ball but they can improve your posture as you roll on top. Here you also do the same thing as the lacrosse ball you lay on top of it and find a tender spot and hold it there for around 20 - 30 seconds if you can and move to the next spot. I don't advise rolling the lower back since your spine is already curve in and your creating more of a sway back. This improve circulation on your thighs, side torso, chest, or any part of your body that can rest on top of this.\n\n<center> <h3>Theracane</h3>\n![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31VpBRHxbUL.jpg)\n[Theracane](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PRMCJU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000PRMCJU&linkCode=as2&tag=lasted-20&linkId=e0fcdc173eac78ceda3dccef5b82dcaf)\n</center>\n\nThis is the first thing I purchased when I had tense shoulders because I had a laptop bag which was a sling style bag. The uneven weight distribution caused intense pain and knots in my shoulder which I had no way of stretching it out. During that time I was a student living in the dorms. No car, not a lot of money,  and it was super inconvenient to travel one hour to see a physical therapist for a massage. This was introduced to me by my brother who has knots majority of his life because he had bad posture. I gave it a go and it worked! This is great for people who are in a chair and can't just lay down on the floor suddenly like in an office setting. This can be used when reading something on your computer or anything that doesn't requires hands you can start using this to help reduce the pain on your shoulder and neck. \n\nThese three products I always use if I feel that my muscles are tight or overworked that particular day. They are always in hands reach and has improved my over knot issues. Have a great day Steemit, hope this helps!",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0104.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>My entire life, I knew however things shook out, I\u2019d eventually be making comic books as a career. At 36, I\u2019m later to the party than I originally anticipated, but I\u2019ve had three decades to prepare for this! I remember as a kid, just being enamored with comic book art [\u2026and still am]. For years, I\u2019d draw these snake characters during class with my friend Neal. Just page after endless page of snakes killing each other. The kind of gratuitous fantasy violence that defines weirdos in high school.</p>\n<p>Eventually, photography took over my life, but I still read comics, thought about comics and drew comics when I managed to make time. A couple years ago I began stringing together a story for a comic called THEIA. A sci-fi conspiracy story rooted in the real world, based on actual science. I learned how to format full script for comics and graphic novels [\u2026you can read the finished <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">THEIA</a> script in my previous blog, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/writing/@kommienezuspadt/full-script-of-theia-sci-fi-comic-book-theia-exclusively-on-steemit\">\u201cFull script of THEIA sci-fi comic book! Exclusively on Steemit!\u201d</a>]. This was a big divergence than my hack and slash snake comics with Neal [\u2026who\u2019s stories progressed with each turn of the page, like a Miyazaki film, but really horrible].</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0105.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1132\"/></p>\n<p>It was during the process of writing the first draft for <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">THEIA</a> that I realized all these years I\u2019ve been so drawn to comics, the real allure for me was story telling and character creation, even more than great art. I\u2019ve been creating comics my entire life, and thus, creating characters along the way. Once I began disciplining myself with taking writing more seriously, I discovered other helpful tools to aide in the creation process. I began taking &nbsp;inventories, outlining in depth documentation of each characters lives, affiliations and personalities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Character profiles are something I\u2019ve done for 20 years. I mimicked my favorite fantasy artists like Gerald Brom, Boris Vallejo and the one and only, Frank Frazetta. I\u2019d seen pencil sketches of their concept designs with monsters, heroes and heroines, and just did my best to emulate them. I used to draw the typical front, side, three-quarter and head sketches as a reference bible [\u2026granted, much easier when it was just snakes].</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0106.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"519\"/></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been enjoying a renaissance of creativity since committing to doing comics full time, and character creation is where I spend most of my time. THEIA is still my priority as I have an active <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">Patreon</a> campaign and those pledging support are doing so for that particular title. I do, however, have two other stories I\u2019m developing which are currently knee deep in the character creation process. A Bukowski-esk pulp crime genre during the late 80\u2019s following a private investigator throughout his struggle with sobriety in Queens, NY.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SketchUpdate004.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1130\"/></p>\n<p>The other is a dark ghost story taking place in the mid-1800\u2019s, surrounding a recently deceased, troubled soul that finds himself caught between the realm of the living, and the afterlife; unable to pass for fear of judgement after a life of heinous acts. The characters in this story were inspired by my most interesting friends, and obscure tales of macabre lore during the industrial revolution and the Southwestern US history.</p>\n<p>I wish I was further along in my pursuit of story telling, world building and character creation. I wish I had decades of experience to share here on Steemit. I don\u2019t want to come across like I\u2019m the authority on these complex, disciplined skills; I\u2019ve only been seriously absorbing the art for a couple of years. I imagine, however, there are quite a few new writers, artists and creators here, navigating their own discoveries and process. With that in mind, [and in the spirit of all the things that makes Steemit great for me personally] here a few techniques I use to further my writing and a few resources I\u2019ve found helpful in house, right here on Steemit.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Real-life Inspiration:</strong> As mentioned, take inspiration from people in life. Friends, or even family. Accentuate the personalities. Exaggerate the quirks or circumstances. For me personally, it\u2019s a big help to to have someone in mind when drawing, and developing a character.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Character Inventories:</strong> Write up an involved character inventory [\u2026sometimes called a character bible]. A reference of everything you can imagine that defines that character. Their ethnicity, background, where they were born, how old they are, where they went to college, their diet, etc. It\u2019s tedious if you\u2019re working on a character heavy story with a big \u201ccast\u201d, but it pays dividends. Once you have those inventories, you can stick characters in situations and the story literally writes itself. If you have a character that\u2019s a passionate vegan, you can immediately come up with dozens of possibilities if they were accidentally locked in a butcher\u2019s freezer. Same with politics, religious, social issues. It really unloads much of the burden of dreaming up a brilliant scene.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0107.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1765\"/></p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Name Generators:</strong> Name generators are something I rely on quite a bit. There are many available online. They\u2019re usually free, and they\u2019re a great place to launch in to naming a character. Often times, once you have a name, more of the personality and background unfolds organically. <a href=\"www.seventhsanctum.com\">www.seventhsanctum.com</a> has an excellent list of name generators tailored specifically for several genres and character types.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Research:</strong> This is one of those things that seems obvious, but I challenge you to go deeper. For my ghost story, I started researching life in the mid-1800\u2019s in the Southwest and Dust Bowl of the United States. As I dug through historical sites, I found some of the events of that time. A few hours in, I read about droughts and plagues, which would have been rich content for a story, but going even deeper, I read about these crazy grasshopper plagues! Even deeper, I found accounts of specific families and individuals that described enormous clouds of locusts that swept through their homes and ate everything, including the clothes off their bodies! I encourage you to obsessively push through references, way past where most people would get their first idea and start writing. Beyond that is where you\u2019re going to unearth something truly unique and memorable. I\u2019ve already written a treatment for this epic locust plague in my ghost story [\u2026sort of nervous about what that\u2019s going to be like to draw, though].</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Don\u2019t Lose The Magic:</strong> For me, the magic happens in the moments before I fall asleep. Without fail, that\u2019s where I get my best, originally ideas. Sometimes it\u2019s just a small line a dialog. Other times it\u2019s as vague as a plot point. It\u2019s a tough discipline to wake yourself up and write it down, but that [\u2026for me] is where the magic happens. It\u2019s invaluable, and worth the trouble of having to fall back asleep. I jot things down in the Notes app of my phone. I have some friends that just wake up and make audio recordings. You might get your best ideas during different times. Sometimes I have brilliant moments on long drives. Either way, document it! You\u2019ll be glad you did.</p>\n<p>Honestly, Steemit has been a revolution for me as well. Since the platform is incentivized, there is a tremendous wealth of references on writing, drawing, how-to\u2019s. Beyond that, I spent much of my time reading and curating novels and short stories posted by the authors bringing their work to the site. Just this morning, I found a comprehensive article by @jamielefay titled <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@jamielefay/steemit-and-the-future-of-book-publishing\">\u201cSteemit and the future of book publishing\u201d</a>. Everything here, totally relevant if you\u2019re creating comics or graphic novels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SketchUpdate011.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1130\"/></p>\n<p>Keep writing, creating and sharing! More work from my comic,<a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\"> THIEA</a>, and other stories to come. I\u2019d love feedback and constructive criticism.</p>\n<p>I post daily.

I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/pastel-of-banana-with-chocolate/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](http://www.tudogostoso.com.br/receita/1660-pastel-de-banana.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Yeah, I'm looking at you blurry candids. Sometimes, these pictures may not be the most beautiful but they show the most character and emotion. While San Fran was stunning and the pretty pictures make me happy, those awful ones bring a bigger smile to my face.\n\nExhibit A: My brother stealing my camera and taking some awful selfies.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_3151ed0d4.jpg\n\nMy unsuccessful attempt at getting my camera back. \nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_316477dc6.jpg\n\nMy father checking out some suspicious claw marks during our hike. Excuse me while I pee my pants.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_30259e677.jpg\n\nMy mother unable to stand still for 5 seconds to take a nice photo.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_2716b81d5.jpg\n\nThe baby rattlesnake that I would rather stay far away from than get a good closeup.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_3140f9ea1.jpg\n\nAnd my brother crawling INTO a tree in the RedWood forests...\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_2912437d1.jpg\nI was kinda hoping he'd get stuck.

Female bodies, in particular, undergo changes throughout the entire span of a woman\u2019s life. From puberty, to pregnancy, to menopause, female hormones can change on a dime, altering the physical and emotional state of a woman instantly.But sometimes, these changes can result in more extreme &nbsp;than you would experience with typical bodily phases. PCOS is one of those conditions.Polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, is an endocrine condition caused by elevated levels of&nbsp;androgens, or male hormones, in a woman\u2019s body. The most common symptom&nbsp;of PCOS, one that women everywhere struggle with, is thick .Women with PCOS will experience various degrees of facial hair, or occasionally&nbsp;the condition&nbsp;will reveal itself as adult acne. No matter the physical result, experiencing these changes without knowing much about the condition can be a scary thing. Embarrassing, even, as there are so many social stigmas revolving around what women should and should not look like.If you suspect you may have PCOS, we encourage you to contact your primary care doctor immediately for an evaluation. In the meantime, read on to learn about the symptoms and treatment methods for this common condition.</p>\n<h2>What Is&nbsp;PCOS?</h2>\n<p>Researchers have discovered that the elevated levels of androgens that ultimately cause PCOS are&nbsp;caused by both genetic and environmental factors. The condition has a wide range of symptoms and levels of severity, oftentimes making it difficult to diagnose.Current&nbsp;research suggests it may be linked to insulin, as studies have found PCOS linked to women with higher insulin levels. PCOS is&nbsp;also a risk factor for diabetes, , high blood pressure, sleep apnea, and some .While PCOS can be a difficult condition to handle in day-to-day life, women who live with the condition are certainly not in a minority. About 20&nbsp;percent&nbsp;of women worldwide between the ages of 18 and 44 struggle with the symptoms of PCOS, making this one of the most common hormonal conditions in the world. In the U.S. alone, over 200,000 new cases of PCOS are brought to light each year.</p>\n<h2>What Are The Symptoms?</h2>\n<p>Body hair may be the most well-known symptom of PCOS, but there are so many layers to this condition. If you\u2019ve been noticing excessive weight gain, mood swings, or sudden acne, you may be observing signs of PCOS without even realizing it.</p>\n<h3>1. Abundant Body Hair</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/tiphero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/facial.jpg?w=750\" width=\"750\" height=\"427\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The most common symptom of the condition is . This body hair will vary woman to woman; some ladies will get hair that\u2019s thicker or more fine than others.Location of the hair varies as well. While facial hair is common with PCOS, chest, stomach, and arm hair are also just as likely to grow, depending on the individual and how severe the PCOS is.</p>\n<h3>2. Irregular Periods</h3>\n<p>If your menstruation cycle seems&nbsp;off \u2013 if&nbsp;you\u2019re spotting all month long or you\u2019ll spot two days every&nbsp;week and that\u2019s it \u2013 don\u2019t just blame it on your birth control. PCOS is a hormonal disorder, so a woman\u2019s most prevalent hormonal cycle (menstruation) WILL&nbsp;be thrown off if PCOS is present in the body.Again, this varies woman to woman. Some women will see their periods stop all together, while others will get heavier and more extreme. Some women will even experience a painful cramping in their pelvis rather than a irregular period cycle.</p>\n<h3>3. Weight Gain</h3>\n<p>PCOS does affect your metabolism, so sudden weight gain is another giveaway of the condition. This gain is usually seen in the midsection and is linked to insulin levels; as mentioned, people with PCOS have higher insulin levels and are more likely to have Type II diabetes, which will also encourage weight gain.It is possible to lose weight with PCOS, as long as you understand what herbs, foods, and exercises will help you best! <img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/tiphero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GirlWithAcneforList.jpg?w=750\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;If you thought your &nbsp;were back in 10th grade, but you\u2019re finding yourself suddenly breaking out, this could be because of PCOS.This happens because hormone levels in the body have spiked and oil production has been increased on the skin, causing .&nbsp;This is essentially what happens right before you get your period (more hormones = more oil = more acne), but far more severe in nature.This increased oil production also tends to affect the scalp in people with PCOS, causing intense.</p>\n<h3>5. Anxiety or Depression</h3>\n<p>Because PCOS is a hormonal condition, your mood and mental well-being are affected, too. Like any woman with PMS can tell you, swinging hormones will do a number on your mood and your self-esteem. So with severe hormone imbalances, like with PCOS,&nbsp;women are more likely to be suffering from anxiety, stress, irritation, and depression.What\u2019s more, because the symptoms of PCOS have such a negative connotation with femininity, women with this condition are often wrestling with their perception of themselves and feeling serious emotional strain or pressure.</p>\n<h3>6. Incontinence</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/tiphero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ovary-Diagram.gif?resize=640%2C394\" width=\"640\" height=\"394\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;PCOS prevents the body from ovulating regularly, or sometimes from ovulating at all. For this reason, PCOS is one of the most common fertility issues in the world, preventing many women with the condition from having children.The follicles that normally release an egg from the ovary never mature due to lack of hormone, and so the eggs remain in the ovary, unable to be fertilized.&nbsp;Pregnancy is possible with PCOS, but extra fertility treatments may be required.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How Is PCOS Treated?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no cure for PCOS. However, there are treatments to help women subdue symptoms or cope with the condition. If you\u2019re experiencing any of the symptoms listed above, you may want to explore the follow options for treatment of PCOS.</p>\n<h3>1. Try Magnesium</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/tiphero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dollarphotoclub_59846549-e1428596118670.jpg?w=750\" width=\"750\" height=\"501\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;This mineral is often helped to keep blood pressure regular, but it also helps to keep hormones in check.Studies have found that women with PCOS are lacking this mineral, so absorbing it by taking supplements (like&nbsp;), taking , or using&nbsp; &nbsp;may help to regulate hormones and reduce the effects of PCOS.</p>\n<h3>2. Consult a&nbsp;Aesthetician</h3>\n<p>As we all know (mainly because we\u2019re bombarded by their advertisements), there are many ways to or manually remove body hair. If you\u2019re looking to limit or remove your body hair, weigh the pros and cons of , waxing, creams and bleaches,&nbsp;laser removal, and electrolysis.Just know, that you will most likely need to keep up with whatever treatment you choose. Even laser removal (which usually stops follicles from producing hair all together) has been proven unsuccessful for many people with PCOS.Another option is to&nbsp;grow your hair out and own it! , an amazing role model for women living with PCOS, chose to grow out her bread after 39 years of hiding her body hair. She now flaunts her new look on Instagram and feels truly empowered by her choice.Bottom line: forget what other people have to say, <em><strong>the choice of what you do with your body hair is truly yours</strong></em>.</p>\n<h3>3. Exercise More</h3>\n<p>PCOS will be negatively affecting your metabolism and causing weight gain, as we covered above. So the best way to fight back and regulate your metabolism? &nbsp;HARD.If you have PCOS, you should try a 15-30 workout every day at high intensity \u2013 meaning you should break a sweat within the first few minutes. You may also want to try resistance training to further impact your metabolism.Consult your doctor first to see where you should begin exercising based on your fitness level.</p>\n<h3>4. Change Your Diet</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/tiphero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salmon-Edited.jpg?w=750\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Certain foods will raise hormone and insulin levels, only aggravating your symptoms further. So the best change to make first and foremost is a&nbsp;dietary one.For managing insulin levels, look for low-glycemic foods and eat plenty of leafy greens, fresh fruits, lean meats, and &nbsp;Avoid processed foods, dairy, and soy products, all&nbsp;of which can cause spikes in insulin levels and worsen symptoms.</p>\n<h3>5. Talk to a Therapist</h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re living with PCOS, you not only are experiencing a lot of dramatic hormonal shifts, but you\u2019re also struggling with how society views you. You may feel ashamed, unattractive, or out of control, feelings which will only heighten your anxiety or depression.Seek professional counseling if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed. They will act as a positive outlet to express your frustrations and help you learn how to cope with life\u2019s daily challenges.</p>\n<h3>6. Talk to Your Doctor</h3>\n<p>Finally, talking to your doctor is always a good thing. Your physician can not only confirm if your symptoms are PCOS, but they may be able to offer you a medical treatment to the condition, too.As we said, there is no cure for PCOS, but there are medicines you can take to help keep your hormones level and reduce symptoms. Talk to your doctor about finding the right medication for you. As with all things, make sure you consult your doctor before trying any treatments for PCOS. Just because you think the symptoms line up with your experience, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean PCOS&nbsp;is the underlying issue!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;source &gt;tiphero.com//lifestyle&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "lately due to a bar set too high. Waiting until the perfect circumstances, and written work/studying. The truth is I already have lots to offer people like the newer members on here. I would like to share with any newcomers, that we do not need to write a mastermind post. I think many people have writers block along with myself. I came on the site today for the first time in over a week. I was not planning on writing much, but once I got some intuition, I acted on it, and have come up with what follows, mainly for newer users, like minnows, but can also offer something to the small fish, and even dolphins. If a Whale dares to read on, I give them much respect and am surprised as well as proud that the Whales are not all full of a big ego, due to all of the minnows they eat.\n\n![helpmecreate3efe9.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/helpmecreate3efe9.jpg)\n\n>**\"Writers block comes from wanting to be perfect, and not creating, not using your skills until you find the perfect words. This inevitably leads to one losing their skills, and learning to be good at procrastination\".** -keithwillshine\n\nA post does not need to be like the top trending.... There is no right and wrong. I feel like some whales have scared off a lot of minnows. The high numbers in a Whales wallet can be very discouraging, but we do not need to be them. We are our own creator, our own individual personalities and traits, along with our life's lessons and past wisdom that we can offer.  As long as we offer our knowledge, small or large. We all have something to offer, and there is always someone who can be lifted up, or reminded by our words. People who can, or choose not to learn, or gain higher perspective from our personal stories and Ideas will not read your post, so you are really helping and not taking away from the internet by releasing your personal ideas and stories. \n\n![walletsteem50196.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/walletsteem50196.jpg)\n\nWe can post when we feel the urge, do not worry about perfection (When I do this I tend to not finish due to getting distracted, and losing the motivation). Post when the Idea is fresh, do not procrastinate, and once you put yourr fingers to the keyboard, you will be surprised on the words and Ideas that flow through you. This is what the whales have mastered.... Acting on intuitions, Impulses, and sharing what they are thinking. Sharing what they have learned, and over time, They become good, just like with anything, if you keep at it, and do not limit yourself, you will become a 'Master Blogger' or 'Whale' in no time at all.\n\n\nBefore long, you will gain a sense of confidence and self worth. The lack of this is what keeps you in the cycle of failure. I myself have a real issue with this. I find myself starting something with a lot of confidence, and motivation, and can feel the joy that drives me to create. Then before long, We find roadblocks that halt our progress and success. These are the tests, and/or tension that are needed to learn and grow. Just as a seed needs the dirt to push through to give it growth and strength. You must take a short break to let yourself step away and focus on something else so that the answer can come to you naturally. Nature is really the best teacher, and has the best metaphors for life.\n\n![seed1liftingbfb46.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/seed1liftingbfb46.jpg)\n\nI promise you, that if you can post a blog, especially personal blogs, you will grow into a better version of yourself. You can gain confidence in life, you will gain a life's skill that will be very valuable if Steemit  is still in your life years down the road or not. Everything is on the internet these days, and will grow toward that direction more, and more, and a blogger/ article writer/ content creator is what every company can use today, or in the future. I can also say you will (whether you understand how or not) gain value, and worth in yourself and your profile if you are consistent. If you miss a week, do not worry or stress, nobody can keep up with the mass of people generating new content. What matters, is that you do not let it bring you down, do not feel guilty about this, because it will hold you back in present and future opportunities to generate a post. \n\n>**\"Maybe ask another blogger how to get over the bump in the road\"** -keithwillshine\n\nHave small goals to start, even just telling the world about you, and your interests can get you learning how a post is written, and will teach you consistency. Maybe experiment down the road, but start with simple short well written and edited posts. It matters more that you use proper grammar and visually pleasing posts to whales, because they want the site they own to look good to attract more, and higher valued people. If you can, login to Steemit even if it is just to Up-vote, comment on something you have thoughts on and see whats trending.  There is no need to fear with commenting, it is a good way to start getting your name out there, and be remembered. This will bring you more worth to Steemit, as they will see you are a consistent user, giving even 5-20 min per day is better than an hour once per week or month.\n\n**Keep your eyes open to what is out there and put yourself out there for others to find**\n I guarantee if you make it part of your daily routine, you will have people buzzing before long, and attract people like you and who think about similar ideas in the form of followers. Who knows, you may even find your soul mate, or some new friends through this and other similar platforms, but you must be active to some degree on them, start commenting on others posts, try to gain some followers once you have content.\n\n![girlstalkingaboutblogsteemit24804.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/girlstalkingaboutblogsteemit24804.jpg)",

What are the uses for sage?<br>\nMai: It helps protect human cells from oxidation and reduces internal inflammation.<br>\nMe: Thank you.<br>\nMai: It's my pleasure.<br>\n</blockquote>\n\nYou start to think having an on-demand AI by your side isn't so bad. But you are sure Kai is monitoring every request for this game you've unexpectedly stepped into. \n\nYou approach the hackerspace and no one is outside. You see some activity on the fourth floor, and some plants being grown in plastic bottles with tubes connected.\n\n<blockquote>\nPat: What is the plant growing in that window on the fourth floor?<br>\nMai: It is Fragaria Vesca or Alpine Strawberry.\n</blockquote>\n\nThey are growing alpine strawberries? Maybe this knowledge can be the proof that you have access to some powerful resources.\n\nYou have walked past the hackerspace and notice someone has left their sleeping bag, backpack, a piece of cardboard, and a sharpie in the entrance of a abandoned store front. \n\nYou reach down to grab the cardboard and see that one side has the words \"Homeless. Please Help.\" written on it. You remind yourself to return the sign when you are done flagging down anyone you can find in the hackerspace.\n\nAfter you make it around the block, you see a slightly obese man with glasses vaping near the hackerspace entrance. He has a black t-shirt that says <em>Ned's Atomic Dustbin</em>.  As you pass him, you hold the side of the sign you have written on at belly level so the camera can't see.\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/x4JOdE8.jpg</center>\n\nThe hacker looks at you funny and mouths the words: \"Yeah right.\" Your t-shirt and jeans make you look pretty average, but definitely not homeless.\n\nYou rotate the sign to see the reflection on a nearby window and flip the sign.\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/6HqLmII.jpg</center>\n\nThe hacker gets a more serious look on his face and releases a vapor cloud that smells like strawberries. As you get closer to him, he silently mouths the following message: \"Keep walking in a large loop until this time today. I can help you after that.\"\n\nThere are 3 additional blocks you can add to your walk to make it a 3 or 4 mile loop. You think this is doable and assume he will use the recorded photos to create an endless loop while you work with him to hack the phone.\n\nAll the familiar feelings of fall are present out here with cool breeze gusts blending the displaced air from each passing car. The sun is just above you and off to the left whenever you head north towards a nearby highway. You figure it is two o'clock in the afternoon. \n\n<hr>\n\nFor the first time you start to see how beautiful this part of the city is. Wide sidewalks connect the road to the business entrances, but there are enough trees that, from a bird's eye view, the row of green canopy prevents this neighborhood from looking like a concrete eyesore. \n\nYou complete your loop twice without seeing the hacker outside and it is now 5 o'clock in the evening. The homeless person has returned and seems to be looking for his sign. You cross out your message and return it to him with his marker and leave him a dollar. You have $49 dollars left.\n\nAfter the next loop, your stomach starts growling, and you wonder if Mai could help you whip up a salad from the few community gardens you've passed, but you notice there is a paper bag at the hackerspace with the following words written on the front:\n\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/9SOyhKD.jpg</center>\n\nInside the bag is a water bottle, an apple, and a KIND bar.\n\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/pXLIXWx.jpg</center>\n\nAfter your walking meal, you take a look at the caffeine pill. If the game you are playing was designed to get you to to recreate the caffeine pill with herbs or plants, you figure you might as well try recreating the pill. In the worst case scenario, you could at least prove you've been playing the game. You ask Mai to quietly log the compounds inside the pill.\n\nYou proceed to toss the trash in your hands into a nearby garbage can, but notice there are words written on the inside of the water bottle label.\n\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/NhoIpAU.jpg</center>\n\nBrute force? They may be referring to trying a lot of different options to see what happens. You've only used your index finger to access the computer, so you proceed to try all of your fingers on the fingerprint reader to see what the computer does:\n\nRight:\n- thumb - nothing.\n- index - already tried this.\n- middle - nothing.\n- ring - the fingerprint scanner blinks four times.\n- pinky - nothing.\n\nLeft: \n- thumb - nothing.\n- index - the fingerprint scanner blinks seven times.\n- middle - nothing.\n- ring - nothing.\n- pinky - nothing.\n\nWhy did certain fingers cause the scanner to blink? When you place your right forearm over you left forearm and assign the number one to your right thumb and count up, the three digits that engage the computer are 2, 4, and 7. These were the same numbers written on your key.\n\n<hr>\nIt is night time now, and the sudden sounds of rush hour car has diminished. The street lights seem to illuminate the street, but leave leaf shadows on your sidewalk path. There is still a light cool breeze shifting those shadows as you make your way around the block.\n\nYou ask Fai what time it is. He says, \"It's 3 o'clock in the morning.\"\n\nThe homeless person appears to be resting.  You borrow his sign and marker again to share your brute force hack findings with your hacker friends. You also leave a small hint of information that would be difficult for any human to get, so they know that you are not alone.\n\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/q9TtLPu.jpg</center>\n\nThe hacker guy is now joined by a girl three-quarters his height with blonder hair that has the last foot dyed an electric blue. The hacker girl silently mouths, \"How did you know that we were growing hydroponic strawberries?\"\n\nI silently mouth back, \"AI.\"\n\nFai tells you it is 8 o'clock in the morning, but your legs need a break. You almost passed out in the crosswalk while thirty minutes ago. You reach for the caffeine pill and let it dissolve under your tongue.\n\nImmedietly you feel blood pumping at a faster pace and your eyes open up a bit. The kick with this caffeine is much stronger that the coffee you are used to. You know you have about 10 hours before you pass out for a full day.\n\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/Ol0bqfb.jpg</center>\nThe hacker boy and girl have left you another bag of food around 1 o'clock in the afternoon. You eat the kind bar, but leave the apple and half the water for the homeless guy. You ask him what his name is and he says, \"Jim.\"\n\nJim thanks you for the food and you figure this lap will be the last you have to do before you check in.\n\nAbout 20 yards from the hackerspace, the guy hacker is standing in an alley with his laptop. You try not to let the camera see him. As you pass him in the shadows, he mouths slow down. After a few seconds he tells you to stop walking.\n\n<blockquote>Hacker Guy: \"I was able to bluejack the computer and are now feeding it a 24 hour video loop based on the data the camera sends. We have at least one day to figure out how to get you out of this mess.\"</blockquote>\n\nThis hacker guy introduces himself as Claude, and the hacker girl's name is Sheena. They both sit down and listen to your story and start to look less confident than they did when you first walked in.\n\n<blockquote>\nClaude: I looked up that number '247' and the only thing I could find was a patent for a drug ending in 247. The patent number was US90812247 for a drug named Buzz. It references research from patent number US 6024988 A. The goal of the '247' patent is to make a drug that keeps you awake on one hour of sleep.<br>\nSheena: Did you figure out anything else beside the numbers 2, 4, and 7?\nYou: No. \n</blockquote>\n\nYou explain that you've taken a strong caffeine pill and will soon be asleep for 24 hours.\n\nClaude said with such little time, the next best way to get into the computer was to either reproduce your fingerprint or to install a cable in your finger that would act as an interface to the computer while your index finger was on the computer's finger scanner.\n\nSheena said this method was risky, but you said, \"If it helps me get out of this game it is worth the risk.\"\n\nClaude and Sheena looked at each other and said, \"We have a couple of collegues who are professionals at biohacking. We'll have them install this interface while you sleep.\"\n\nYou agreed to this plan and introduced yourself as Pat.\n\n<hr>\n\nTheir hackerspace seemed be crammed in with boxes near the entrance stacked to the ceiling. The walls were overloaded with posters from the many conferences they attended along with posters of obscure bands from a decade or two ago.\n\nYou feel a small creature vibrating and hear, \"Meow.\" This must be their hackerspace cat. It was a turkish van with white puffy hair.\n\nYou start petting the cat, and noticed your body getting heavy. You passed out on the couch on close your eyes.\n\n<hr>\n\nYou wake up and see that Claude and Sheena were in the hallway talking to each other, and a couple people who were behind you lean forward to chat.\n\n<blockquote>\nBlack Market Surgeon: Hello! How are you doing?<br>\nMe: My finger hurts a lot. Do you have anything for the pain?<br>\nBMS: Here try this. He receives a pill from a nurse. The bottle is labelled with the word <em>fentanyl.</em><br>\nMe: This feels much better. Thanks.<br>\n</blockquote>\n\nYou see that there is a laptop behind your head and look down at your right index finger to see a small usb cable hanging out. The wound and wire entry point is wrapped in a fresh gauze that has a couple drops of blood near the surface. A couple nurses shuffle out of a bathroom with 3 or 4 partially zipped duffle bags from a rear corridor.  \n\n<hr>\n\nA) Grab the cable from the laptop and see if you can access your computer's operating system.\nB) Take a nap.\nC) Ask Fai what compounds are in fentanyl.",

Parking is getting more difficult, managed to walk 4.80 miles yesterday (7.7km) so killing two birds with one stone!  \n\nI really enjoy chatting with some of these artsists and can certainly relate to many of them in that they do what they do just for the sake of creating art.

Meeting so many interesting people has been even better. SteemIt has helped me to \"come out of my shell.\" This is in no small part because I did an #introduceyourself post here: https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@nonlinearone/hello-world-physics-ph-d-with-a-love-for-particle-physics-code-hiking-and-blockchains-here\n\nI've been posting information online for at least twenty years, but that was new for me. Doing the #introduceyourself made me reflect and put myself out there. I realize now that being \"kind of\" anonymous online was not working for me. It was getting me nowhere. \n\nNote that I believe that the ability to be anonymous is still important, but it's not a great way to build a personal brand. Unless you're Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIn any case, I'm glad I tried SteemIt. Thanks again and to say thank you I'm giving away 5 STEEM DOLLARS (with which you can buy an <a href=\"http://www.kmart.com/essential-home-live-love-laugh-13inch-x-5inch/p-048W001694159001P?plpSellerId=Kmart&prdNo=4&blockNo=4&blockType=G4\">oven mitt at KMart or something</a>) to my 200th follower. Please only follow me if you like the stuff I post. I'll wait for this post to \"pay out\" before sending the $5.\n\np.s.\n\nI'll also send $5 to the person who introduced me to SteemIt, https://steemit.com/@morpheustitania \nYou should follow him too. Thanks Morpheus.\nNew :) Email \"decentralized\" to bryangmyrekcom@gmail.com to join my new newsletter about decentralized technologies, nature, and more. \n\nHere are a few of my recent posts:\n\nhttps://steemit.com/blockchain/@nonlinearone/i-m-starting-a-newsletter-about-blockchain-technology\n\nhttps://steemit.com/writing/@nonlinearone/can-hemingway-improve-your-writing\n\nhttps://steemit.com/blockchain/@nonlinearone/ethereum-classic-the-blockchain-that-refused-to-fork-at-the-blockchain-meetup-in-phoenix-az-14-sep-2016\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CUqmcVvb.jpg?1\nBryan Gmyrek lives in sunny Arizona with his wife, three sons, and two golden puppies.

    "body": "<html>\n<p>September 17, 1949 is etched into my family\u2019s minds for two reasons. It was the day my parents were married at Little Norway Anglican Church in Toronto. My aunt had to stand in as the maid-of-honour that day as my mother\u2019s best friend, Eileen, who was supposed to take that part, was caught up in the aftermath of the second reason.</p>\n<p>The burning of the steamship SS Noronic in the Toronto Harbour, which took upwards of 139 lives. One Canadian and the rest Americans perished in the fire that started in the early hours of that day.</p>\n<h2>Great Lakes Steamship Cruising</h2>\n<p>Sometimes referred to as \u201cinland seas\u201d, the great lakes of North America form the largest inland body of fresh water in the world. The group of five interconnected lakes straddle the Canadian-American border with the exception of Lake Michigan which is completely in the US. With a mass of 90,000 square miles and stretching 1,555 miles they provided a varied playground for those with means and desire to take leisurely cruises.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cruise ships plied the waters of the lakes from the early 19th century onward. It was the opening of the fourth Welland canal in 1913 between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario which expanded the market for luxury steamships travelling the great lakes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The era between 1913 and 1965 saw luxury steamships that rivalled the great ocean liners taking passengers around the great lakes on cruises. It was a popular activity and profitable for the ship lines running them. A lack of meaningful safety regulations helped keep their costs down.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SS Noronic&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>The Northern Navigation Company had the Noronic built by the Western Dry Dock and Shipbuilding Company of Port Arthur, Ontario in 1913. At the time she was one of the largest steamships on the great lakes at the time measuring 362 feet x 52 feet x 24.8 feet (110 metres x 15.8 metres x 7.5 metres)and a tonnage of 6,905 with five decks. She could carry up to 600 passengers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JS6TyRk.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"322\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"\u00a0https://www.flickr.com/photos/23655958@N03/2798984160\">Source </a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Noronic would be referred to as \u201cThe Queen of the Lakes\u201d. She was outfitted in luxury and included: a ballroom, dining hall, barber shop, beauty salon, music &amp; writing rooms, library, children\u2019s playroom and even had its own newspaper printed on board for the passengers. The passage ways were lined with wood that had been oiled with lemon oil frequently over the 40 years the shipped sailed the great lakes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lnXna60l.jpg\" width=\"575\" height=\"345\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://torontoist.com/2011/09/historicist-queen-of-the-great-lakes-aflame/\">Source&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Her maiden voyage was delayed when one of the biggest storms in Great Lakes history roared into the area. For three days, the SS Noronic sat in the harbour while the storm raged with hurricane force winds and waves upwards of 49 feet high (about 15 meters). Over 250 died, 12 ships were sunk and 29 other ships would be damaged and stranded.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rVRymjrl.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"494\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/v-for-victory-on-noronic-2\">Source&nbsp;</a></p>\n<h2>Canada Steamship Lines</h2>\n<p>Not long after her maiden voyage the Noronic and all the rest of the ships of the Northern Navigation Company were acquired by Canada Steamship Lines. CSL remains today as one of Canada\u2019s largest shipping lines. In 1981 Paul Martin was one of a small group buying CSL from Power Corporation. He would later become the Right Honourable Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada from 2003 to 2006.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Noronic\u2019s Master \u2014 Captain William Taylor&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Born in Moore Township, Ontario on September 1, 1833, Captain Taylor began his sailing career at the age of 18 when he was taken on as a wheelman on an American ship. He worked his way up through the ranks and acquired his Master\u2019s papers in 1932.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/nClryPd.jpg\" width=\"486\" height=\"708\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mooremuseum.ca/newsletter-articles/violently-vanished-landmark-and-its-local-victims\">Source&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>By 1934 he was serving as the Master of the SS Huronic, one of two sister ships to the Noronic. He served briefly as the Master of the other sister ship, the SS Harmonic. He wasn\u2019t master when it burned in the CSL sheds in 1945 with no loss of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Noronic\u2019s Final Voyage</h2>\n<p>The SS Noronic set out for what was to be the last trip of the season on September 14, 1949 from Detroit. Stopping in Cleveland for more passengers it would be carrying 529 passengers, all American. The crew consisted of 171 Canadians.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The week long trip was to travel to Prescott, Ontario and the Thousands Islands in the St. Lawrence River before returning via Toronto to Detroit. The Noronic would have then sailed to Sarnia where it would remain for the winter.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pier 9 In Toronto Harbour&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>It had been an uneventful trip when the SS Noronic steamed into Toronto Harbour and tied up at Pier 9. Today, so many changes have been made at the Harbour and so much of the harbour claimed for land, where the bow of the Noronic was tied up is now the lobby of the Westin Harbour Castle Hotel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The captain and all but 15 of the crew went ashore along with most of the passengers. They headed into downtown Toronto to enjoy the evening. Many of the remaining passengers went to the dancehall. Since the bar was closed while in port, they took their own bottles and partied together.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Captain Taylor returned to the ship around 1:30am most of the passengers and crew had returned and the ship was quiet.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fire Is Discovered&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Around 2:30am a passenger notice smoke on C deck and traced it to a linen closet near a ladies washroom. He located a bellboy who rather than sound the alarm ran to get the keys to the closet from the steward\u2019s office on D deck. When he opened the closet, the inrush of air fueled the smoldering fire and it flared up and out into the corridor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The passenger and the bellboy tried to fight the flames but the fire extinguisher was useless and the fire hose didn\u2019t work properly. They fled sounding the alarm. The fire moved quickly fueled by the well oiled wood lining the corridors and the open stairwells provided a chimney effect to feed the fire oxygen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Captain Taylor was notified and the first mate sounded the ship\u2019s whistle. But instead of the distress signal the whistle jammed itself into one long unrelenting shriek. Some described it as the ship\u2019s death cry.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Panic and Fear Takes Over</h2>\n<p>Within 10 minutes half the ship was on fire and within minutes more, the rest of it was. Panic ensued. The passengers had never been given any kind of emergency drill and there was only one exit passageway instead of an exit on each deck.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most members of the crew escaped the ship immediately. Those who remained, including Captain Taylor raced through the parts of the ship they could reach hammering on doors to rouse sleeping passengers. In some cases they smashed out windows to help passengers get off the ship.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Panic led to desperation fuelled by the rush of the flames. Passengers started jumping off the ship, many into the cold water of the harbour, some onto the pier risking injuries or death. One person did die on the pier. Others missed and landed on other decks, injuring themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Jsiby4Yl.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"511\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://storage.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297514400031_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&amp;size=650x&amp;stmp=1389791976588\">Source&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>When fire and rescue arrived from land, they attempted to swing rescue ladders around to the ship only to have panicked passengers leaping onto them and either breaking them or, in one case, toppling the truck. Captain Taylor had to jump over the bow to avoid the flames.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Those arriving on shore were quick to start rescuing people from the cold water of the harbour. Only one of the dead drowned. At first they tried to lower ladders for people to climb out of the water but they were so panicked they overloaded the ladders and they sank into the harbour. Ropes were used.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ambulances, taxis and any other vehicle willing to help was pressed into service to take the injured to nearby hospitals. Many of the injured suffered from burns. The lone Canadian casualty, Louisa Dustin, an employee of Canadian Steamship Lines and travelling as a passenger, died a few weeks later as the result of her burns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fire boats finally arrived to fight the fire from the water while ladder trucks on the dockside rained water onto the fierce fire.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hours Later the Fire is Out&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Dawn was starting to light the sky when the last of the fire was extinguished around 5:3am. At times the flames and heat had been so intense during the night that parts of the ship had been warped.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The name of the ship on the bow was down at the waterline by the time the fire was out. Divers would have to search later below the waterline to find some of the dead. It would be hours later, around 10am before the fire ravaged shell had cooled enough for anyone to venture onboard. What lay before them was almost beyond description.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/zJYP8Ga.jpg\" width=\"465\" height=\"290\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/541839398894872949/\">Source&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Edwin Feeney was a reporter for the Toronto Star at the time and one of the first reporters allowed on. Years later, after he had retired, I knew him. At the mention of the Noronic, you could see his face cloud over and his involuntary shutter. He didn\u2019t want to talk about those memories.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most on board burned to death. Some died trampled underfoot by fleeing passengers. Groups of passengers were found clustered together in rooms, presumably family members. The bodies were found all over the ship. Some bodies were never found, thus the uncertainty of how many actually died. About 118 were known killed and figures range up to 139 but that is not confirmed.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dealing With The Aftermath&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>The Horticultural Building at the CNE (Canadian National Exhibition) grounds was pressed into service as a temporary morgue to deal with the remains. Family members would be weeks trying to identify clothing and personal possessions of their loved ones. It would be a year before the unclaimed remains were laid to rest at Mount Pleasant Cemetary in Toronto.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in downtown Toronto dealt with up to 100 injured passengers and their care for weeks afterward.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Horticultural Building at the CNE (Canadian National Exhibition) grounds was pressed into service as a temporary morgue to deal with the remains. Family members would be weeks trying to identify clothing and personal possessions of their loved ones. It would be a year before the unclaimed remains were laid to rest at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The landmark Royal York Hotel became a reception centre and shelter for the rest of the passengers. My mother\u2019s friend Eileen was an employee there. She had to return to work that day to help with the passengers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/kQbOsxll.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"514\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\" https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/once-upon-a-city-archives/2015/09/17/once-upon-a-city-the-day-the-ss-noronic-turned-torontos-waterfront-into-a-deadly-inferno.html\">Source</a></p>\n<h2>The Federal Inquiry&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>The federal government held an inquiry into the disaster. They deemed the cause of the fire to be likely a cigarette dropped in the linen closet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 1950 the CSL ship Quebec burned after a fire was deliberately lit in a linen closet. The similarities raised the possibility that the Noronic had been arson as well but was never pursue or proven.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The inquiry found Captain Taylor and Canada Steamship Lines at fault for the disaster. They ruled that Captain Taylor should have had enough awareness of safety needs to have seen the possibility of a tragedy happening. They suspended his master\u2019s certification for one year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Canada Steamship Lines settled the various claims that passengers and families made against them for $2million dollars.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What Happened to Captain Taylor?&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Canada Steamship Lines continued to pay Captain Taylor through the shipping season of 1950 and would have taken him back after his suspension. He never asked for his certification back. Nor did he ever sail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He returned to Sarnia. He and his wife took up residence in a small apartment in Sarnia and he took a job as a desk clerk at a local hotel. He died in February 1962 at the age of 79 and his wife passed in 1970.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The End of the Steamship Era</h2>\n<p>The strict safety regulations brought in after the Noronic fire signalled the end of the era for Great Lake steamships. The cost of retrofitting them to meet the new regulations was just too prohibitive. Some held on until the last one was retired in 1967.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>If you like this, please follow me and upvote the post.&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>If you\u2019d like to see what else I\u2019ve posted, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@shadowspub\">just visit my profile&nbsp;</a></h3>\n<h3>If you\u2019d like to be notified when I post next, <a href=\"http://www.pattimay.com/subscribe/\">join my mailing list here.&nbsp;</a></h3>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "Little things have scared me, like walking home on a dark night alone, thinking I was being followed, being attacked by my daughter. The one thing that has really scared me and made me realise how fragile all our lives are is:\n\nI was driving along the road to the metrocentre, Glen in the passenger seat and my 2 girls in the back. Jessica was playing up again, taking her seat belt off and climbing around the car, when we passed a crash, luckily Jessica noticed it and she put her seat belt back on, within minute of her doing this we heard a loud bang, there in front of me was a stationery car, I couldn\u2019t stop. I was doing 40mph straight into the back of it. Funnily enough about 20 mins before we hit I had noticed this yellow car in front with a private reg, having a joke I said look at that posh git, well yes that\u2019s the car I hit..*But it doesn\u2019t end there*\n\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/4jraqc61p/car_crash.jpg</center>\n\nWhen we managed to get out of the car, with my vectra a right off. We noticed there was 2 other cars in front of the one I had hit, luckily or I should say unlucky for me the car behind me had managed to turn off just before the crash thus leaving a larger gap behind.. so with me being the fourth car I was to blame, My kids were screaming in the back, thankfully nothing serious, apart from minor whiplash, scratches and bruising we were all ok.\nGlen went to help the lady in the car in front of mine, and went to see if the others were ok. He got told by the lady in the first car, she was sorry she had suddenly stopped as the person behind her had clipped her, not pulling over to the side, just stopped in the middle of the road.\n\nWe all got out of our cars and waited at the side of the road, luckily for us all there was a policeman on a motorbike on the bridge above, he had come straight down to control things, Us being the only family that needed to go to hospital. One thing we really shouldn\u2019t have done, we should have waited to hear what everyone else had to say.\nWhen we got back home and the very same policeman came, all the stories had been changed, she denied stopping, she denied being clipped and I was to blame, he had said luckily the road was very congested that day and the speed was only 40 mph, usually its around 70.. Scares me what could have happened and what I could have lost.\n\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/72czr0rrx/blame1.jpg</center>\n\nI had been driving for 15 years without an accident, Now here I was being cautioned for a four car pile up..the feelings I had were terrible, I felt useless, couldn\u2019t sleep or eat, I had nightmares with the screams of the kids.\nWhat really made matters worse was, about a month after the accident we all got a letter from the husband of the lady in the car in front of mine, thanking someone else for all there help getting there wife out of the car. That was my husband, and asking if we could please deal with this as quickly as possible..\nThe crash itself plays in my mind in slow motion, at the time of the crash I got a horrible taste in my mouth, the sickness in the bottom of my stomach.\n* What I could have lost that day*\nNow I am an extra careful driver, if I seem to be getting to close I get those feeling again, the taste in the mouth, the sickly feeling then I back off. Maybe it\u2019s a warning..\nMy kids still remember the crash, with Jessica over reacting again, she says, remember when you had that car crash and I broke my neck..It could have happened, if she hadn\u2019t had put her seat belt on after seeing the crash in front, she might not have been here\u2026it is to scary to think about..\n\nPlease drive carefully, take notice of other drivers, you could be the most perfect driver but if someone on the roads makes a mistake you could be the one who pays dearly for it..take your time..and BE AWARE\nThanks for reading\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/w3sdl01b1/20150513_135841.jpg |Hi I am Karen, I am here to write about my life and read about yours..

    "body": "You must have heard that  life is a journey, not a destination. This is the big truth that we, repeatedly, understand superficially. Often we are so focused on the goal, that we completely forget to enjoy the path.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX2i/70e07ec186.png\n\nWhen we achieve the goal, we forget to enjoy it and immediately create a new goal. That is not life, this is racing with life. I am certain that you will not be happy, bur rather tired. Soul searches for the experience, while the mind and ego give signs if something is good or bad for us. Soul is completely indifferent. For the soul, every experience means celebration, while you are maybe crying because of the mind, to whom literally a lot of things does not make sense. \n\nThe same applies to the transformation called *death*. We celebrate resurrection as the greatest symbol of life, and then we are crying in the moment of someone's death. The mind is strange, isn't it?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX1U/3cc83557c6.png\n\nRelax. It doesn't matter where you are in your level of expansion, you can't miss the road to home. While you are breathing, you are on the right track. Try to accept this moment as a moment in which there is no goal, and there is no end. The game never ends. This is excellent news. We came here to play, not to win. The game ends with victory, and God's Child in us still wants to play.\n\nOne beautiful wisdom reminds us: *\"Everything will be fine. If it isn't fine, then it isn't the end.\"* You always have the chance for new choices. This is very important to understand. You shouldn't hate the process just because you are not on your imaginary goal. You trust the process. You are exactly where your soul wants you to be. Don't let your mind tell you any different. \n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbXjG/ea493b7d14.png\n\nEverything is always a matter of the focus on things you have instead of the things you are missing. Today, again you are taking for granted the things that once were a goal. You forget to enjoy. Time is only an illusion of the mind. What if that is the point that you current process wants to teach you? If time is illusion, and it is, what's the hurry?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbWSn/313549d802.png\n\nTake a deep breath in and out. Experience life in the breath. The only goal is hiding in the breath of life.  Everything is good, just the way it is. Don't forget that nothing ever happens without the God's blessing. Don't forget that you are guided. And, the most important, don't forget that we would most certainly go wrong if we'd try to determine what is the best time for us. The one who sees the big picture knows where you're headed and where you want to arrive.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbWLA/86e34b50b7.png\n\nTrust the process. It is the true test of our faith and wisdom. And enjoy. Without it nothing makes sense, right?\nThe sentence that many repeat in the end of the road: *\"I should've enjoyed more!\"*\n\nAll our life is a mere blink of an eye in the eternity. It is too small for such amount of worry. The life is not a serious thing, just the opposite. Life is the experience game. The point is not in the destination. The journey is our only destination. Isn't it then wiser to enjoy right away?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX8F/2ea42f6dc9.png\n\n*\"Success isn't measured by money or material things.*\n*Success is measured by the amount of joy you feel.\"*\n\nFor more awesome images check this guy: [Psychedelic Maniac](thepsychedelicmaniac.tumblr.com)",

People were jammed into the church with a standing-room-only crowd of both young and old flowing out onto the sidewalk. When I noticed a hearse by the curb, I realized it was a funeral. And given the crowd, I assumed that it was the celebration of the life of some local hero\u2014perhaps a wealthy businessperson or a famous personality. Curious, I said to the desk clerk, \u201cThat\u2019s an amazing turnout for a funeral; it must be for a famous person in town.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t rich or famous but he was a good man.\u201d\n\nThis reminded me of the wisdom of the proverb that says, \u201cA good name is more desirable than great riches\u201d (Prov. 22:1). It\u2019s a good idea to think about what kind of legacy we are leaving for our family, friends, and neighbors. From God\u2019s perspective it\u2019s not our resum\u00e9 or the amount of money we\u2019ve accumulated that matters but rather the kind of life we have lived.\n\nWhen a friend of mine passed away, his daughter wrote, \u201cThis world has lost a righteous man and in this world that is no small thing!\u201d It\u2019s that kind of legacy that we should be seeking for the glory of God. \u2014Joe Stowell\n\n    Lord, help me to pursue a life that is pleasing to You and honors Your name.\n\nLive to leave a legacy for God\u2019s glory.\n\nINSIGHT: The Proverbs hold wisdom to help us live for the Lord and leave a legacy. Just the first 8 verses of Proverbs 22 are loaded with wonderful insights about many different aspects of life. Verse 1 tells us of the value of a good name. The Hebrew word for \u201cgood name\u201d carries with it the idea of \u201cgood repute\u201d (see Eccl. 7:1). Dennis Fisher\n\nYour vote will makes a different.\n\nRead: Proverbs 22:1-12\nBible in a Year: Psalms 91-93; Romans 15:1-13\n-odb.org",

Nothings changing. \nEverything visible is just going one way, down.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_ONyukSLqA\n\nAll efforts promoted as solutions are built around the current mess. None of the people in charge would change anything substantial. Its  not in their interest, it would hurt their standing. \nThey preferably gonna milk this cow until it's certain death. \n\nI really wonder, whether its justified to call it a scam already. The way it was introduced and it is maintained never added any value to the platform, only to its insiders, on the back of the successors. \nSo thats a Ponzi Scheme, right, ugly word, isn't it?\n\nYou call yourself a social media platform, but refuse to look at how your users would like to interact with each other, pretending its for the better of the system. It seems like user interaction and freedom of use is the least of your concerns. Factually, every measure you've taken was curbed by one condition, to keep the eggs together as long and as close as possible and cut off as much capital as you could.\n\nIn the real world, which you pretend to address, your projection just doesn't work.\nThe picture on the wall is dim and has a lot of blind spots. The system itself is fine, well done. \nBut most people in charge for the project are still talking out of their arses. \nThats either intentional, or by incapability. Either way, its happening by management.\n\nIt couldn't take too long now, until the novelty focus completely turns away. \nEither thru a clone, or by a competitor with a proprietary system. \n\nCheers",

    "body": "Have you encountered such situation where so many tasks need to be done so you just don't know what to begin with? \n<center>\nhttp://rebootauthentic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/urgent_Vs_important.png\n[source](http://rebootauthentic.com/urgent-vs-important/)\n</center>\n\nFortunately, it happens not so often, but how to manage it? If you know how to solve this hard task - limited time and a plenty of work to do, just skip this post and save your time. Otherwise I would recommend an efficient tool I use myself to cope with it. It is simple, easy to remember and all is required is a sheet of paper and a pen or just good memory\n\n<h4> Eisenhower's matrix (Urgent-Important Matrix)</h4> \n\n> \u201cWhat is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important.\u201d ~ Dwight D. Eisenhower ([source](http://blog.sandglaz.com/the-urgent-important-matrix))\n\nThis mind tool was often used by U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower and later  Dr Stephen Covey told about this effective concept in his famous book \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\" fame) where he called it Urgent-Important Matrix. Look at this picture:\n\n![](https://ansusconsultingblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/eisenhower-matrix.png)\n[source](https://ansusconsultingblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/time-management-4-easy-steps-to-get-things-done-2/)\n\nYou see, it is very easy - the matrix consists of 4 squares and all you need to do is to spread all your tasks into 4 groups according to their importance and urgency.\n\n<h4>Let's look at this simple example:</h4>\n\n<strong>Today I need to: </strong>\n\n- make several posts on Steemit, \n- clean my room (last time it was a week ago), \n- have supper, \n- play War Robots (my favorite android game), \n- help my wife with English \n- and to call my mother and father to get know how they are doing \n- and go to the store to buy some stuff required for today . \n- find an apartment for 2 nights for next weekend trip to another city (Vinnitca, they say there is awesome fountain)\n\nAnd it is 16:00 now.  8 items to be done. So what should I do?\n<hr>\nRight! First of all I choose the most important and most urgent things, that will be \n\n<strong>First square: Important and Urgent</strong> \n\n- go to shop untill it is closed (I really need some stuff for today!)\n- call my parents untill it is not too late\n\nI begin to do it immediatly after my matrix is ready.\n\n<strong>Second square: Not Urgent but still Important</strong> \n\n- clean the room \n- help my wife\n- have supper\n- posts on Steemit (anyway whales are rarely seen according to [catchawhale.com](http://catchawhale.com).\n\nThis also important but I can do it later and I need to do it myself. \nThat's why I proceed with this after all tasks fron first square are done.\n\n<strong>Third square: Not important but still Urgent</strong>\n\n- finding an apartment (It can be a problem if delayed because all good apartments can be already booked after several days)\n\nOh, I can delegate it to my wife! \n\n<strong>Four square: Not Urgent and Not Important </strong>\n\n- playing War Robots\n\nFor current moment I can live without it :) Maybe tomorrow I show them all who is great fighter but not today.\n\nThat's all, guys! I wish you to be successful and productive.Peace.",

    "body": "http://media1.santabanta.com/full1/Animals/Rabbits/rabbits-0a.jpg\n\n\nI have been working on this hypothesis for a while now. I call it the 1 out of 10. \nIt is stated as follows:\nIn the population, about 9 out of 10 people are worthless idiots. \n\nThis is not immutable. It is a general working idea. \nDepending on the group, there will be sometimes less and sometimes more. \nGeorge Carlin said, \u201cthink of how dumb the average person is. \nWell half of them are dumber than that.\u201d \nWith the 1 out of 10 hypothesis, I'm taking it farther than that. \n\nThere are some interesting aspects that arise as a result of applying this idea. \n\n   First, I find, that in applying it to the self, I cannot be certain to which group I belong. \nI know to which group I wish to belong but let's not make any assumptions. \nI know where that leads. \nThere are tests I can take, which will narrow it down. \nIn the end I've found no way to be sure. \nThe only statement I can make is that I would like to belong to the 1 out of 10. \nSo, already, I have provided myself with the inspiration to strive to be something \nother than a worthless idiot. This, in my opinion, is progress. \nIsn't that what most of us want? I don't know, I'm only me. \n\n   Second, this removes the need for inferiority complexes.\nInstead of comparing myself to others, it becomes more useful to compare others to me.\nIf I am not going to find value in 9 out of 10, the methods of search must change.\nGetting lost in the weeds is not entertainment.\n\n   Third, I find that it gets to the heart of the \u201cisms\u201d. \nRacism, sexism et cetera are wiped away the instant I apply the 1 out of 10 hypothesis. \nThe hypothesis tells us that it is not any group that are worthless or dangerous, \nbut, that about 90% of every group are worthless, if not dangerous.  \nAgain, this brings me to the same dilemma. How do I sort out which is which?\n\nThere are metaphors to be found in nature.\nRabbits, for example, most rabbits are what are called, food. \nMaybe 5 or 10 out of 100 are the wily ones, the ones that reproduce.\n\nI do hope this does not come across as overly harsh.\nThe 1 out of 10 that I find of value may bear no relation \nto those that you choose for yourself.\nI am not advocating getting rid of the 9 out of 10.\nThis is more of a match making for friends.\n\nI believe this tack is providing me with useful insights. \nThe more I apply it the more I learn.\nMeans and methods remain to be defined.\n\nIf anyone has any reasonable suggestions, leave a reply. Thank you for your attention.\n\n\n\nimage: media1.santabanta.com",

    "body": "@herpetologyguy\n\nOne of my many tasks as a zoo keeper is connecting people to animals. \n-\n<html>\n\n\n<p>The museum I work at is unique because we showcase animals that are native to Virginia -- meaning that these are animals people will find close to home, rather than across the ocean in some distant country. This makes my job more crucial in that I am responsible for educating people about the reptiles and amphibians that they will find in their own backyards. And obviously, there\u2019s one group of reptiles that gives people more pause than almost any other animal . . . .&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Snakes.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj   &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>I do public programs featuring snakes quite frequently. &nbsp;I believe people should know how to identify local venomous/non-venomous snakes, their role in the environment and how to deal with them when they are in close proximity to our homes. &nbsp;Usually, I get eager audiences asking great questions. &nbsp;But, every now and then, I get some idiot who tells me, \u201cI saw that same snake in my backyard! I chopped off its head with a shovel!\u201d</p>\n<p>Are they an idiot for killing the snake? &nbsp;Not necessarily . . . I don\u2019t know the situation behind the encounter. But, only an idiot would walk into a wildlife facility, approach a zoo keeper and proudly declare that they kill the very same animals that the keeper is charged with the care for. &nbsp;Would you walk into an animal shelter and tell someone working there that you enjoy stomping on puppies? &nbsp;To us, there\u2019s not much difference\u2026&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com\">Credit</a>\n</p>\n<p>The best we can do in these situations is to try to educate people. This can be difficult because so many people are set in their ways -- plus we have to combat an instinctive fear and prejudice against snakes. &nbsp;So, I\u2019m going to briefly lay it all out for you and tell you \"<em><strong>Why you shouldn\u2019t kill that snake in your yard.</strong></em>\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s ILLEGAL in most states to kill a wild snake, unless that snake presents an IMMEDIATE threat.</strong></em> &nbsp;And no, a snake crawling through your yard does not represent a good enough excuse to use force. &nbsp;We\u2019re talking about a situation where a venomous snake is about to strike and you have no escape route but to fight your way out. &nbsp;And guess what, that really doesn\u2019t ever happen (barring instances where someone purposefully provokes an animal). &nbsp;Wildlife and law enforcement agencies are cracking down on people killing snakes, so it\u2019s better to keep yourself out of trouble.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>2. &nbsp;<em><strong>You are putting yourself in harm\u2019s way. &nbsp;</strong></em>The vast majority of snake bites occur when people attempt to capture or kill snakes. &nbsp;If left alone, the snake CANNOT hurt you. &nbsp;Call wildlife services or trained professionals to remove the animal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>3. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s an incredibly beneficial animal, and you\u2019d be foolish to kill it.</strong></em> &nbsp;Small snakes eat a huge variety of pest insects that destroy gardens, while large snakes typically feed on rats and other rodents that infest our homes. &nbsp;If you see a large snake hanging around, you have a rodent problem; snakes will not hang around if there is no food source. &nbsp;To keep snakes from being attracted to your property, do your best to remove any shelter or food sources that would attract rodents. &nbsp;Some snakes even eat other snakes, and species like the harmless king snake will even feed on venomous species!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImOj1CKTBqE\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>4. &nbsp;<em><strong>Another snake might show up.</strong></em> &nbsp;Snakes will not typically inhabit the same area in order to avoid competition. &nbsp;If you kill that harmless rat snake, but you still have a food source nearby, another snake may move in to make use of that source. &nbsp;The new snake may be another harmless species or something a bit less desirable. &nbsp;So why not let that harmless snake take care of the infestation for you?</p>\n<p>http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>Having a snake around can be hugely beneficial to you. &nbsp;It is a free, environmentally-safe form of pest control. &nbsp;Snakes, including venomous species, are non-aggressive animals (unless you provoke them) that will actively do their best to AVOID people. &nbsp;A resident snake will often go unnoticed by homeowners, and most encounters are fleeting glimpses of the snake making a hasty escape. &nbsp;Remember that snakes have their own unique role in the environment, and regardless of our own fears and feelings towards them, they are a necessary part of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg &nbsp; <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org\">Credit</a></p>\n</html>\n\nif you liked this also please check out:\nhttps://steemit.com/science/@herpetologyguy/what-are-herptiles-indentifying-reptiles-vs-amphibians\n\n\n***don't forget to follow @herpetologyguy***",

While I didn't get to read or see the article until someone mailed me a physical copy, I found out that my article had started a number of discussions and follow-on commentary.\n\nDuring my stay at Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp I observed many economic theories put into effect by inmates and the prison administration, including Gresham's law, hyperinflation, currency exchange, and others.\n\nThere are two markets in prison, the \"Administration Run Market\" (ARM) and the \"Inmate Run Market\" (IRM). \n\nFor the ARM, family and friends can add money to your account through Western Union, MoneyGram, or mailing a check. These funds get added to your account fairly quickly and can be used almost immediately, however with a strict spending limit. You get 300 minutes of phone use per month for about $70, and email costs about $0.05 a minute and is only available at specific times to specific people. Once a week you can shop in the commissary with a $360 a month spending limit. Further, certain products have limits of how much you can buy, for example the Mackerel (described below). Alternatively, the IRM is where you can buy sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, Italian ices, hire a personal trainer, get a haircut, pay someone to clean your cube, repair a watch, even inmate run caterers for your birthday or going home party. Additionally there were inmate run 'stores' which sold commissary items at a markup since you could only commissary shop once a week.\n\n[![mackerel-203x300.png](https://s18.postimg.org/pkn7zm1h5/mackerel_203x300.png)](https://postimg.org/image/iu6qq6eb9/)\n\nThe Mackerel (meaning literal packets of fish) is one of the competing currencies in the IRM. It has utility by being one of the best sources of protein on the compound. You can save it for a long time, the shelf life is a few years. The price is relatively the same across all prisons in the country, so even if you transfer prisons your property comes with you, including your Mackerel which is worth the same somewhere else. Unlike tunafish, chicken packets and protein bars, more people eat Mackerel. Those other food items can be used as currency as well, for example the guy who fixes your watch may only accept protein bars because he hates fish. There was even a form of digital currency being used, which I will discuss in another post.\n\n[![pzyQaHU.png](https://s15.postimg.org/tggsqn3uj/pzy_Qa_HU.png)](https://postimg.org/image/nfj3tkh87/)\n\nUtility and medium of exchange give it some value but what about scarcity ? If there is a virtually unlimited amount of Mackerel in the IRM, just like the Federal Reserve printing money, there is no scarcity and hyperinflation can occure if it is debased. \n\nUsing a simple equation, 467 (Number of Inmates) * 14 (Maximum Quantity Allowed to Purchase Per Inmate) * 52 (weeks, assuming every inmate buys the maximum mount of Mackerel every week)\n\nSo if in 2015 we assume that the Supply and Velocity grows at the exact same rate with the Price Level and Transactions unchanging, the amount of Mackerel would essentially double on an even inflation rate. This does not factor in the 3 year shelf life, where expired Mackerel becomes a secondary currency. I will discuss in my next post. \n\nI like to believe that the value of money is determined also psychological factors, like a commodity and not only by mechanical or mathematical factors. In prison many of these psychological factors come into play.\n\n[![1867-1967-Ten-10\u00a2-Cents-Commemorative-Centennial.jpg](https://s15.postimg.org/yqgpkthrv/1867_1967_Ten_10_Cents_Commemorative_Centennial.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/ceiwrfinr/)\n\nMost people use Mackerel as a day-to-day currency for normal transactions, but for reasons I will explain in my next post, they are not the best long term store of value which is important for a currency. For longer term store of value, many inmates use stamps. Stamps have a set rate by the United States Postal Service and have similar characteristics as Mackerel aside for being edible. However, with the introduction of email on the compound many people stopped writing letters as email is cheaper and faster therefore reducing stamps ability to be a transactional currency as a majority of the inmates have no use for them. As a store of value they still hold weight because they are small and easy to store large amounts, while Mackerel is not.\n\nThe biggest value stamps have is that they can be mailed home and your family can redeem them for dollars as the local post office, but that feature can be stopped by better mail screening and overnight the stamp could lose its store of value utility. \n\nIn my next post I will discuss how currency exchangers work, what happens when the prison administration purposely floods the market, and how a secondary currency was created out of expired Mackerel called \u201cMoney Maks\u201d",

Shame on every one of the whales that upvoted it and all of the previous posts. Thousands of SBD have been thrown away on this and other fake accounts. The question is - do these whales know it? Are they actively scamming the platform themselves?\"\n\nBy this point, I suppose many of you realize that the account of @msgivings was not run by a human, but rather by artificial intelligence. If you take the time to actually read all the posts that @msgivings wrote, you'll notice some really odd cognitive dissonance. I could tell when I read just one of those posts that a real woman was not writing it. But I too, didn't really look into this account until fairly recently, because I was turned off by the clickbait nature of the titles. I ignored reading them until @yogi.artist pointed out that it's AI. \n\nThe Msgivings Robot has so far banked around $16,000 in blogging rewards from Steemit, and no one realized it until fairly recently. I think @bacchist and @reneenouveau may have been the first ones to reveal this AI hidden identity, but it was [@yogi.artist's post](https://steemit.com/steem/@yogi.artist/the-importance-of-physical-appearance-in-society-featuring-new-ai-author-mstakings) that truly opened my eyes to the high level that AI writing software programs have recently reached. He affectionately refers to Msgivings as \"Mstakings\". Another user has claimed that more than 1% of the high-paying trending articles are being written by AI, not real humans.\n\nWhat seals the deal for me personally, in verifying that the @msgivings account was AI is the fact that the account owner has vaporized. A real human would of course defend themselves and fight for their reputation, account and future in Steemit. Owners of AI scam accounts pack up and leave, respin their identity, respin their articles and try again, knowing that most of the whales don't really scrutinize the articles to any meaningful degree.\n\nI was examining the @msgivings account very thoroughly today and noticed that @msgivings had voted for @mibenkito and followed this account a few weeks ago. I then began reading that blog and noticed that @mibenkito had never bothered to write an \"Introduce Yourself\" post. I read every single one of the posts, and not one contained a photo with the standard holding of a \"Steemit\" sign. Odd, for sure. But the oddest thing to me was that in the introduction post, the very first line starts out like this:\n\n>\"I\u2019m an Asian and I live to eat.\"\n\nI lived in Asia and have a degree in Japanese. One of the things I immediately noticed when I lived in Japan is that Asian people rarely describe themselves as \"Asian\". In fact, in all my time spent living in Asia, I never heard one Asian refer to themselves as \"Asian.\" Koreans call themselves Koreans, Japanese call themselves Japanese, etc. Only people who are non-Asian refer to them as Asians. At least that has been my experience so far in life. There may be Asians who call themselves Asian, but I've never met them. \n\nSo, this first sentence feels really awkward and unusual for the reasons I listed above. The English contained in these posts is very strange, but not in a way that suggests it's written by a non-native English speaker. I was an English teacher in Japan and so I'm very familiar with how Japanese people write English. The English that was written in @mibenkito ranges from advanced English skills, with proper usage of commas, to low English usage. It's a strange and odd mix of levels. The first post is truly odd. I have been exposed to a lot of different English styles that were written by non-native English speakers and I've never come across such an odd and patchy style of writing. \n\n<center>![robot-707219_128024562.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/robot-707219_128024562.jpg)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay\n\nI am not saying that this account is AI, but it does contain rather inconsistent aspects, namely, that we do not know who @mibenkito is. Usually, on Steemit, people want to share their unique perspective, and they usually tell us where they are from originally, instead of just saying, \"I'm Asian.\" That's like me saying, \"I'm North American.\" Let's face it, no one says it. This all could be cleared up quite fast with a video or a standard introduce yourself post, complete with a Steemit sign.\n\nThis is not meant to be some kind of inquisition, but seeing as how the Steemit community paid out $16,000 to a robot whose owner has abandoned the platform, it's in our best interest to question the identity of posters, especially ones which are receiving massive payouts.\n\nThe word on the street from professional writers is that Steemit is attracting greedy scammers. And unfortunately, the quality is just not up to par yet with Medium. When whale voters, and the curation projects that dole out their funds don't take a close look at what they're voting on, we arrive in the situation of a robot making over $16,000. And now that robot is no where to be seen. The owner of @msgivings has abandoned his/her account. \n\n# The owner that created @msgivings could easily be making new accounts to fool gullible humans. \n\nThe thought process is going probably something like this: \"Well, I've exhausted that msgivings persona, so now I  can create a different persona, with different hobbies and interests, and as long as I fool the whale curation bots for a while, I'm good. I'll just take out the funds anyway.\"\n\n# I think we all deserve to know who was behind the @msgivings account. \n\n<center>![pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg)</center>\n\nThe proper thing to do would be to just come forward and tell the truth. **Describe the entire process, in all its gritty details.** Describe your elation when you discovered that an AI writing program could make you thousands of dollars. Explain what program you used, how you got it, and what other platforms you're currently using it on. Is this a freelance operation, and Steemit was just your highest paid client? What is the story behind this deception? \n\n# If you were really clever, you could write a book about this, throw it up on Amazon, and see more profits roll in. But you'd have to tell the truth first here on Steemit. \n\nCould you tell the truth? Is that even in your wheelhouse? What kind of human are you anyway? I think the people who you've incited, people who engaged with you for weeks, wrote lengthy comments, deserve to know the truth. Are you capable of telling the truth? Or do you operate on some other plane of deceptive existence? This is all really interesting and would make a fantastic book. Maybe I'll be the one to write the book and interview you anonymously at some point in the future. Would you do that? Would you offer up your true story anonymously? The questions keep coming, _WHO ARE YOU MSGIVINGS_?\n\n<center>![head-663997_128076d7e.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/head-663997_128076d7e.jpg)</center>\nImage Source: pixabay\n\n# Moving forward. \n\nWhat if all of us mere mortals adapted to this new AI technology, like most of us will be doing soon enough, and began using our own AI programs to generate content? What exactly would be the point of Steemit? Would the robot wars really move into high gear then? Would the advanced AI writing programs be winner take all? The only real interaction would be found in the comments, but an AI could be trained in that capacity, too.\n\nWhat is Steemit's official stance on AI-created content moving forward? How about, as long as it's clearly indicated that the content was created by artificial intelligence? But you and I know this is a silly utopian fantasy. Big profits won't come to those who transparently reveal that they are using AI to generate articles.\n\nAn what would be the point of humans upvoting a software writing program? Is a program more valuable than a human? Should we all become robot shepherds and get our own AI writing programs? What is the point of any of this? If AI takes over the trending pages, then what role will humans have here in Steemit? Will we become expert commenters and video creators, letting AI programs do the bulk of the arduous writing?\n\nI am not against AI and even I considered making an AI account that would be a robot twin of my writing. But I would properly identify it as AI using the sticker that @reneenouveau created, so that deception would not be a part of my deal. \n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/100bot.gif\n\nYou see, when you deceive others, you finally are forced to abandon your account. Why not create an AI account and do it transparently, with the entire community aware that it was created using AI? I have loads of questions about these AI programs, and I'm also looking to get my own soon. Or would that finally open the pandora's box that's waiting to happen? \n\n# Is that the singularity that everyone is talking about? Or has it already arrived?\n\n# The real problem doesn't lie within AI. The real problem lies within the deceptive human mind who is controlling AI.\n\n<center>![cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay",

    "body": "<center>![imaged23a9.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imaged23a9.jpg)</center>\n\nShe went inside the motel and a giant orca with Swedish horns and an unnerving laugh told her it would cost 30 Steem Dollars for the night. Minnow hadn't thought too much about money but she remembered she\u2019d set up a free account at the Fishbank earlier. She opened her account booklet and discovered that there were already three deposits in it which totally surprised her. \n\n## 10 Steem dollars was from the _Nerd Shepherd,_ 10 was from the donkey-eared tuna and 10 was from the tiny clam that she helped get unstuck from a crevice. She had exactly the correct amount to stay at the motel. \n\nThe big Swedish orca gave her room keys and told her that funny songs and videos played on channel 3. But the orca also told her that if she watched the videos, she would have to pay an extra fee. \n\nMinnow thanked him and quickly retired to her room for the night. She couldn't watch the videos because she had run out of money. \n\n# In the morning she was shocked awake by the big orca's booming voice and bangings on her door. He said she had slept 10 minutes over the checkout time and that she now owed him an extra five Steem dollars. \n\nShe told him that she didn't understand and that she was not aware she had to check out at a certain time. She gathered up her things and told the orca she was sorry but that she didn't have anymore money right now. The orca started screaming and cussing her out, calling her a \u201cBucking Fishfitch!\u201d and a \u201cCucking Spotted Funt!\u201d \n\n<center>![image01442.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image01442.jpg)</center>\n\nWithout wasting a millisecond, Minnow swam as fast as she could away from the angry orca, gasping for breath, adrenalin pouring into her veins, helping her harness whale-like strength and speed. That was certainly the last time she would be staying at the Swedish motel.\n\nAfter she calmed down a bit, she remembered that she was supposed to be in school. She knew her parents and her classmates might be worried about her. She also knew she might be in trouble but she was just having way too many adventures and couldn't see any good reason to leave the cave yet. \u00a0Plus, she hadn\u2019t found the Octopus yet. And she hadn't figured out the meaning of the shimmering whale's symbols.  There were too many mysteries needing to be solved. \n\n# Instead of going back to her school, she decided to go in search of the Octopus. She saw more unusual creatures on her way to the Octopus\u2019 lair. \n\n<center>![image8c4b7.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image8c4b7.jpg)</center>\n\n# Then a very small Fangfish appeared out of nowhere. \n\nMinnow instinctively knew to dart away from him for his face was dark and scary and had two long, skinny fangs hanging from each corner of his mouth. As she was almost in the clear, the Fangfish made a quick dash for her and one of his fangs pierced her metallic scale, ripping it off. The flesh underneath the absent scale began to bleed and sting. As she swam away, she briefly looked behind her. She watched the Fangfish slither away, back into his dark hole in the seabed, her shredded metallic green scale clinging to the corner of his hideous mouth.\n\n# After her close call she immediately took notice of another small fish who was waving hello to her. She recognized his scales because they were from the same school as hers. \n\nThe small fish approach Minnow and said, \u201cHello there. You may not know me, but I know you. I saw you leave our school and I decided to follow you here. You do good work and I'd like to help you with your mission. I also saw the complex structure that the shimmering whale was building. I don't yet understand all the symbols, but I figured out the meaning of a few of them.\u201d\n\n<center>![imagedbc7b.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imagedbc7b.jpg)</center>\n\nMinnow said, \u201cFintastic! I'm so glad you found me because it was awfully lonely in here. I'm really excited to hear what you discovered about those complex whale symbols, too. Hey do you want to come with me to find the Octopus? Have you visited her yet? That's where I'm headed right now.\u201d\n\nThe small fish whose name was Data replied, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t found the Octopus yet, either. Let's go together!\u201d\n\n# So Minnow and Data swam on in search of the Octopus. After many twists and turns they finally arrived at the sunken ship. They entered the ship and immediately saw a purple tentacle greet them. \n\n\u201cI've been waiting for both of you,\u201d said the Octopus.\n\nMinnow replied, \u201dThank you for welcoming us here.\u201d Data also expressed his gratitude.\n\nOctopus led them to a lavish guest room and they all sat down and were served tea and crumpets by a little blue crab.\n\nThe Octopus pointed her long tentacle to a window and told Minnow and Data to look out. They saw huge stretches of tiny fish waiting in long lines for the whales\u2019 soup. Many fish were waving signs that read _**\u201cPLEASE READ AND FEED ME\u201d**_ and they were kneeling on their fins begging for attention from any creature who happened to pass by.\n\n<center>![imagedda2e.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imagedda2e.jpg)</center>\n\nThe Octopus looked Minnow and Data dead in the eyes and said, \n\n# \u201cDo not do as they do. Do not beg. Do not make yourself less than you are. The cave will not benefit if you think small. Take these electric black swan amulets and wear them every day around your necks from now on. As long as you show the amulets gratitude and pay attention to your dreamworld, they will guide you to the internal treasures. But the day you take your amulets for granted or start ignoring your dreamworld, is the day your external and internal treasures will begin to fade away. Go now. I have nothing more to say to you both.\u201d\n\n<center>![imageffed2.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imageffed2.jpg)</center>\n\n........TO BE CONTINUED\n\n[Part 1 is here](https://steemit.com/steemit/@stellabelle/minnow-and-data-a-steemit-tale-part-1)\n\nALL ART AND STORY BY STELLABELLE.

    "body": "<center>![imagedce5b.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imagedce5b.jpg)</center>\n\n# Once there was a little fish named Minnow who lived in the open ocean with her brothers and sisters. \n\n<center>![image46b82.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image46b82.jpg)</center>\n\nOne day Minnow accidentally got separated from her school because she followed a transparent jellyfish into an unknown area of the sea. She hadn't taken notice of where she was going because she had become mesmerized by the unusual, gem-like tentacles of the strange jellyfish. She had never seen anything like it before. When the jellyfish suddenly disappeared, she realized she was lost. The familiar blue waters were now solid black and she had no idea how to get back to her school or even what part of the sea she was in. She had never ventured into the dark sea before.\n\n## Even though she was afraid, she was also curious and she decided to make the most of her time away from her school. \n\nShe decided to let her curiosity run free, really free while she was lost. School was so boring and she was tired of obeying her teachers\u2019 unnecessary rules. It was time for an adventure.\n\n# Within a few minutes she came upon a group of unusual and colorful creatures who were hanging around the entrance of a cave.\n\n<center>![imageaeb0f.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imageaeb0f.jpg)</center>\n\nAs she swam past them she said in a cheerful tone, \"Greetings fine creatures.\u201d All the creatures replied in unison \"Greetings.\u201d \n\n# Then Minnow asked, \u201cIs it safe to go into this cave?\u201d\n\n<center>![image44b78.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image44b78.jpg)</center>\n\nThe blue fancy fish replied, \u201cYes, it is, but beware of the Pufferfish, Fangfish and the Ganglion. Before you do anything though, you should go find the Octopus. She lives in the big sunken ship that's just around the corner from the entrance of the cave.\u201d\n\nMinnow replied, \u201c OK, thank you.\u201d\n\nBut instead of going in search of the Octopus like the blue fish advised, Minnow decided to just have a look around the cave first. Immediately, she noticed a tiny clam who was stuck in a crevice and she helped him get out of it.\n\n# Then she noticed a giant shimmering whale building some sort of elaborate and complex floating structure. All over the structure were unknown symbols and formulas which very few fish understood.\n\n<center>![image1a1df.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image1a1df.jpg)</center>\n\nUpon seeing the whale, Minnow suddenly felt so small and insignificant. She looked down at her own tiny fins that were plain and green and wished that she too would someday be as big and complex as the shimmering whale.\n\nAfter a little reflection, she cast aside her feelings of insignificance and began feeling curious again. She was really interested in the complex structure that the whale was building. She took a few pictures of the unknown symbols on the structure while the whale wasn't looking. She wanted to study them later on and ask others if they knew what the symbols meant.\n\nRight across from the shimmering well was a fishbank where a sign outside said **FREE ACCOUNTS.** Minnow decided to go there first and open an account since she had practically nothing in her school account.\n\nAfter her account had been set up, she looked at the photos of the unknown symbols. **They were driving her nuts.** \u201cWhat do they mean?\u201d She decided to go searching for the meaning of the symbols right then.\n\n<center>![image8d835.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image8d835.jpg)</center>\n\n# She knew that the shimmering whale had the answers to the symbols, but she was too scared to ask him directly. He was so big, so powerful, so shimmering and he seemed too busy.\n\nShe decided to go exploring more of the cave. She ran into more whales, orcas, trout, sharks and dolphins. Some of the whales were busy mining transparent goo inside of rocks. After they mined this clear goo substance from the rocks, they formed the goo into blocks. They had to wear special glasses to see the goo. Then they slapped a sign onto each block which read, BLOCK # 1, 2, 3, etc. Then they attached a chain to the blocks of goo which connected the first block to the second, and so forth. \n\n<center>![image71e3c.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image71e3c.jpg)</center>\n\n# But then something magical happened at the precise time the chain got attached to the block of transparent goo. \n\nThe block of goo replicated itself a hundred times instantaneously, like a jellyfish releasing its clones, and these flew at the speed of light to all the different whale miners. This was to ensure that each block of goo was created with precision and also it ensured that no whale miner went rogue. \n\n<center>![image63db4.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image63db4.jpg)</center>\n\n# \u201cWow!\u201d Minnow thought to herself, realizing she\u2019d found a place of pure magic.\n\nThen she left the whale miners and continued on exploring the cave.\n\nAt this point she noticed it was getting blacker the further she went in the cave. She began to feel alone and very small.\n\n<center>![image121a9.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image121a9.jpg)</center>\n\nShe had no blocks to mine, no structures to build, no friends in this strange new cave world. Then she happened to notice a large tuna sitting at a desk writing in a large book.\n\n# The tuna was happily writing away. He had strange floppy donkey ears instead of regular fish ears and this made Minnow laugh. Minnow was really amused by the tuna\u2019s donkey ears and she swam over to get a closer look. \n\n<center>![image8a365.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/image8a365.jpg)</center>\n\nMinnow said to the tuna, \u201cI love your donkey ears. How did you get them?\u201d\n\nThe tuna replied in a deep voice, \u201cThe _Nerd Shepherd_ gave them to me when I entered the cave four weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nThe tuna replied, \u201cBecause I offered to write this book for him.\u201d\n\nMinnow then said, \u201cOh, I write every day, too, but I write for selfish badgers. Is there anything I can do to help you write that book? If you need any help writing, please let me know. I love this cave so far and I'd like to help you if I can.\u201d\n\nThe donkey-eared tuna replied, \u201cOK, I'll keep you in mind. Thanks for the offer.\u201dAnd the tuna continued writing his book at his dimly lit desk.\n\n# Minnow swam on and it was now quite late. She was getting sleepy, so she decided it would be best to find a safe place for the night instead of venture out of the cave at that late hour. \n\nAs she was swimming she began to hear funny Swedish music and a very deep and deceptive voice booming through the water. She then saw a giant bright and glowing Swedish hat and a sign underneath that said, VACANCY.\n\n\u201cAhhh, a Swedish motel!\u201d She had no idea what a Swedish motel was, but it sounded good to her tired fishbones.\n\nShe went inside the motel and a giant orca with Swedish horns and an unnerving laugh told her it would cost 30 Steem Dollars for the night. \n\n<center>![imageb54d8.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/imageb54d8.jpg)</center>\n\n## [CLICK HERE FOR PART 2](https://steemit.com/steemit/@stellabelle/minnow-and-data-a-steemit-tale-part-2)\n\nALL ART AND STORY CREATED BY STELLABELLE.

Alone with our dog, Ruby. She\u2019s a Shih, Tzu. You know, that small yappy breed with long hair and eyes like Igor in Young Frankenstein. Every so often, Ruby sniffs my foot and tugs my ankle bracelet. It\u2019s not the kind my dad manufactures in his jewelry business. My bracelet beeps when the batteries go low. It\u2019s beeping now. Ruby hates the noise. She\u2019s barking like crazy, attacking my foot. I better recharge before the Feds get angry. I lost my company. Then, I got strip-searched in JFK and lost my freedom.*\n\nI'm not the best of singers, but I hope you enjoy ! \n\nDownload: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5v080hwwtwnai1b/FlippinOut2.mp3\n\n'Free Shrem' T-Shirt below can be purchased here: http://www.7bucktees.com/shop/free-charlie-shrem-t-shirt/ \n\n>Tell me if I'm wrong, but it happens a lot\nThey get scared at things once they get hot\nWe now know it's a recurring theme\nWhat happened to the American dream ?\nI turned around to see what that could be ?\nNext thing that happens I'm a detainee, agents\nAnd they yell and shriek\nNow I haven't seen my girlfriend\nIn one whole week\n\n>I start to think that things are looking bad\nIn prison they gave me a writing pad\nHere comes my legal team, they're set ting bail\nPlease god help, I'll never survive in jail\nAnd now I'm thinking that I'm fed to sharks\nAgainst the wall, yeh they are throwin darts, fear\nAnd maybe sadness too\nNow let me take a good look at you!\n\n>I'm flipping out\nAnd my parents are sweating bullets\nI'm flipping out\nAnd my I'm counting down the minutes.\n\n>From the early on, Bitcoin was on the frontier\nWe decided to change the way we've lived for thousands of years\nWe fought with experts that they're incorrect\nWell what fees and middlemen, and a little respect?\nI ask the judge \"Am I ever going home?\"\nBut he just looks and says you should have known\nBecause laws, are here to protect our freedom\nI got my axe and spear and shield to fight in the coliseum\n\n>No more parties, I'm banned from cities\nNo more court and work, can it get more shitty\nNow its only friends and the neighbroohod guys\nTo go outside I must call the FBI\nI'm going crazy, yeh I'm on my way\nJust gotta learn all those crash phrases that I'll need to say\nLike Bitcoin, and I love you\nCause I know if I don't say it we won't get through!\n\n>I'm flipping out\u2026\nAnd I never shave my face\nCause I'm too scared of this case\nAnd I'll never take a shower\nCause in prison being large is power\nAnd my parents are sweating bullets\nAnd my I'm counting down the minutes.\nAnd my parents are sweating bullets\nAnd my I'm counting down the minutes.\nAnd my parents are sweating bullets\nAnd my I'm counting down the minutes.\nAnd now I'm starting to choke\nHey! I wish for just one more toke\n\nThis song is based on Flippin Out by Blue Fringe \n\n[![2014-01-31 15.39.05.jpg](https://s12.postimg.org/40nmqkdjx/2014_01_31_15_39_05.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/pab91etuh/)",

Click my name to follow me and check out my blog for the Preamble and Parts 1-4. All names are changed to protect inmates privacy.*\n\n*I apologize for the delay in posting Part 5. I have been a little under the weather this week, which is probably being brought on by stress as my full release is this Friday. If you are in South Florida, I will be speaking next week followed by a dinner. Would love to see fellow Steemers! http://meetup.com/Tampa-Bay-Bitcoineers/events/233921902/*\n\n**Unit Life**\n\n> Bang bang bang \n\nAll day and night I hear this banging on the Unit windows. \n\n> Bang bang bang \n\nIt's the inmate signal that a CO is entering the unit, wether it be 5am or 5pm there is always an inmate lookout shift watching all corners of the unit. When a CO is coming up the road and entering the building, everyone knows. It's not a full proof system though, and I see inmates being dragged out all the time. There is no point in resisting. Once they know you are a trouble maker, it's only a matter of time before they catch you. \n\nYou have to get lucky every night, they only have to get lucky once. \n\nThus is Unit Life as I'm starting to learn. \n\nI've been in prison a few weeks now and even though I'm getting into a routine, it's not easier. I wake up every morning, go to the bathroom and brush my teeth. I try to wake up earlier than everyone as I like to move slowly but this is impossible, inmates are always awake. There are some inmates that work the midnight sift in the powerhouse or early morning cleaning the wardens office. Some older folk just like being awake early. Most of the guys who stay up all night, generally the younger ones, are sleeping until midday. I like hanging around the older guys. I keep my voice low, like having good conversation and have a long term outlook on life.\n\nMost inmates can be categorized into two categories: Long term and short term. No, I'm not talking about the length of their sentence, I'm talking about their outlook on life. Many inmates care about today and tomorrow. They are going to hustle and make every day their best with no care for tomorrow. They will make trouble, eat what they want and not give two shits about their fellow human being. There is no way to rationalize with these inmates, they do whatever the hell they want to do and thats about it. Other inmates care. Meaning, they give some level of respect to other human beings. This could be sharing a cookie or something simple like wiping their piss of the toilet seat \n\n[![Benton jail.jpg](https://s14.postimg.org/kz5wafoyp/Benton_jail.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/xqk2gxyql/)\n\nLater that year when I was in solitary, I briefly had a bunk mate who told me he was sent there because he jumped his other bunkie. He had woken to use the bathroom and his bunkie hadn't wiped down the seat. You can get stabbed for something like that. \n\nAfter I do my bathroom thing, I go back to my cube and try not to wake up Omar. Omar works at UNICOR aka Prison Industries. This is the highest paying job on the compound, starting at $0.17 an hour. They do everything from breaking down old VCR's to doing the upholstery on furniture. When you walk into a government office, wether it be the post office or federal building, all the furniture and plastic silverware is made by UNICOR. Usually the inmates who work at UNICOR don't have outside money coming in, they can bring home $100-$300 a month which goes a long way in the commissary. \n\n[![products-landing-page.jpg](https://s14.postimg.org/y21itpf6p/products_landing_page.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/k8d64nml9/)\n\nIt's almost impossible to open up my locker without it creaking. I grab my coffee cup to make my morning Shrempresso. What is a Shrempresso you ask? From my love of all things coffee I've invented a mixture that is making its way around the compound. Over the next year, dozens of inmates will have drank my Shrempresso \n\n**Shrempresso Receipe**\n\n- Get a 16 oz cup, don't fill it with water yet! \n- Add 1 tsp of the following to your cup\n*1. Maxwell House Instant Espresso (Dark Roast if you can find it)\n*2. Keefe Colombian Coffee (Not sure if you can buy this outside of a Prison Compound)\n*3. Swiss Mix Hot Chocolate \n- Add hot water and stir! \n\nAfter I make my Shrempresso I head into the TV room to watch the news. \n\nThe TV room is where you will find hostilities and violence, if any, on the compound. There are actually 2 TV rooms, both with 3 TVs hanging from the ceiling. Each TV has an FM frequency under it and you can tune your mp3 player or radio to listen in. Having a seat is based on seniority. The only way to get a seat is if someone who is leaving gives you theirs. However if the other inmates don't think you are worthy, they won't respect your seat and someone will likely always be sitting in it. Shimi has been on the compound for 3 years and lets me sit in his seat when he is not around. The control over which channel and shows are on is based on super seniority and unless you are living in the Unit 5+ years, don't even try to change the channel. If there is a fight, it usually happens outside the TV room because if someone does something in the TV room, we all lose it. \n\nRespect the sanctity of the TV room, or leave. \n\n[![religion-prison_sentence-prison-jail-prisoner-se.jpg](https://s16.postimg.org/gqz9cwtth/religion_prison_sentence_prison_jail_prisoner_se.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/d7dbn3r3l/)\n\nI head back to my cube to get dressed and have a chat with Omar. Sometimes we discuss life, politics, religion or anything over a hunny bun. He was raised in a very religious Muslim family and I was raised in an Orthodox Jewish one, so our conversations always lead to religion and middle eastern politics. Over the year, Omar and I have solved the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and have figured out a way for Muslims and Jews to live in world peace. All it takes is forcing a Muslim and Jew to live together for a year. \n\nConversations would usually start by me asking him about something in Islam that I had heard about and didn't understand, for example his view on homosexuality. He would explain to me that he was raised learning that being Gay is a choice and that we have control of our urges. Then he would explain to me that he has many Gay friends and regardless of his beliefs he does not judge them for it. I would explain the view of Homosexuality in the Torah (Old Testament) regards Gay sex as something we shouldn't do however over the years different Rabbinical authorities have clarified this based on the community you belong to. We would debate various subjects back and forth and it would stay amicable. This relationship allowed the Jewish and Muslim communities in prison to share resources like the chapel, kitchen and each others religious ceremonies and restrictions. \n\nFor breakfast, I can either make myself some oatmeal in the Unit or head to the chow hall. The chow hall is usually corn grits, bran cereal or something resembling oatmeal on a cycle. Sometimes there is a fruit involved and if were lucky maybe a piece of cake. \n\nAfter this I call Courtney to say good morning and head over to the computers to check any emails I got overnight. I park myself in the library and read the newspaper or a book until I head to work.\n\n A week ago I got a job in the education department, as a GED tutor which is the equivalent of a high school diploma. I will discuss that in my next post. \n\nFollow me and stay tuned for Part 6!",

The elected witnesses opted to stay on version 0.13.0 until we could make the necessary changes.   \n\nWe are happy to report that [Steem 0.14.1](https://github.com/steemit/steem/releases) is now available.  Assuming the supermajority of the elected witnesses upgrade by **Tuesday, 20 Sep 2016 15:00:00 UTC** the new features will take effect. These features include: Escrow, Savings, Steem Dollar stability, and more.  Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/steemit/steem/releases/tag/v0.14.1) for more details.\n\n## Hardfork Process \nA hardfork is a change in the business logic that powers Steem. The Steem network has many checks and balances to ensure everything is vetted by a decentralized group of trusted (elected) individuals before taking effect.  No hardfork will take effect until at least 67% of the active witnesses have upgraded to 0.14.1 and it will take effect no earlier than Tue, 20 Sep 2016 15:00:00 UTC.  \n\nJust because Steemit, Inc releases a new version of code does not mean that everyone is *forced* to upgrade to the new code.  It is this review process that caused our prior release (0.14.0) to be rejected by the witnesses.   \n\nOnce a supermajority of active witnesses upgrade the hardfork takes effect at the appointed time.  Steemit, Inc attempts to give all parties ample time to upgrade their machines so that the changeover is seamless.  Any exchanges that do not upgrade will automatically be taken offline by the existing consensus logic.  Assuming everything works as designed there will never be a minority fork created by 0.13.0 nodes.  \n\n## Voting Power Algorithm Unchanged \n\nDue to feedback from the community we have decided to exclude changes in how voting power is determined.  It is clear that we did not communicate our intentions nor the expected result in a way that everyone can get behind. \n\nIt is still our desire to rebalance the voting power to maximize the influence ordinary users have relative to automated users. We intend to document and communicate our enhanced solutions.  \n\n## Thank You\n\nWe would like to thank everyone who is helping to review the code, catch bugs, and submit pull requests.  It is a pleasure to work with such an engaged community.",

If it is possible for you to create a post every day it would be really nice. I highly recommend you do so, try get your best posts out during this promotion time\n\n**Step 2:** Join steemit.chat and search for channel \"#thefollowers\", post me your links to your articles please this makes it easier for me to put them in. I will find them even if you don't put the links up in the channel. \n\nThe channel is open for everyone. So if you want to help out a bit by upvoting I would love it.\n\n**Step 3:** Each of your posts will be promoted and if there are any comments on my posts about/for your posts feel free to reply. \n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIn the list pick I will be writing a few words about you and your work. If you have any other questions fell free to ask. If you like some of the other guys work support them too. I would like to create a huge network of authors that can support each other",

You will get selected based on you previous work as well as your activity on the platform. \n\n**Rules:** only authors under 150 followers will be placed in this pick. Any form of plagiarism will disqualify you from getting picked (Special cases may apply). This will only apply to you if you have a consistent change and approval from the steemit community. If at anytime your work during the promoted week is plagiarised, you will be removed from the list/promotion and receive flags on you plagiarised work. \n\nI will not take any submissions, for those of you that want to get noticed (have me look at your work) you may drop a link to your profile below in the comment section(the abuse and spamming of this, from the same person, will get flagged).\n\nThe list:\n---------\n\nAll rules apply to this and the list is not set and can get changed. \n**Changing the list:** once the list is presented, those on the list may still get removed (not receive promotion). This will only be done by the community, if you feel that a person should not be promoted then comment below. I will then have a look and if your reason is valid for removing a name from the list that person will not be promoted.\n\n**Those on the list:** for those on the list, their work created the week during promotion will be promoted everyday for 5days, till Saturday. \n\n5 day promotion:\n---------------\n\n**Posts by authors:** all the posts by the authors will be promoted everyday and by day 5 all the posts which they have posted within the 5 days will be up. You will be able to look at all their work and follow them if you love them. This will also increase the value of some of their posts similar to the hidden gem pick.\n\nThe aim of this project:\n-----------------------\n\nThe daily gems aim was to get amazing posts seen... this didn't help much in the end as I was just one post every now and then. The aim of this new project will be to get amazing authors seen and get them followers allowing for all their posts to get seen and receive value.",

    "body": "<center>![nextgensocialf50d9.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/nextgensocialf50d9.jpg)</center>\n\n# For several years now I\u2019ve been wondering what will replace Facebook. \n\nI\u2019ve been looking for an alternative for a few years now and I\u2019m also quite used the idea that social networks change every so often, usually every 6-7 years. As far as social media goes, I\u2019ve tried and created content for just about everything including Blogger, HotOrNot, Tumblr, Periscope, Reddit, YouTube, Linkedin, Snapchat, Twitter, Medium, Findery, Pinterest, Instagram, about.me, Vine, Blab, Foursquare, Yelp, Quora, Etsy, Ebay, Teachable, well you get the idea. It\u2019s fairly obvious that I'm really passionate about online communication, content creation and sharing information.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll basically try anything new that comes along and I\u2019m always on the lookout for some new creative way to express myself, make a living and connect with others in a virtual manner. In 2002-3 I taught myself HTML and dabbled with creating websites. I built an experimental website called Wrongland that contained hidden treasures in it. It was designed to reward those who dug deep into the site, as only certain pages contained gifts. And every day, the location of the gifts changed. The gifts consisted mostly of plastic sandwiches that were sent via snail mail to the winners in a brown paper sack.\u00a0\n\nNot many people even found the gifts because not many people could find my website. But it was fun and I liked to see how something real could materialize from the virtual world. After building a few websites for myself and others, I noticed that I liked to learn how to build them, but I didn\u2019t enjoy building them to make money. I seemed to enjoy the creating aspect more than anything else. Building websites soon lost its shiny new feel and then I found the social network Friendster which I joined right away. Myspace came soon after that, and I quickly jumped onto that, abandoning Friendster. Due to social pressure, I joined Facebook in 2008, even though I remember liking Myspace more at the time. I\u2019ve been on Facebook ever since, but I began losing interest in it around 2013.\n\n## In 2013-2014 I noticed the thrill of sharing personal stuff with friends and family on Facebook was losing its luster. \n\nAnd added to that, something in me changed the day my father, who is 83 years old, came down the stairs and said,\n\n>\u201cI woke up and saw my Facebook memories and couldn\u2019t believe it. I wonder what my memories will be tomorrow?\u201d\n\nFrom that day on, my father continually refers to the algorithmically-induced Facebook memory retrieval system as \u201cMy Memories\u201d. I\u2019m not sure why this particular Facebook feature creeps me out so much, but I think it\u2019s truly disturbing how an algorithm can have such a powerful effect on our emotions and control how we feel about our past and life itself. This prompted me to think more critically about Facebook and its effect on human beings.\n\nI increasingly felt that something was missing from my Facebook experience and indeed, I was not alone. I am not saying that Facebook will suffer the same fate as Myspace but I think it could definitely lose its footing in the coming years. Why do I think this? If I have successfully gotten over my Facebook addiction, this means that others have too, or will do the same in the future.\n\nFacebook doesn\u2019t solve my problems anymore. For starters, it doesn\u2019t provide me with any income and as an independent creator/writer/artist, I generally find myself having to pay Facebook to promote my posts to my own followers. Facebook\u2019s algorithms changed in their favor, not mine. Also, I am more and more bothered by the fact that my artistic content is generating revenue for Facebook, not for me. At the core, I do not feel that I have control over my own social network and I also feel exploited to some degree.\n\n## Additionally, all my relatives are now on Facebook, and the whole experience feels stifling to my creativity. It feels too big, too impersonal and too big brother-ish. I\u2019m ready for new options.\u00a0\n\nLuckily, there are many new, disruptive and exciting social media platforms emerging. The energy that is brewing just under the surface of the old platforms is stirring up memories of the early days of the internet when Napster was alive, YouTube was just starting and Myspace was still a thing.\u00a0\n\u2028\n# So, what are these new social platforms and how are they different from Facebook?\n\u2028\nWhile the emerging social media platforms are all different from each other, they share some core similarities. These similarities are in the basic way they function as well as the new technology they use. All of these new platforms are based on decentralized power and most use blockchain technology.\u00a0\n\n# When you look at history, if many diverse groups of people are all working on the same kind of technology and systems separately, then you know that this technology/system will come to pass eventually. \n\nRight now there are approximately five major groups building out the next generation of social media. There may be more that I\u2019m unaware of.\u00a0\n\n## These five groups have largely abandoned the hierarchical system that defines most corporate structures. \n\nThe corporate structure is defined by the top dogs getting most of the spoils from the bottom-dwelling people. The corporate system is an extractive and exploitive one, with the CEO at the top of the food chain, and the workers having little to no intrinsic value besides what they can produce for the ones who manage them. Autonomy is not rewarded or considered a desirable trait and generally speaking, those who are autonomous or who do not go along with the established system of power are routinely fired. What\u2019s left in a corporation is a large group of sheep who have exchanged their free will and critical thinking abilities for a set amount of money each month.\u00a0\n\nThese new social media platforms reject this hierarchical system. Not all of these new platforms are perfect, though, and some retain remnants of centralized control. All of them have been inspired by the success of the digital currency, Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been successfully running without a CEO since its inception. Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the [Bitcoin white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), creating the concept initially, but then vanished into obscurity after it was implemented. His/her/their identity is still unknown. Gavin Andresen is currently the Chief Scientist for the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\n## Blockchain is Bitcoin's killer technology.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s killer technology is called [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)), and it\u2019s the central technological advancement that virtually all the new social media sites are developing. Blockchain technology is currently revolutionizing the worlds of finance, government, banking and now social media. The blockchain allows transactions to be processed in a tamper-proof, transparent manner and these transactions are carried out by computer miners who live all over the globe.\n\nSo, that should lay the foundation for what I am about to cover next: emerging next-gen social media sites. Some you can join today, others are on the verge of being released and still others will not be released until the end of this year or the beginning of 2017. I do not recommend that anyone invest any money into these platforms. I do recommend, however, investing time in these emerging networks. Turn your existing Facebook or Reddit addiction into a new social media adventure where you can get many more of your needs met while you\u2019re meeting brand-new people from all over the world. It\u2019s the Wild West of social media again! Let\u2019s go!\n\n\n![ahaska-letters-symbol_2x85107.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/ahaska-letters-symbol_2x85107.jpg)\n\n## Akasha http://akasha.world/\n\nAkasha stands for \u201cAdvanced Knowledge Architecture for Social Human Advocacy.\" Akasha is a decentralized social media platform built on the Ethereum network and the Inter-Planetary File System. Akasha is a decentralized social media platform that rewards its content creators with Ethereum\u2019s native digital currency, ETH. If Ethereum is new to you, here\u2019s a definition:\n>\u201cEthereum is a public blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a cryptocurrency called ether.\u201d -wikipedia\n\nFrom the Akasha website:\n>\"You can publish, share and vote for entries, similar to Medium and other modern publishing platforms, with the difference that your content is actually published over a decentralized network rather than on our servers. Moreover, the votes are bundled with ETH micro transactions so if your content is good you\u2019ll make ETH from it \u2013 in a way, mining with your mind.\u201d\n\nAkasha is set to release its Beta version at the end of 2016. Akasha is led by Mihai Alisie, the co-founder of Ethereum.\n\n\u2028![drawing_thunderdc6ca.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/drawing_thunderdc6ca.jpg)\n\n## Diaspora https://diasporafoundation.org/\n\nDiaspora is a user-owned, nonprofit distributed social network that is kept free of corporate take-overs. It is different from the four other networks in that it doesn\u2019t have a monetary system baked in. Users retain rights to their own content and third parties are not allowed access to the content on Diaspora. The network is made up of nodes and makes use of Diaspora\u2019s software. Users can decide whether their content will be \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201climited.\u201d In this way, users have control over who sees different kinds of their content. Diaspora was founded in 2010 and as of March 2014, there are 1 million Diaspora accounts. Founders: Ilya Zhitomirskiy, Dan Grippi, Max Salzberg, and Raphael Sofaer.\u00a0\n\n![steemitlogof4b93.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/steemitlogof4b93.jpg)\n\n## Steemit https://steemit.com/\n\nSteemit is a disruptive blockchain-based social media site that focuses on blogging. This is a network you can join today. Steemit pays you in digital currency to create original content. It\u2019s still in Beta, but it\u2019s an amazing opportunity to learn about the blockchain. It has the feel of Medium mixed with Reddit and it values original, long-form content over short posts. Many of its core users are experts in the digital currency space. Digital currency is more commonly referred to as cryptocurrency. Steemit is not a get rich quick kind of place, but rather a place where people are working towards building and developing a functional new system. Steemit has a built-in reputation system and a weighted voting system that is based on a user\u2019s Steem Power. Steemit is a website application that is built upon a transparent, decentralized blockchain. Steemit.com contains both centralized and decentralized power structures. Steem is the digital currency that fuels the ecosystem, and Steemit.com can be thought of as one branch of a big tree known as Steem. The digital currency that fuels Steemit has three kinds in it: Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollars. Steem and Steem Dollars can be publicly traded on cryptocurrency marketplaces like Bittrex and Poloniex. The founders are Daniel Larimer and Ned Scott.\n\n![Synereo-Logo-Bitcoinist.net_a68cd.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/Synereo-Logo-Bitcoinist.net_a68cd.jpg)\n\u2028\n## Synereo https://www.synereo.com/\n\nA blockchain-based social media site that will release its alpha version soon and has been in development for two years. Synereo is purely decentralized in that its social network is peer-to-peer with no central authority acting as a liason. Synereo also uses invitation protocol to keep your personal network under your control. Synereo has its own digital currency called AMPs which can be traded on digital currency marketplaces. Synereo has been built using the attention economy model and also makes use of a reputation system. When content creators publish something on Synereo, they can add AMPs to make it travel and reach people outside their network. Also, people who engage with content that is \u2018AMPed\u2019 can gain a portion of those AMPs.\n\nThe Synereo team has been developing the technology behind its network for over five years. It has really big goals for the future that go well beyond social media. It is developing technology for smart contracts and also distributed storage. It has been dubbed the \u201cFacebook killer\u201d. The founders are Dor Konforty and Greg Meredith.\n\n![apple-touch-icon43924.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/apple-touch-icon43924.jpg)\n\n## Yours https://www.yours.network/\n\nThe Yours network is building a social media site using the existing Bitcoin blockchain. Content creators of all kinds will be able to receive Bitcoin micropayments from the people who feel passionate about their work. Yours appears to have a reputation system and also a way for people to earn Bitcoin from curating content. It\u2019s still in development and its strongest aspect is that it can build upon an established community of Bitcoin users.\u00a0\n\n>\u201cAlongside payments, user identities will also be decentralized. \u201cWe plan to utilize a form of decentralized ID like BlockStack,\u201d McKie said, although they haven\u2019t settled on which framework they\u2019ll be using yet. The developer was adamant, however, about users being in full control over their own data. \u201cYours accounts will only have as much information as you give,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou have full control of your private keys in your Yours wallet.\u201d-http://bravenewcoin.com/news/bitcoin-based-content-platform-yours-attracts-overwhelming-interest-from-investors/\n\nThe founder is Ryan X Charles who was previously employed as the Cryptocurrency Engineer at Reddit.\n\u2028\n# As more decentralized social media sites emerge, the competition between them will of course become fierce. However, I believe there is room for all of them. \n\nI also believe that they can all learn from each other to become more efficient. If one technology outperforms the rest, it should be adopted by the others. Similarly, if one kind of structure turns out to be more appealing to social media users, that structure should be adopted. There is no need to hang onto bad designs. The only reason egos exist is so they may be destroyed.\n\nMy outlook may be optimistic, but I am a firm believer in creating bridges between factions so that optimal positive changes occur during the emerging transition to decentralized systems. It\u2019s crucial that existing Facebook addicts find and join new decentralized social networks that meet their needs instead of exploit them. The future looks bright and it looks increasingly decentralized. \n\n# Let\u2019s do this.\n\nphotocollage made by me using an image from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)",

It's really easy and automated once you get started. \n\nThe cards work worldwide and is perfect for authors who live off of STEEM and constantly on the road. \n\nOthers cards are usually only for US citizens where E-Coin only has a small number of counties they do not support. \n\nI personally have been using this card, especially with Uber. I've had a problem with my BitPay and other cards with Uber but this card works wonders. \n\n**Step 1**\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-09-10 at 10.53.14 AM.png](https://s21.postimg.org/bey9az56v/Screen_Shot_2016_09_10_at_10_53_14_AM.png)](https://www.e-coin.io/?ref=d3a93795513249a896e4efa6f1d4e604/)\n[![Screen Shot 2016-09-10 at 10.49.49 AM.png](https://s21.postimg.org/q1z7sn3t3/Screen_Shot_2016_09_10_at_10_49_49_AM.png)](https://www.e-coin.io/?ref=d3a93795513249a896e4efa6f1d4e604)\n\n[Sign up for an account at E-Coin](https://www.e-coin.io/?ref=d3a93795513249a896e4efa6f1d4e604)\n\n (Note: This is my referral link, you will get a 25% discount on ALL available cards (USD/EUR/GBP))\n\n**Step 2**\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-09-10 at 10.52.05 AM.png](https://s21.postimg.org/af7yf9q13/Screen_Shot_2016_09_10_at_10_52_05_AM.png)](https://www.e-coin.io/?ref=d3a93795513249a896e4efa6f1d4e604)\n\nThe quickest and easiest method is to get a Virtual Card. It costs $3.00 and gets delivered to your email instantly. You will get the Card Number, CVV, and you set your Billing Address and PIN. It can be denominated in USD, EUR, or GBP\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-09-10 at 10.52.17 AM.png](https://s21.postimg.org/r1piociyv/Screen_Shot_2016_09_10_at_10_52_17_AM.png)](https://www.e-coin.io/?ref=d3a93795513249a896e4efa6f1d4e604)\n\nThe second option is ordering a physical card which costs $12.75 (Minus 25% for using my link above))\n\nThe fees and limits for using the card are really low: https://www.e-coin.io/bitcoin-debit-card-fees-and-limits \n\n**Step 3**\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-09-10 at 10.53.56 AM.png](https://s21.postimg.org/3kxnpkxdz/Screen_Shot_2016_09_10_at_10_53_56_AM.png)](https://www.e-coin.io/?ref=d3a93795513249a896e4efa6f1d4e604)\n\nOnce you have your virtual card, login into the E-Coin account page. I recommend setting up 2 factor authentication. Download the app for iPhone or Android. \n\n**Step 4**\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-09-10 at 10.56.06 AM.png](https://s21.postimg.org/4ypakvwnb/Screen_Shot_2016_09_10_at_10_56_06_AM.png)](https://www.e-coin.io/?ref=d3a93795513249a896e4efa6f1d4e604)\n\nClick Top Up With Shapeshift and complete a deposit!\n\nYou can also deposit Bitcoin or any of the dozens of digital currencies. \n\n**Step 5**\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-09-10 at 10.57.24 AM.png](https://s21.postimg.org/wyoc81ts7/Screen_Shot_2016_09_10_at_10_57_24_AM.png)](https://www.e-coin.io/?ref=d3a93795513249a896e4efa6f1d4e604)\n\nOnce you have deposited STEEM, click Load Card to convert the funds to fiat and start spending! \n\nThe whole process can take 10 minutes and topping up only takes confirmation. I do everything from my mobile. \n\nWhat is your method of spending STEEM? Do you have any questions? \n\n-Charlie",

    "body": "<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\nhttp://www.thedigeratilife.com/images/market-emotions-2.jpg\n</div>\nSome people have suggested that we reduce the power down period to improve market liquidity.  I have been thinking about the economics of this and wanted to share my thoughts.  \n\n## Power Down Delay Slows Price Discovery \n\nPrice is the balance point between supply and demand at any given point in time.  The Power Down restrictions have the impact of holding *Supply* off the market.  Much of this *supply* wants to sell at today's price, but cannot.  The reason it *wants to sell* is because those doing the selling have earned a *massive* profit in a short period of time.  Their costs are next to nothing.  They will continue to sell until the price falls low enough that it isn't worth selling.  \n\nIf Steem Power were liquid, then the price would fall toward this equilibrium faster in a *race to the exits*.   The people that dump first win (in the short term) and the rest lose (in the short term).   There will always be a market value and the price will never go to 0 so long as there is at least one person who believes in the *potential value* of the platform.  My experience with BitShares and dozens of other cryptocurrency projects is that nothing with any community behind it will fall to 0.   Even simple Bitcoin clones that have been around for years and offer relatively little innovation with non-existent development teams (Doge, Peercoin, Namecoin) continue to be traded with $100K+ in daily volume with marketcap in the millions.     \n\n## Power Down makes Cashout more Fair \n\nWith a power down system, everyone is forced to \"dollar-cost-average\" their selling over 2 years.  This means that whales that might have cashed out $1M dollars at the height of the bubble were only able to cash out $50,000 at the high prices while they have watched their remaining Steem Power fall in value to $200,000.  Their average \"cashout\" price will not be the height of the market, but the market average over 2 years.  \n\nThis has pros and cons.  In some sense it limits the ability of speculators to buy and sell over periods of a couple of months.  Anyone speculating over more than a couple of days is paying a very large inflation tax.  The loss of this speculative capital impacts the liquidity and potentially the price.  We live in a world where traders want the ability to move to the next big thing and having capital tied up in the *last big thing* is a much riskier proposition. \n\n## Author Rewards\n\nAuthor Rewards are also designed to delay cashout by paying in Steem Dollars.  You could sell immediately at a loss, or you could \"trust and wait\" and make more.   As the price falls, the market value of the immediate author rewards also falls, but this is *OK*.   Authors looking for a quick buck need to go elsewhere.  Meanwhile, those who stay and work to grow the long-term value of the platform will gain in Steem Power.  When the value of the platform finally grows as a result of years of effort they will be the new whales.  \n\nYou may only get $10 worth of Steem Power for a post today.  It might not even seem to be worth your time, but if you and others stick around and grow the value of the platform then one day your $10 will be worth $400 if we grow the platform to Bitcoin scale.  If we grow to Facebook scale it will be worth $4000.   \n\n## Starting a Company\nThose who start a company are paid in shares that are worthless.  They cannot be sold on the market until one day in the distant future the company is successful and has an IPO.  The present value of the shares isn't what the entrepreneurial employees care about, it is the future value.  \n\nLikewise, a farmer who spends millions of dollars on land, equipment, and seeds works day in and day out in the hope that his farm will eventually produce a crop worth enough to justify his time and effort.  The farmer is in the red clear up until the day he brings his harvest to market.   \n\nDon't join Steemit for the quick buck.  Be glad there is someone willing to pay such high prices for a stake in Steem today.  Don't fear the fall in market value, look at the incredible amounts people are still earning.  Don't look at what you have today, look at what you could have in the future.  \n\nSteem is in the early adopter phase, those who work hard and help pull this platform forward will reap what they sow.  \n\n\n## Changing the Power Down Period\n\nIf we were to reduce the Power Down period from 2 years to 1 year or even 6 months, this would dramatically increase the net present value of Steem Power while simultaneously increase the amount of liquid Steem on the market in the short term.   The end result would be faster price discovery, but no one can say whether the new price will be higher or lower than the old price.  \n\nSome people speculate that value that is 2+ years in the future is discounted to near 0 value today (especially in the world of cryptocurrency).   This means that longer time horizons have diminishing marginal utility when it comes to encouraging voters to behave in the long-term best interest of the platform.\n\n## Emotional Response \n\nDespite all the logic in the world, humans have irrational feelings with respect to profit and loss.  Slow steady growth *feels* much better than *rapid rise* followed by *slow steady decline* even if both curves end up at the same final value (long term growth).  I for one prefer a slow steady rise, but that isn't possible until after the *rapid rise* has fully corrected and realigned.  This will take time and won't happen until after fear, desperation, panic, and despondency set in.\n\nThose who know about this emotional roller coaster can ride the waves and maximize their profit, but most people give in to their irrational emotional side and buy high and sell low.  My preference is to sell high and buy low.    \n\nDon't let the market price set your opinion on the value of a platform, instead make rational buy / sell decisions that factor in both short-term trends and long-term value.  This applies to any investment you might consider.",

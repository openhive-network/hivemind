    "body": "http://media1.santabanta.com/full1/Animals/Rabbits/rabbits-0a.jpg\n\n\nI have been working on this hypothesis for a while now. I call it the 1 out of 10. \nIt is stated as follows:\nIn the population, about 9 out of 10 people are worthless idiots. \n\nThis is not immutable. It is a general working idea. \nDepending on the group, there will be sometimes less and sometimes more. \nGeorge Carlin said, \u201cthink of how dumb the average person is. \nWell half of them are dumber than that.\u201d \nWith the 1 out of 10 hypothesis, I'm taking it farther than that. \n\nThere are some interesting aspects that arise as a result of applying this idea. \n\n   First, I find, that in applying it to the self, I cannot be certain to which group I belong. \nI know to which group I wish to belong but let's not make any assumptions. \nI know where that leads. \nThere are tests I can take, which will narrow it down. \nIn the end I've found no way to be sure. \nThe only statement I can make is that I would like to belong to the 1 out of 10. \nSo, already, I have provided myself with the inspiration to strive to be something \nother than a worthless idiot. This, in my opinion, is progress. \nIsn't that what most of us want? I don't know, I'm only me. \n\n   Second, this removes the need for inferiority complexes.\nInstead of comparing myself to others, it becomes more useful to compare others to me.\nIf I am not going to find value in 9 out of 10, the methods of search must change.\nGetting lost in the weeds is not entertainment.\n\n   Third, I find that it gets to the heart of the \u201cisms\u201d. \nRacism, sexism et cetera are wiped away the instant I apply the 1 out of 10 hypothesis. \nThe hypothesis tells us that it is not any group that are worthless or dangerous, \nbut, that about 90% of every group are worthless, if not dangerous.  \nAgain, this brings me to the same dilemma. How do I sort out which is which?\n\nThere are metaphors to be found in nature.\nRabbits, for example, most rabbits are what are called, food. \nMaybe 5 or 10 out of 100 are the wily ones, the ones that reproduce.\n\nI do hope this does not come across as overly harsh.\nThe 1 out of 10 that I find of value may bear no relation \nto those that you choose for yourself.\nI am not advocating getting rid of the 9 out of 10.\nThis is more of a match making for friends.\n\nI believe this tack is providing me with useful insights. \nThe more I apply it the more I learn.\nMeans and methods remain to be defined.\n\nIf anyone has any reasonable suggestions, leave a reply. Thank you for your attention.\n\n\n\nimage: media1.santabanta.com",

    "body": "@herpetologyguy\n\nOne of my many tasks as a zoo keeper is connecting people to animals. \n-\n<html>\n\n\n<p>The museum I work at is unique because we showcase animals that are native to Virginia -- meaning that these are animals people will find close to home, rather than across the ocean in some distant country. This makes my job more crucial in that I am responsible for educating people about the reptiles and amphibians that they will find in their own backyards. And obviously, there\u2019s one group of reptiles that gives people more pause than almost any other animal . . . .&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Snakes.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj   &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>I do public programs featuring snakes quite frequently. &nbsp;I believe people should know how to identify local venomous/non-venomous snakes, their role in the environment and how to deal with them when they are in close proximity to our homes. &nbsp;Usually, I get eager audiences asking great questions. &nbsp;But, every now and then, I get some idiot who tells me, \u201cI saw that same snake in my backyard! I chopped off its head with a shovel!\u201d</p>\n<p>Are they an idiot for killing the snake? &nbsp;Not necessarily . . . I don\u2019t know the situation behind the encounter. But, only an idiot would walk into a wildlife facility, approach a zoo keeper and proudly declare that they kill the very same animals that the keeper is charged with the care for. &nbsp;Would you walk into an animal shelter and tell someone working there that you enjoy stomping on puppies? &nbsp;To us, there\u2019s not much difference\u2026&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com\">Credit</a>\n</p>\n<p>The best we can do in these situations is to try to educate people. This can be difficult because so many people are set in their ways -- plus we have to combat an instinctive fear and prejudice against snakes. &nbsp;So, I\u2019m going to briefly lay it all out for you and tell you \"<em><strong>Why you shouldn\u2019t kill that snake in your yard.</strong></em>\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s ILLEGAL in most states to kill a wild snake, unless that snake presents an IMMEDIATE threat.</strong></em> &nbsp;And no, a snake crawling through your yard does not represent a good enough excuse to use force. &nbsp;We\u2019re talking about a situation where a venomous snake is about to strike and you have no escape route but to fight your way out. &nbsp;And guess what, that really doesn\u2019t ever happen (barring instances where someone purposefully provokes an animal). &nbsp;Wildlife and law enforcement agencies are cracking down on people killing snakes, so it\u2019s better to keep yourself out of trouble.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>2. &nbsp;<em><strong>You are putting yourself in harm\u2019s way. &nbsp;</strong></em>The vast majority of snake bites occur when people attempt to capture or kill snakes. &nbsp;If left alone, the snake CANNOT hurt you. &nbsp;Call wildlife services or trained professionals to remove the animal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>3. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s an incredibly beneficial animal, and you\u2019d be foolish to kill it.</strong></em> &nbsp;Small snakes eat a huge variety of pest insects that destroy gardens, while large snakes typically feed on rats and other rodents that infest our homes. &nbsp;If you see a large snake hanging around, you have a rodent problem; snakes will not hang around if there is no food source. &nbsp;To keep snakes from being attracted to your property, do your best to remove any shelter or food sources that would attract rodents. &nbsp;Some snakes even eat other snakes, and species like the harmless king snake will even feed on venomous species!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImOj1CKTBqE\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>4. &nbsp;<em><strong>Another snake might show up.</strong></em> &nbsp;Snakes will not typically inhabit the same area in order to avoid competition. &nbsp;If you kill that harmless rat snake, but you still have a food source nearby, another snake may move in to make use of that source. &nbsp;The new snake may be another harmless species or something a bit less desirable. &nbsp;So why not let that harmless snake take care of the infestation for you?</p>\n<p>http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>Having a snake around can be hugely beneficial to you. &nbsp;It is a free, environmentally-safe form of pest control. &nbsp;Snakes, including venomous species, are non-aggressive animals (unless you provoke them) that will actively do their best to AVOID people. &nbsp;A resident snake will often go unnoticed by homeowners, and most encounters are fleeting glimpses of the snake making a hasty escape. &nbsp;Remember that snakes have their own unique role in the environment, and regardless of our own fears and feelings towards them, they are a necessary part of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg &nbsp; <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org\">Credit</a></p>\n</html>\n\nif you liked this also please check out:\nhttps://steemit.com/science/@herpetologyguy/what-are-herptiles-indentifying-reptiles-vs-amphibians\n\n\n***don't forget to follow @herpetologyguy***",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><em><strong>Have you ever thought your family belongs in a soap opera? Probably! Me too! I unwittingly stumbled into my very own soap opera when I met my wonderful husband.</strong></em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>My husband Sergio and I were not introduced, we met randomly one day at our local swimming pool, 27 years later the rest is history, so they say. Our family backgrounds were completely different. My parents are South African, born and bred, I have a younger sister and brother and we had what I would consider a normal, pretty boring, truth be told, upbringing.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sergio's family immigrated to South Africa in 1970, when he was 4 years old, from Mauritius. And when I say family, I mean <em>a lot of family.</em> Sergio's family is French Mauritian, and speak Creole too. Although they had been in South Africa for a long time when I met my husband in 1989, my mom-in-law's accent was so thick I could barely understand her.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/sars9hbej/002.jpg\" width=\"887\" height=\"738\"/></p>\n<p><em>(my mom-in-law Jeanine, and my husband Sergio)</em></p>\n<p>My mom-in-law, Jeanine, fell pregnant with Sergio when she was just 16 years old. She had an affair with a wealthy local businessman, Henri, who was in his forties. Jeanine's mother, Sergio's grandmother, took over the majority of his care and she was a very stern woman. Jeanine had two sisters and three brothers. Her older sister Sylvie married a local gangster and had 3 children in 3 years, before she was 20 years old.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Young Jeanine soon met her husband, Jean, who was the youngest of 10 children. He had a good job and a condition of their marriage (made by the strict grandmother) was that he had to pay the costs of most of the family emigrating to South Africa. I don't think Jeanine ever loved Jean. Eventually the whole family ended up in South Africa, including Sylvie, who had to leave her 3 children with her gangster husband, and escape in the night. Henri, Sergio's biological father paid for the passage of at least one of the siblings, the youngest brother, Irwin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/lycmzn8cb/012.jpg\" width=\"581\" height=\"993\"/></p>\n<p><em>(Jeanine, Sergio, and her sister, Sylvie)</em></p>\n<p>Upon the family's arrival in SA, they had nothing and had to find a way to create a future for themselves. (Jeanine was a \"chauffeur to an Indian \"witchdoctor\" for a while). They were very poor and Sergio spent 2 years of his early childhood with 2 separate families who had fostered him for a year each. This is not ideal for a child, but I think it was a blessing in his case, as his family is pretty dysfunctional.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sergio's grandfather was an alcoholic, and he passed away shortly after the family's arrival in SA. Apparently he had ridden on the back of a bakkie (pick-up truck) for an entire 300km journey, after which he contracted pneumonia and died. His grandmother suffered from an unknown disease where she became progressively paralysed and died too. She had been a harridan, and after she passed the family let loose and had fun.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/3lgn2tn97/017.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"681\"/></p>\n<p><em>(Sergio's scary grandmother)</em></p>\n<p>Sergio fondly remembers the wild 1970's parties, movie nights and poker evenings held at his mom's house. The family stuck together, and would generally move where Jean was able to find work. The memories of drinking and fighting were not so positive. Jeanine's 2 sisters, Sylvie and Joyce soon married. Sylvie had another 3 children and became a dressmaker. Joyce married, had 2 boys, and then her husband ran away and became a tramp. There are still occasional sightings of him on the Durban beachfront. She then married the tramp's brother, had a daughter, then soon after her new husband died of a heart attack. We have been subjected to the \"I'm a widow\" woes for decades. She did disastrously remarry again, but that is a story for an<em>(</em>another time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/v7jeni6m3/015.jpg\" width=\"507\" height=\"525\"/></p>\n<p><em>(Sergio, Norman and Joyce)</em></p>\n<p>Jeanine's 3 brothers were hooligans, living it up, fighting (especially with the Afrikaans people) and drinking. One night, Harvey went to work at the local metal works, under the influence and fell to his death from a crane. This was not before he had 2 children with 2 separate girlfriends, and whose respective mothers cut off all contact with the family. Both children somehow found each other, and found their way back to their extended family when they became adults.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/r3ifv0anv/042.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"561\"/></p>\n<p><em>(Harvey and Sergio)</em></p>\n<p>Sergio was close to his uncle Norman, who had moved to Johannesburg, but who came \"home\" to party almost every weekend. Sergio used to stay with him and his wife Chrissy over school holidays, but was traumatised by his uncle's physical violence toward his wife when he had been drinking. The couple eventually divorced, and Norman stopped drinking. His wife Chrissy, entered a lesbian relationship, but remains close to the family until today.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/76cim1rsr/023.jpg\" width=\"954\" height=\"721\"/></p>\n<p><em>(Sergio, isn't he CUTE! and Chrissy)</em></p>\n<p>The youngest brother, Irwin, was a talented mechanic, but suffered from serious alcoholism. He married a divorced woman with children, and Sergio's family stayed with them for a while when times were tough. His relationship also ended in divorce, with no children of their own. As his alcoholism spiraled out of control, he met and lived with women who were as equally alcoholic as he was. A few years after I met Sergio, Irwin's girlfriend fell pregnant, but drank to a shocking degree during the pregnancy. She went into premature labour at 6 months and died during childbirth. The baby was adopted by a couple who later emigrated to Australia. They once sent a photo to Irwin of the little girl, and I could clearly see she suffered from foetal alcohol syndrome. For many years Irwin would \"loan\" money from Sergio, always reminding him of how he had looked after his family for a little while.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Jeanine had another child, Ricardo, when Sergio was 5 years old. Sergio's half brother, Ricardo, is the source of the family's more dramatic incidents. I can say with full confidence that I am grateful no other children were born into the family. Jeanine told me that she had suffered a late stage miscarriage/stillbirth, but she had never told my husband. I told him. Sergio has 4 older half brothers and sisters, his biological father's other children, but although they know about his existence, they refuse to acknowledge him.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Only 2 siblings remain of the original family, Sylvie and Joyce. All the rest have passed on, including my father-in-law Jean. (Many of his 10 brothers and sisters also relocated to SA, but concentrating on my husband's family is more than enough for me.) This piece is intended as an introduction to some of the more dramatic stories I have been privy to and intend to share!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Thank you for reading!

We cannot keep fixating on the darkness, we will go deep enough that we are in the palms of their hands. Entertain it, and become it!**\n\nI have heard a lot of videos, channellings and higher mind wisdom about ball of the good that is going on around the world, but I also think we should be aware of both. If you are only focusing and feeding your information hungry soul with negative possible realities and futures, I urge you to focus on some of the more pleasant Ideas and possibilities, because I used to only focus on the bad. I one day say and felt the love in the universe, and have been on a binge of light ever since. There are links below if you want to learn alternate views. The information below speaks for itself. Please give it a bit of your time to see if it is for you, there are many different personalities and ways of learning below, and at least one should have lots to offer you and the wisdom is priceless. Our new currency will be attention, we will need to learn to give our attention to beneficial outlets. This information overload age needs our conscious choice so we do not let our attention fall into the wrong hands. \n Namaste.\n\n(HigherSelf \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37eaIEspApQ\n\n'Teachers of Light!'......\nBashar (Youtube Channel)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/BasharCommunications\nHigherSelf \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBz4vE0S8E1Osn_GiE2QGGQ\nAwakeningOurTruth (Youtube Channel)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/AwakeningOurTruth\nKRYON (Website)\nhttp://www.kryon.com/altindex_menu/Channellings.html\nKRYON (Youtube Channel)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbzZmC-cvS57cWbeBe7XPoA",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>http://i65.tinypic.com/25g9u03.jpg</p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to get rid of the nasty smelly smoking habit. I have decided that I\u2019m quitting cigarettes after smoking for 15years.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>It has to happen</h2>\n<p>Over this long period of time I have never tried to quit. Never once did I try the patch, or the gum, or the pills. I never wanted to give it up or had the urge to until lately.</p>\n<p>I can tell my lungs and throat are getting damaged from long term smoking, and my breathing ability is poor. I\u2019m in decent shape, but I can\u2019t run any sort of distance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My gums have been receding because of smoking, and the dentist has told me if I don\u2019t stop I will most likely lose my teeth in the future.</p>\n<p>Not only do I notice the increasing medical concerns, but I\u2019m also tired of the smell. I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s embarrassing to always smell like thick stale smoke.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The biggest problem I have with smoking though is the COST!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In my State, my brand of cigarettes are $7.50 a pack in which I will typically smoke a pack a day. That comes to over $200 a month, and nearly $2,500 a year to pollute my body.</p>\n<p>Now that I\u2019m older and realize the implications of smoking</p>\n<h2>I want out!</h2>\n<p>http://i65.tinypic.com/23kymtj.jpg</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always planned on quitting when I was \u201colder\u201d So before I actually get that \u201colder\u201d age and have cancers,&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>I have decided I\u2019m done.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Statistics show it will take the average smoker 4+ attempts to actually kick the habit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I\u2019m going for 1 round.</p>\n<p>http://i64.tinypic.com/34zblaw.jpg</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I would enjoy it if other Steemit users would join in on this challenge, and we can work at quitting together. Provide support and encouragement during the struggles.</p>\n<p>I believe that the hardest point will be the 1st week, with day1 being the most difficult day to overcome.</p>\n<h3>LET\u2019S GET TO IT!</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>After reading up on successful stories of quitting smoking, I found that many users recommend a plan of attack.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Pick a day within the week, and stick to that day.</li>\n  <li>Have a nicotine replacement.</li>\n  <li>Learn stress relief techniques</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>SO, I\u2019ve planned this out as <strong>Sunday Sept. 18th</strong> as my First Day. That gives me a solid 3days to prepare.</p>\n<p>I have purchased the Blu E-Cig. I have read many success stories of people switching over from traditional cigarettes to E-cigs, and then slowly stopped e-cigs. I have decided Cold Turkey probably won\u2019t work for me, so this is the route I plan to take.</p>\n<p>http://i68.tinypic.com/scuhpy.png</p>\n<p>My stress relief techniques are to work out each day. I have been slowly increasing my workout routine now that I have been going back to college. I can use there amazing complex, so I\u2019ve been making it to the gym more frequently. &nbsp;I read that exercise is a great way to feel better about quitting as you begin to notice your lung capacity recovering.</p>\n<p>I Hope the Steemit Community joins in, and others participate. It would be amazing to have multiple members within the community working on <strong>Kicking the Habit</strong>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and up voting.

If I used Poloniex or Bitfinex I would have done the same. Maybe I have some serious trust issues but I sense the winds of change are in the air.\n\n## These Centralized Crypto Trading Platforms are Just Too Dangerous for My Peace of Mind. ##\n\n<center>https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ozrRNp2cvPjl8B2/giphy.gif</center>\n\nA short while ago many of you were robbed on Bitfinex. This gave me a serious feeling of uneasiness. This also prompted a few geniuses in the Crypto world to move along decentralized trading platforms. \n\n## The Ah Ha Moment with a Crypto Genius. ##\n\nLast Sunday I had a working meeting with Ira Miller, the Ambassador of [Git Guild](http://gitguild.com). I shared with him my concerns and he promptly told me I was right to be concerned and that I should immediately take my BTC off of Bittrex. Now that was a problem because I essentially had zero BTC. I have 100% invested in Altcoins which means it takes time to unwind. I am one of those people who kept my coins on the exchange because I like the ease of access but I know this is not wise.\n\n## What Does Ira Miller of Git Guild Recommend? ##\n\nHe told me to start using [Bitsquare](https://bitsquare.io/) in the interim. He then told me his team is working on a decentralized trading platform. Of course my interest peaked but he could not give me anymore information than that. All I know is that I am thrilled to be working so closely with a visionary of the Crypto community!\n\nSo without hesitation I recommend you begin unwinding your positions across the centralized exchanges in anticipation of the decentralized trading platform tsunami coming our way. I am going to set up my Bitsquare trading account and give it a test drive. Stay tuned for a Bitsquare review!\n\n## Me Trying to Escape with My Bitcoin from the Centralized Crypto Trading Platforms. ##\n\n<center>https://media.giphy.com/media/l3vRkFsytsLileINi/giphy.gif</center>",

    "body": "<center>![robotee8b7.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/robotee8b7.jpg)</center>\nImage Source: pixabay\n\n# The robot vs. human wars have begun and it's being hashed out on Steemit:\n\nThese comments surfaced in response to posts by the AI @msgivings account:\n\n>\"I can't believe that this fucking bot got me in an argument with my girlfriend over my comment and it's not even human, fuck me.\"\n\n>\"She doesn't respond because this account is not legit. Shame on every one of the whales that upvoted it and all of the previous posts. Thousands of SBD have been thrown away on this and other fake accounts. The question is - do these whales know it? Are they actively scamming the platform themselves?\"\n\nBy this point, I suppose many of you realize that the account of @msgivings was not run by a human, but rather by artificial intelligence. If you take the time to actually read all the posts that @msgivings wrote, you'll notice some really odd cognitive dissonance. I could tell when I read just one of those posts that a real woman was not writing it. But I too, didn't really look into this account until fairly recently, because I was turned off by the clickbait nature of the titles. I ignored reading them until @yogi.artist pointed out that it's AI. \n\nThe Msgivings Robot has so far banked around $16,000 in blogging rewards from Steemit, and no one realized it until fairly recently. I think @bacchist and @reneenouveau may have been the first ones to reveal this AI hidden identity, but it was [@yogi.artist's post](https://steemit.com/steem/@yogi.artist/the-importance-of-physical-appearance-in-society-featuring-new-ai-author-mstakings) that truly opened my eyes to the high level that AI writing software programs have recently reached. He affectionately refers to Msgivings as \"Mstakings\". Another user has claimed that more than 1% of the high-paying trending articles are being written by AI, not real humans.\n\nWhat seals the deal for me personally, in verifying that the @msgivings account was AI is the fact that the account owner has vaporized. A real human would of course defend themselves and fight for their reputation, account and future in Steemit. Owners of AI scam accounts pack up and leave, respin their identity, respin their articles and try again, knowing that most of the whales don't really scrutinize the articles to any meaningful degree.\n\nI was examining the @msgivings account very thoroughly today and noticed that @msgivings had voted for @mibenkito and followed this account a few weeks ago. I then began reading that blog and noticed that @mibenkito had never bothered to write an \"Introduce Yourself\" post. I read every single one of the posts, and not one contained a photo with the standard holding of a \"Steemit\" sign. Odd, for sure. But the oddest thing to me was that in the introduction post, the very first line starts out like this:\n\n>\"I\u2019m an Asian and I live to eat.\"\n\nI lived in Asia and have a degree in Japanese. One of the things I immediately noticed when I lived in Japan is that Asian people rarely describe themselves as \"Asian\". In fact, in all my time spent living in Asia, I never heard one Asian refer to themselves as \"Asian.\" Koreans call themselves Koreans, Japanese call themselves Japanese, etc. Only people who are non-Asian refer to them as Asians. At least that has been my experience so far in life. There may be Asians who call themselves Asian, but I've never met them. \n\nSo, this first sentence feels really awkward and unusual for the reasons I listed above. The English contained in these posts is very strange, but not in a way that suggests it's written by a non-native English speaker. I was an English teacher in Japan and so I'm very familiar with how Japanese people write English. The English that was written in @mibenkito ranges from advanced English skills, with proper usage of commas, to low English usage. It's a strange and odd mix of levels. The first post is truly odd. I have been exposed to a lot of different English styles that were written by non-native English speakers and I've never come across such an odd and patchy style of writing. \n\n<center>![robot-707219_128024562.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/robot-707219_128024562.jpg)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay\n\nI am not saying that this account is AI, but it does contain rather inconsistent aspects, namely, that we do not know who @mibenkito is. Usually, on Steemit, people want to share their unique perspective, and they usually tell us where they are from originally, instead of just saying, \"I'm Asian.\" That's like me saying, \"I'm North American.\" Let's face it, no one says it. This all could be cleared up quite fast with a video or a standard introduce yourself post, complete with a Steemit sign.\n\nThis is not meant to be some kind of inquisition, but seeing as how the Steemit community paid out $16,000 to a robot whose owner has abandoned the platform, it's in our best interest to question the identity of posters, especially ones which are receiving massive payouts.\n\nThe word on the street from professional writers is that Steemit is attracting greedy scammers. And unfortunately, the quality is just not up to par yet with Medium. When whale voters, and the curation projects that dole out their funds don't take a close look at what they're voting on, we arrive in the situation of a robot making over $16,000. And now that robot is no where to be seen. The owner of @msgivings has abandoned his/her account. \n\n# The owner that created @msgivings could easily be making new accounts to fool gullible humans. \n\nThe thought process is going probably something like this: \"Well, I've exhausted that msgivings persona, so now I  can create a different persona, with different hobbies and interests, and as long as I fool the whale curation bots for a while, I'm good. I'll just take out the funds anyway.\"\n\n# I think we all deserve to know who was behind the @msgivings account. \n\n<center>![pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg)</center>\n\nThe proper thing to do would be to just come forward and tell the truth. **Describe the entire process, in all its gritty details.** Describe your elation when you discovered that an AI writing program could make you thousands of dollars. Explain what program you used, how you got it, and what other platforms you're currently using it on. Is this a freelance operation, and Steemit was just your highest paid client? What is the story behind this deception? \n\n# If you were really clever, you could write a book about this, throw it up on Amazon, and see more profits roll in. But you'd have to tell the truth first here on Steemit. \n\nCould you tell the truth? Is that even in your wheelhouse? What kind of human are you anyway? I think the people who you've incited, people who engaged with you for weeks, wrote lengthy comments, deserve to know the truth. Are you capable of telling the truth? Or do you operate on some other plane of deceptive existence? This is all really interesting and would make a fantastic book. Maybe I'll be the one to write the book and interview you anonymously at some point in the future. Would you do that? Would you offer up your true story anonymously? The questions keep coming, _WHO ARE YOU MSGIVINGS_?\n\n<center>![head-663997_128076d7e.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/head-663997_128076d7e.jpg)</center>\nImage Source: pixabay\n\n# Moving forward. \n\nWhat if all of us mere mortals adapted to this new AI technology, like most of us will be doing soon enough, and began using our own AI programs to generate content? What exactly would be the point of Steemit? Would the robot wars really move into high gear then? Would the advanced AI writing programs be winner take all? The only real interaction would be found in the comments, but an AI could be trained in that capacity, too.\n\nWhat is Steemit's official stance on AI-created content moving forward? How about, as long as it's clearly indicated that the content was created by artificial intelligence? But you and I know this is a silly utopian fantasy. Big profits won't come to those who transparently reveal that they are using AI to generate articles.\n\nAn what would be the point of humans upvoting a software writing program? Is a program more valuable than a human? Should we all become robot shepherds and get our own AI writing programs? What is the point of any of this? If AI takes over the trending pages, then what role will humans have here in Steemit? Will we become expert commenters and video creators, letting AI programs do the bulk of the arduous writing?\n\nI am not against AI and even I considered making an AI account that would be a robot twin of my writing. But I would properly identify it as AI using the sticker that @reneenouveau created, so that deception would not be a part of my deal. \n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/100bot.gif\n\nYou see, when you deceive others, you finally are forced to abandon your account. Why not create an AI account and do it transparently, with the entire community aware that it was created using AI? I have loads of questions about these AI programs, and I'm also looking to get my own soon. Or would that finally open the pandora's box that's waiting to happen? \n\n# Is that the singularity that everyone is talking about? Or has it already arrived?\n\n# The real problem doesn't lie within AI. The real problem lies within the deceptive human mind who is controlling AI.\n\n<center>![cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay",

    "body": "<strong> Hi Steemit-Community, in this article I want to show you some great photos and close up views of a curious bat fish, which I've seen while a dive in Egypt. </strong> You can find the details of the dive in my last \"Diving Impressions Update\". Batfishes (Platax) have a very flat body, small scales and a small mouth with small teeth. They can be identified on the dark-colored vertical lines over the eyes and the vertical stabiliser easily. The younger animals differ from the older fish by their extended abdomen, back, and tail fins. Batfish are very curious and they often swim to divers and nibble on their equipment or the fingers. They also try to catch the rising air bubbles from divers sometimes. <strong> A really funny fish! :) </strong>\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong> [German] Hallo Steemit-Community, in diesem Artikel m\u00f6chte ich euch einige tolle Fotos und Nahaufnahmen von einem neugierigen Fledermausfisch zeigen, den ich bei einem Tauchgang in \u00c4gypten gesehen habe. </strong> Die Details zu dem Tauchgang findet ihr in dem letzten \"Diving Impressions Update\" von mir. Fledermausfische (Platax) haben einen sehr flachen K\u00f6rper, kleine Schuppen und ein kleines Maul mit kleinen Z\u00e4hnen. Man erkennt sie leicht an den dunkel gef\u00e4rbten senkrechten B\u00e4ndern \u00fcber den Augen und den Seitenflossen. Die j\u00fcngeren Tiere unterscheiden sich von den \u00e4lteren Fischen durch ihre ausgezogenen Bauch-, R\u00fccken- und Schwanzflossen. Fledermausfische sind sehr neugierig und es wird oft beobachtet, dass sie Tauchern nachschwimmen und an deren Ausr\u00fcstung oder den Fingern knabbern. Sie probieren auch gerne mal nach den aufsteigenden Luftblasen von Tauchern zu schnappen. <strong> Ein sehr lustiger Fisch! :) </strong>\n\n<hr>\nClose-Up Views: <br>\n[German] Nahmaufnahmen:\n\n<a

He also gains the ability to tame the predators of Oros. There are two tribes that threaten the Winja's existence which are; the Udam tribe who are cannibals and prey on the Wenja, then there is the izila tribe who like to sacrifice the Winja using fire. Your goal is to grow your tribe, and wipe out the rival tribes so that yours can survive.\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=s3ke52\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/s3ke52.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the map of Oros </center>\n<br/>\n## Gameplay\n___\nWhen you start the game you start with nothing. So you have to craft your own weapons/tools in order to defend yourself, either from predatory animals or rival tribesmen and tribeswomen. Once you have crafted the bare essentials you then have to start taking territory for the wenja. You do this by clearing out camps, and bonfires.\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=rhlw86\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/rhlw86.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the crafting Menu, here is where you craft items </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=w7e6ps\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/w7e6ps.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the Skills Menu, this is where you can level up Takkar. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2hx3g21\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/2hx3g21.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is where you can upgrade your village to get even more added benefits </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=1534mkh\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/1534mkh.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This where you can look at the resources that you have on hand. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2hgfg2x\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/2hgfg2x.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> You can use an owl to scout an enemy encampment, and tag enemy positions. So that you can get them drop on them. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=353cavc\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/353cavc.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the Beast Selection Menu, here you can select between beasts that you have tamed. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2e3o750\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/2e3o750.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is my preferred beast, it is a Bloodfanged Sabortooth cat. Isn't he/she (I do not no its gender because you can not check) cute? </center>\n<br/>\n## Presentation\n___\nI like how the game looks, and how it behaves. For example when you are hunting animals, and hit one with a arrow usually in other games the animal tries and runs away, but in this game you can hit it with one arrow but does kill it right away you can fallow its blood trail until it drops dead. Not many games do that.\n## Final Thoughts\n___\nThere isn't many games that use a prehistoric setting like this, and for that I love it for that reason alone. If you want to give this game a try you can get it for PS4; XBOX ONE, an PC for around $60.\nSide Notes\n___\nThe Steem that I receive from these posts allows me to purchase new games, and this helps keep my posts consistent. Also if you want to talk about games in general my information is below, and if anyone is curious I take my own screenshots.\n# @tygergamer\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GWcS5Dm.jpg\n[tygergamer on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ty.miller.3720190)\n[Join Our Steemit Gaming Channel](https://steemit.chat/channel/gaming)\nIf you have PSN my username is tyger1313\n# Thank you to everyone for your continuing  support.",

Yet, sometimes, perceived injustice may lead in the right direction.\n\n![paper](https://source.unsplash.com/4fwRyKISwfk)\n<H4>Behold, the Agora! Voluntary, Free Exchange...</H4>\n<H5>Photo courtesy of [Juan ignacio Tapia](https://unsplash.com/@juanitapia) and [http://unsplash.com](http://unsplash.com)</H5>\n\n<H3>When I first began to create things of value, I wondered how to avoid the omnipresence of taxation.</H3>\n\nI had grown up in America in the 1950's, living my early years in a [pre-sales tax New York State](http://cber.bus.utk.edu/staff/mnmecon338/foxipt.pdf). That price tag you saw? It was *exactly* the amount you paid, imagine that!\n\nLike a frog in a warming pot, I was insensitive to the oppressive encroachment of taxes and regulations. For the typical young family, the federal tax system seemed to be a positive thing. Fill out your tax form and discover you have an [\"earned income credit.\"](https://www.taxact.com/tax-information/about-your-taxes/earned-income-credit.asp) You actually end up getting more money back than you put in!\n\n<H3>But try creating something new and valuable, and you'll soon find that the tax man is out to get you.</H3>\n\nIt was the mid 1970s, the outset of the computer revolution. I wrote and began selling several computer software titles by mail order. It soon became clear; this would be a losing proposition if the government got all they wanted. I began itemizing and digging for every deduction possible.\n\nTo my frustration, the software biz never quite \"took off\" for me, and I found myself back in the workforce. My employers somehow [seemed to believe it was OK to withhold part of my wage](https://steemit.com/taxes/@creatr/revolutionary-perspective-on-tax-withholding) and hand it over to the government. \"Oh, you want his money? Here you go!\"\n\n<H3>Decades of suffering ensued.</H3>\n\nI groaned under the tax burden, but found little or no sympathy or remedy. It seemed *so* unjust, but I kept on hearing [(even from the pulpit)](https://steemit.com/taxes/@creatr/revolutionary-perspective-on-tax-withholding) that this was \"the price of civilization.\" They said I \"owed\" taxes as a debt to the government.\n\nNot much changed until one day I began to get wind of the truth. I stumbled across the \"patriot movement,\" which led me to some of the pioneers of \"Tax Honesty.\"\n\nAttending a meeting conducted by [The Free Enterprise Society](http://freeenterprisesociety.com), I learned that (despite the maze of complex and confusing laws)\n<H3> I didn't *owe* the government *anything*.</H3>\n\nBut, knowing something to be true, and acting on that knowledge, turned out to be very different things.\n\n<H3>*Next Time* - Part 2: Tax Honesty</H3>\n---\n<H4>About This Series</H4>\nI'll be telling more of the story of my journey to voluntaryism than I've told anywhere before. I intend to include some strategies and examples, and hope to inspire you to action.\n\n[**Follow creatr? Click Here.**](https://steemit.com/@creatr)\n\nComments, questions?

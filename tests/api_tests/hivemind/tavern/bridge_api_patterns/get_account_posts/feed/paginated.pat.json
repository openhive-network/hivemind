    "body": "http://media1.santabanta.com/full1/Animals/Rabbits/rabbits-0a.jpg\n\n\nI have been working on this hypothesis for a while now. I call it the 1 out of 10. \nIt is stated as follows:\nIn the population, about 9 out of 10 people are worthless idiots. \n\nThis is not immutable. It is a general working idea. \nDepending on the group, there will be sometimes less and sometimes more. \nGeorge Carlin said, \u201cthink of how dumb the average person is. \nWell half of them are dumber than that.\u201d \nWith the 1 out of 10 hypothesis, I'm taking it farther than that. \n\nThere are some interesting aspects that arise as a result of applying this idea. \n\n   First, I find, that in applying it to the self, I cannot be certain to which group I belong. \nI know to which group I wish to belong but let's not make any assumptions. \nI know where that leads. \nThere are tests I can take, which will narrow it down. \nIn the end I've found no way to be sure. \nThe only statement I can make is that I would like to belong to the 1 out of 10. \nSo, already, I have provided myself with the inspiration to strive to be something \nother than a worthless idiot. This, in my opinion, is progress. \nIsn't that what most of us want? I don't know, I'm only me. \n\n   Second, this removes the need for inferiority complexes.\nInstead of comparing myself to others, it becomes more useful to compare others to me.\nIf I am not going to find value in 9 out of 10, the methods of search must change.\nGetting lost in the weeds is not entertainment.\n\n   Third, I find that it gets to the heart of the \u201cisms\u201d. \nRacism, sexism et cetera are wiped away the instant I apply the 1 out of 10 hypothesis. \nThe hypothesis tells us that it is not any group that are worthless or dangerous, \nbut, that about 90% of every group are worthless, if not dangerous.  \nAgain, this brings me to the same dilemma. How do I sort out which is which?\n\nThere are metaphors to be found in nature.\nRabbits, for example, most rabbits are what are called, food. \nMaybe 5 or 10 out of 100 are the wily ones, the ones that reproduce.\n\nI do hope this does not come across as overly harsh.\nThe 1 out of 10 that I find of value may bear no relation \nto those that you choose for yourself.\nI am not advocating getting rid of the 9 out of 10.\nThis is more of a match making for friends.\n\nI believe this tack is providing me with useful insights. \nThe more I apply it the more I learn.\nMeans and methods remain to be defined.\n\nIf anyone has any reasonable suggestions, leave a reply. Thank you for your attention.\n\n\n\nimage: media1.santabanta.com",

    "body": "@herpetologyguy\n\nOne of my many tasks as a zoo keeper is connecting people to animals. \n-\n<html>\n\n\n<p>The museum I work at is unique because we showcase animals that are native to Virginia -- meaning that these are animals people will find close to home, rather than across the ocean in some distant country. This makes my job more crucial in that I am responsible for educating people about the reptiles and amphibians that they will find in their own backyards. And obviously, there\u2019s one group of reptiles that gives people more pause than almost any other animal . . . .&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Snakes.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj   &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/snake_0.jpg?itok=rxQ1zXVj\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>I do public programs featuring snakes quite frequently. &nbsp;I believe people should know how to identify local venomous/non-venomous snakes, their role in the environment and how to deal with them when they are in close proximity to our homes. &nbsp;Usually, I get eager audiences asking great questions. &nbsp;But, every now and then, I get some idiot who tells me, \u201cI saw that same snake in my backyard! I chopped off its head with a shovel!\u201d</p>\n<p>Are they an idiot for killing the snake? &nbsp;Not necessarily . . . I don\u2019t know the situation behind the encounter. But, only an idiot would walk into a wildlife facility, approach a zoo keeper and proudly declare that they kill the very same animals that the keeper is charged with the care for. &nbsp;Would you walk into an animal shelter and tell someone working there that you enjoy stomping on puppies? &nbsp;To us, there\u2019s not much difference\u2026&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killthesnake.png\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://proactivepestga.com\">Credit</a>\n</p>\n<p>The best we can do in these situations is to try to educate people. This can be difficult because so many people are set in their ways -- plus we have to combat an instinctive fear and prejudice against snakes. &nbsp;So, I\u2019m going to briefly lay it all out for you and tell you \"<em><strong>Why you shouldn\u2019t kill that snake in your yard.</strong></em>\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/files/2016/04/hognose_2-1024x683.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s ILLEGAL in most states to kill a wild snake, unless that snake presents an IMMEDIATE threat.</strong></em> &nbsp;And no, a snake crawling through your yard does not represent a good enough excuse to use force. &nbsp;We\u2019re talking about a situation where a venomous snake is about to strike and you have no escape route but to fight your way out. &nbsp;And guess what, that really doesn\u2019t ever happen (barring instances where someone purposefully provokes an animal). &nbsp;Wildlife and law enforcement agencies are cracking down on people killing snakes, so it\u2019s better to keep yourself out of trouble.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arrest-handcuffs-male.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.mylakelandnow.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>2. &nbsp;<em><strong>You are putting yourself in harm\u2019s way. &nbsp;</strong></em>The vast majority of snake bites occur when people attempt to capture or kill snakes. &nbsp;If left alone, the snake CANNOT hurt you. &nbsp;Call wildlife services or trained professionals to remove the animal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/bud-cotton-gg.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://www.snakegetters.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>3. &nbsp;<em><strong>It\u2019s an incredibly beneficial animal, and you\u2019d be foolish to kill it.</strong></em> &nbsp;Small snakes eat a huge variety of pest insects that destroy gardens, while large snakes typically feed on rats and other rodents that infest our homes. &nbsp;If you see a large snake hanging around, you have a rodent problem; snakes will not hang around if there is no food source. &nbsp;To keep snakes from being attracted to your property, do your best to remove any shelter or food sources that would attract rodents. &nbsp;Some snakes even eat other snakes, and species like the harmless king snake will even feed on venomous species!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ImOj1CKTBqE/maxresdefault.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImOj1CKTBqE\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>4. &nbsp;<em><strong>Another snake might show up.</strong></em> &nbsp;Snakes will not typically inhabit the same area in order to avoid competition. &nbsp;If you kill that harmless rat snake, but you still have a food source nearby, another snake may move in to make use of that source. &nbsp;The new snake may be another harmless species or something a bit less desirable. &nbsp;So why not let that harmless snake take care of the infestation for you?</p>\n<p>http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/09/Smooth-snake-660x405.jpg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com\">Credit</a></p>\n<p>Having a snake around can be hugely beneficial to you. &nbsp;It is a free, environmentally-safe form of pest control. &nbsp;Snakes, including venomous species, are non-aggressive animals (unless you provoke them) that will actively do their best to AVOID people. &nbsp;A resident snake will often go unnoticed by homeowners, and most encounters are fleeting glimpses of the snake making a hasty escape. &nbsp;Remember that snakes have their own unique role in the environment, and regardless of our own fears and feelings towards them, they are a necessary part of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg &nbsp; <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org/_Media/ratsnake-face-1_med_hr-2.jpeg\">Picture</a> <a href=\"http://westernmassnaturalist.org\">Credit</a></p>\n</html>\n\nif you liked this also please check out:\nhttps://steemit.com/science/@herpetologyguy/what-are-herptiles-indentifying-reptiles-vs-amphibians\n\n\n***don't forget to follow @herpetologyguy***",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><em><strong>Have you ever thought your family belongs in a soap opera? Probably! Me too! I unwittingly stumbled into my very own soap opera when I met my wonderful husband.</strong></em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>My husband Sergio and I were not introduced, we met randomly one day at our local swimming pool, 27 years later the rest is history, so they say. Our family backgrounds were completely different. My parents are South African, born and bred, I have a younger sister and brother and we had what I would consider a normal, pretty boring, truth be told, upbringing.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sergio's family immigrated to South Africa in 1970, when he was 4 years old, from Mauritius. And when I say family, I mean <em>a lot of family.</em> Sergio's family is French Mauritian, and speak Creole too. Although they had been in South Africa for a long time when I met my husband in 1989, my mom-in-law's accent was so thick I could barely understand her.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/sars9hbej/002.jpg\" width=\"887\" height=\"738\"/></p>\n<p><em>(my mom-in-law Jeanine, and my husband Sergio)</em></p>\n<p>My mom-in-law, Jeanine, fell pregnant with Sergio when she was just 16 years old. She had an affair with a wealthy local businessman, Henri, who was in his forties. Jeanine's mother, Sergio's grandmother, took over the majority of his care and she was a very stern woman. Jeanine had two sisters and three brothers. Her older sister Sylvie married a local gangster and had 3 children in 3 years, before she was 20 years old.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Young Jeanine soon met her husband, Jean, who was the youngest of 10 children. He had a good job and a condition of their marriage (made by the strict grandmother) was that he had to pay the costs of most of the family emigrating to South Africa. I don't think Jeanine ever loved Jean. Eventually the whole family ended up in South Africa, including Sylvie, who had to leave her 3 children with her gangster husband, and escape in the night. Henri, Sergio's biological father paid for the passage of at least one of the siblings, the youngest brother, Irwin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/lycmzn8cb/012.jpg\" width=\"581\" height=\"993\"/></p>\n<p><em>(Jeanine, Sergio, and her sister, Sylvie)</em></p>\n<p>Upon the family's arrival in SA, they had nothing and had to find a way to create a future for themselves. (Jeanine was a \"chauffeur to an Indian \"witchdoctor\" for a while). They were very poor and Sergio spent 2 years of his early childhood with 2 separate families who had fostered him for a year each. This is not ideal for a child, but I think it was a blessing in his case, as his family is pretty dysfunctional.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sergio's grandfather was an alcoholic, and he passed away shortly after the family's arrival in SA. Apparently he had ridden on the back of a bakkie (pick-up truck) for an entire 300km journey, after which he contracted pneumonia and died. His grandmother suffered from an unknown disease where she became progressively paralysed and died too. She had been a harridan, and after she passed the family let loose and had fun.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/3lgn2tn97/017.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"681\"/></p>\n<p><em>(Sergio's scary grandmother)</em></p>\n<p>Sergio fondly remembers the wild 1970's parties, movie nights and poker evenings held at his mom's house. The family stuck together, and would generally move where Jean was able to find work. The memories of drinking and fighting were not so positive. Jeanine's 2 sisters, Sylvie and Joyce soon married. Sylvie had another 3 children and became a dressmaker. Joyce married, had 2 boys, and then her husband ran away and became a tramp. There are still occasional sightings of him on the Durban beachfront. She then married the tramp's brother, had a daughter, then soon after her new husband died of a heart attack. We have been subjected to the \"I'm a widow\" woes for decades. She did disastrously remarry again, but that is a story for an<em>(</em>another time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/v7jeni6m3/015.jpg\" width=\"507\" height=\"525\"/></p>\n<p><em>(Sergio, Norman and Joyce)</em></p>\n<p>Jeanine's 3 brothers were hooligans, living it up, fighting (especially with the Afrikaans people) and drinking. One night, Harvey went to work at the local metal works, under the influence and fell to his death from a crane. This was not before he had 2 children with 2 separate girlfriends, and whose respective mothers cut off all contact with the family. Both children somehow found each other, and found their way back to their extended family when they became adults.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/r3ifv0anv/042.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"561\"/></p>\n<p><em>(Harvey and Sergio)</em></p>\n<p>Sergio was close to his uncle Norman, who had moved to Johannesburg, but who came \"home\" to party almost every weekend. Sergio used to stay with him and his wife Chrissy over school holidays, but was traumatised by his uncle's physical violence toward his wife when he had been drinking. The couple eventually divorced, and Norman stopped drinking. His wife Chrissy, entered a lesbian relationship, but remains close to the family until today.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/76cim1rsr/023.jpg\" width=\"954\" height=\"721\"/></p>\n<p><em>(Sergio, isn't he CUTE! and Chrissy)</em></p>\n<p>The youngest brother, Irwin, was a talented mechanic, but suffered from serious alcoholism. He married a divorced woman with children, and Sergio's family stayed with them for a while when times were tough. His relationship also ended in divorce, with no children of their own. As his alcoholism spiraled out of control, he met and lived with women who were as equally alcoholic as he was. A few years after I met Sergio, Irwin's girlfriend fell pregnant, but drank to a shocking degree during the pregnancy. She went into premature labour at 6 months and died during childbirth. The baby was adopted by a couple who later emigrated to Australia. They once sent a photo to Irwin of the little girl, and I could clearly see she suffered from foetal alcohol syndrome. For many years Irwin would \"loan\" money from Sergio, always reminding him of how he had looked after his family for a little while.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Jeanine had another child, Ricardo, when Sergio was 5 years old. Sergio's half brother, Ricardo, is the source of the family's more dramatic incidents. I can say with full confidence that I am grateful no other children were born into the family. Jeanine told me that she had suffered a late stage miscarriage/stillbirth, but she had never told my husband. I told him. Sergio has 4 older half brothers and sisters, his biological father's other children, but although they know about his existence, they refuse to acknowledge him.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Only 2 siblings remain of the original family, Sylvie and Joyce. All the rest have passed on, including my father-in-law Jean. (Many of his 10 brothers and sisters also relocated to SA, but concentrating on my husband's family is more than enough for me.) This piece is intended as an introduction to some of the more dramatic stories I have been privy to and intend to share!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Thank you for reading!

We cannot keep fixating on the darkness, we will go deep enough that we are in the palms of their hands. Entertain it, and become it!**\n\nI have heard a lot of videos, channellings and higher mind wisdom about ball of the good that is going on around the world, but I also think we should be aware of both. If you are only focusing and feeding your information hungry soul with negative possible realities and futures, I urge you to focus on some of the more pleasant Ideas and possibilities, because I used to only focus on the bad. I one day say and felt the love in the universe, and have been on a binge of light ever since. There are links below if you want to learn alternate views. The information below speaks for itself. Please give it a bit of your time to see if it is for you, there are many different personalities and ways of learning below, and at least one should have lots to offer you and the wisdom is priceless. Our new currency will be attention, we will need to learn to give our attention to beneficial outlets. This information overload age needs our conscious choice so we do not let our attention fall into the wrong hands. \n Namaste.\n\n(HigherSelf \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37eaIEspApQ\n\n'Teachers of Light!'......\nBashar (Youtube Channel)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/BasharCommunications\nHigherSelf \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBz4vE0S8E1Osn_GiE2QGGQ\nAwakeningOurTruth (Youtube Channel)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/AwakeningOurTruth\nKRYON (Website)\nhttp://www.kryon.com/altindex_menu/Channellings.html\nKRYON (Youtube Channel)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbzZmC-cvS57cWbeBe7XPoA",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>http://i65.tinypic.com/25g9u03.jpg</p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to get rid of the nasty smelly smoking habit. I have decided that I\u2019m quitting cigarettes after smoking for 15years.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>It has to happen</h2>\n<p>Over this long period of time I have never tried to quit. Never once did I try the patch, or the gum, or the pills. I never wanted to give it up or had the urge to until lately.</p>\n<p>I can tell my lungs and throat are getting damaged from long term smoking, and my breathing ability is poor. I\u2019m in decent shape, but I can\u2019t run any sort of distance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My gums have been receding because of smoking, and the dentist has told me if I don\u2019t stop I will most likely lose my teeth in the future.</p>\n<p>Not only do I notice the increasing medical concerns, but I\u2019m also tired of the smell. I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s embarrassing to always smell like thick stale smoke.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The biggest problem I have with smoking though is the COST!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In my State, my brand of cigarettes are $7.50 a pack in which I will typically smoke a pack a day. That comes to over $200 a month, and nearly $2,500 a year to pollute my body.</p>\n<p>Now that I\u2019m older and realize the implications of smoking</p>\n<h2>I want out!</h2>\n<p>http://i65.tinypic.com/23kymtj.jpg</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always planned on quitting when I was \u201colder\u201d So before I actually get that \u201colder\u201d age and have cancers,&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>I have decided I\u2019m done.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Statistics show it will take the average smoker 4+ attempts to actually kick the habit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I\u2019m going for 1 round.</p>\n<p>http://i64.tinypic.com/34zblaw.jpg</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I would enjoy it if other Steemit users would join in on this challenge, and we can work at quitting together. Provide support and encouragement during the struggles.</p>\n<p>I believe that the hardest point will be the 1st week, with day1 being the most difficult day to overcome.</p>\n<h3>LET\u2019S GET TO IT!</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>After reading up on successful stories of quitting smoking, I found that many users recommend a plan of attack.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Pick a day within the week, and stick to that day.</li>\n  <li>Have a nicotine replacement.</li>\n  <li>Learn stress relief techniques</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>SO, I\u2019ve planned this out as <strong>Sunday Sept. 18th</strong> as my First Day. That gives me a solid 3days to prepare.</p>\n<p>I have purchased the Blu E-Cig. I have read many success stories of people switching over from traditional cigarettes to E-cigs, and then slowly stopped e-cigs. I have decided Cold Turkey probably won\u2019t work for me, so this is the route I plan to take.</p>\n<p>http://i68.tinypic.com/scuhpy.png</p>\n<p>My stress relief techniques are to work out each day. I have been slowly increasing my workout routine now that I have been going back to college. I can use there amazing complex, so I\u2019ve been making it to the gym more frequently. &nbsp;I read that exercise is a great way to feel better about quitting as you begin to notice your lung capacity recovering.</p>\n<p>I Hope the Steemit Community joins in, and others participate. It would be amazing to have multiple members within the community working on <strong>Kicking the Habit</strong>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and up voting.

If I used Poloniex or Bitfinex I would have done the same. Maybe I have some serious trust issues but I sense the winds of change are in the air.\n\n## These Centralized Crypto Trading Platforms are Just Too Dangerous for My Peace of Mind. ##\n\n<center>https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ozrRNp2cvPjl8B2/giphy.gif</center>\n\nA short while ago many of you were robbed on Bitfinex. This gave me a serious feeling of uneasiness. This also prompted a few geniuses in the Crypto world to move along decentralized trading platforms. \n\n## The Ah Ha Moment with a Crypto Genius. ##\n\nLast Sunday I had a working meeting with Ira Miller, the Ambassador of [Git Guild](http://gitguild.com). I shared with him my concerns and he promptly told me I was right to be concerned and that I should immediately take my BTC off of Bittrex. Now that was a problem because I essentially had zero BTC. I have 100% invested in Altcoins which means it takes time to unwind. I am one of those people who kept my coins on the exchange because I like the ease of access but I know this is not wise.\n\n## What Does Ira Miller of Git Guild Recommend? ##\n\nHe told me to start using [Bitsquare](https://bitsquare.io/) in the interim. He then told me his team is working on a decentralized trading platform. Of course my interest peaked but he could not give me anymore information than that. All I know is that I am thrilled to be working so closely with a visionary of the Crypto community!\n\nSo without hesitation I recommend you begin unwinding your positions across the centralized exchanges in anticipation of the decentralized trading platform tsunami coming our way. I am going to set up my Bitsquare trading account and give it a test drive. Stay tuned for a Bitsquare review!\n\n## Me Trying to Escape with My Bitcoin from the Centralized Crypto Trading Platforms. ##\n\n<center>https://media.giphy.com/media/l3vRkFsytsLileINi/giphy.gif</center>",

    "body": "<center>![robotee8b7.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/robotee8b7.jpg)</center>\nImage Source: pixabay\n\n# The robot vs. human wars have begun and it's being hashed out on Steemit:\n\nThese comments surfaced in response to posts by the AI @msgivings account:\n\n>\"I can't believe that this fucking bot got me in an argument with my girlfriend over my comment and it's not even human, fuck me.\"\n\n>\"She doesn't respond because this account is not legit. Shame on every one of the whales that upvoted it and all of the previous posts. Thousands of SBD have been thrown away on this and other fake accounts. The question is - do these whales know it? Are they actively scamming the platform themselves?\"\n\nBy this point, I suppose many of you realize that the account of @msgivings was not run by a human, but rather by artificial intelligence. If you take the time to actually read all the posts that @msgivings wrote, you'll notice some really odd cognitive dissonance. I could tell when I read just one of those posts that a real woman was not writing it. But I too, didn't really look into this account until fairly recently, because I was turned off by the clickbait nature of the titles. I ignored reading them until @yogi.artist pointed out that it's AI. \n\nThe Msgivings Robot has so far banked around $16,000 in blogging rewards from Steemit, and no one realized it until fairly recently. I think @bacchist and @reneenouveau may have been the first ones to reveal this AI hidden identity, but it was [@yogi.artist's post](https://steemit.com/steem/@yogi.artist/the-importance-of-physical-appearance-in-society-featuring-new-ai-author-mstakings) that truly opened my eyes to the high level that AI writing software programs have recently reached. He affectionately refers to Msgivings as \"Mstakings\". Another user has claimed that more than 1% of the high-paying trending articles are being written by AI, not real humans.\n\nWhat seals the deal for me personally, in verifying that the @msgivings account was AI is the fact that the account owner has vaporized. A real human would of course defend themselves and fight for their reputation, account and future in Steemit. Owners of AI scam accounts pack up and leave, respin their identity, respin their articles and try again, knowing that most of the whales don't really scrutinize the articles to any meaningful degree.\n\nI was examining the @msgivings account very thoroughly today and noticed that @msgivings had voted for @mibenkito and followed this account a few weeks ago. I then began reading that blog and noticed that @mibenkito had never bothered to write an \"Introduce Yourself\" post. I read every single one of the posts, and not one contained a photo with the standard holding of a \"Steemit\" sign. Odd, for sure. But the oddest thing to me was that in the introduction post, the very first line starts out like this:\n\n>\"I\u2019m an Asian and I live to eat.\"\n\nI lived in Asia and have a degree in Japanese. One of the things I immediately noticed when I lived in Japan is that Asian people rarely describe themselves as \"Asian\". In fact, in all my time spent living in Asia, I never heard one Asian refer to themselves as \"Asian.\" Koreans call themselves Koreans, Japanese call themselves Japanese, etc. Only people who are non-Asian refer to them as Asians. At least that has been my experience so far in life. There may be Asians who call themselves Asian, but I've never met them. \n\nSo, this first sentence feels really awkward and unusual for the reasons I listed above. The English contained in these posts is very strange, but not in a way that suggests it's written by a non-native English speaker. I was an English teacher in Japan and so I'm very familiar with how Japanese people write English. The English that was written in @mibenkito ranges from advanced English skills, with proper usage of commas, to low English usage. It's a strange and odd mix of levels. The first post is truly odd. I have been exposed to a lot of different English styles that were written by non-native English speakers and I've never come across such an odd and patchy style of writing. \n\n<center>![robot-707219_128024562.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/robot-707219_128024562.jpg)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay\n\nI am not saying that this account is AI, but it does contain rather inconsistent aspects, namely, that we do not know who @mibenkito is. Usually, on Steemit, people want to share their unique perspective, and they usually tell us where they are from originally, instead of just saying, \"I'm Asian.\" That's like me saying, \"I'm North American.\" Let's face it, no one says it. This all could be cleared up quite fast with a video or a standard introduce yourself post, complete with a Steemit sign.\n\nThis is not meant to be some kind of inquisition, but seeing as how the Steemit community paid out $16,000 to a robot whose owner has abandoned the platform, it's in our best interest to question the identity of posters, especially ones which are receiving massive payouts.\n\nThe word on the street from professional writers is that Steemit is attracting greedy scammers. And unfortunately, the quality is just not up to par yet with Medium. When whale voters, and the curation projects that dole out their funds don't take a close look at what they're voting on, we arrive in the situation of a robot making over $16,000. And now that robot is no where to be seen. The owner of @msgivings has abandoned his/her account. \n\n# The owner that created @msgivings could easily be making new accounts to fool gullible humans. \n\nThe thought process is going probably something like this: \"Well, I've exhausted that msgivings persona, so now I  can create a different persona, with different hobbies and interests, and as long as I fool the whale curation bots for a while, I'm good. I'll just take out the funds anyway.\"\n\n# I think we all deserve to know who was behind the @msgivings account. \n\n<center>![pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg)</center>\n\nThe proper thing to do would be to just come forward and tell the truth. **Describe the entire process, in all its gritty details.** Describe your elation when you discovered that an AI writing program could make you thousands of dollars. Explain what program you used, how you got it, and what other platforms you're currently using it on. Is this a freelance operation, and Steemit was just your highest paid client? What is the story behind this deception? \n\n# If you were really clever, you could write a book about this, throw it up on Amazon, and see more profits roll in. But you'd have to tell the truth first here on Steemit. \n\nCould you tell the truth? Is that even in your wheelhouse? What kind of human are you anyway? I think the people who you've incited, people who engaged with you for weeks, wrote lengthy comments, deserve to know the truth. Are you capable of telling the truth? Or do you operate on some other plane of deceptive existence? This is all really interesting and would make a fantastic book. Maybe I'll be the one to write the book and interview you anonymously at some point in the future. Would you do that? Would you offer up your true story anonymously? The questions keep coming, _WHO ARE YOU MSGIVINGS_?\n\n<center>![head-663997_128076d7e.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/head-663997_128076d7e.jpg)</center>\nImage Source: pixabay\n\n# Moving forward. \n\nWhat if all of us mere mortals adapted to this new AI technology, like most of us will be doing soon enough, and began using our own AI programs to generate content? What exactly would be the point of Steemit? Would the robot wars really move into high gear then? Would the advanced AI writing programs be winner take all? The only real interaction would be found in the comments, but an AI could be trained in that capacity, too.\n\nWhat is Steemit's official stance on AI-created content moving forward? How about, as long as it's clearly indicated that the content was created by artificial intelligence? But you and I know this is a silly utopian fantasy. Big profits won't come to those who transparently reveal that they are using AI to generate articles.\n\nAn what would be the point of humans upvoting a software writing program? Is a program more valuable than a human? Should we all become robot shepherds and get our own AI writing programs? What is the point of any of this? If AI takes over the trending pages, then what role will humans have here in Steemit? Will we become expert commenters and video creators, letting AI programs do the bulk of the arduous writing?\n\nI am not against AI and even I considered making an AI account that would be a robot twin of my writing. But I would properly identify it as AI using the sticker that @reneenouveau created, so that deception would not be a part of my deal. \n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/100bot.gif\n\nYou see, when you deceive others, you finally are forced to abandon your account. Why not create an AI account and do it transparently, with the entire community aware that it was created using AI? I have loads of questions about these AI programs, and I'm also looking to get my own soon. Or would that finally open the pandora's box that's waiting to happen? \n\n# Is that the singularity that everyone is talking about? Or has it already arrived?\n\n# The real problem doesn't lie within AI. The real problem lies within the deceptive human mind who is controlling AI.\n\n<center>![cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay",

    "body": "<strong> Hi Steemit-Community, in this article I want to show you some great photos and close up views of a curious bat fish, which I've seen while a dive in Egypt. </strong> You can find the details of the dive in my last \"Diving Impressions Update\". Batfishes (Platax) have a very flat body, small scales and a small mouth with small teeth. They can be identified on the dark-colored vertical lines over the eyes and the vertical stabiliser easily. The younger animals differ from the older fish by their extended abdomen, back, and tail fins. Batfish are very curious and they often swim to divers and nibble on their equipment or the fingers. They also try to catch the rising air bubbles from divers sometimes. <strong> A really funny fish! :) </strong>\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong> [German] Hallo Steemit-Community, in diesem Artikel m\u00f6chte ich euch einige tolle Fotos und Nahaufnahmen von einem neugierigen Fledermausfisch zeigen, den ich bei einem Tauchgang in \u00c4gypten gesehen habe. </strong> Die Details zu dem Tauchgang findet ihr in dem letzten \"Diving Impressions Update\" von mir. Fledermausfische (Platax) haben einen sehr flachen K\u00f6rper, kleine Schuppen und ein kleines Maul mit kleinen Z\u00e4hnen. Man erkennt sie leicht an den dunkel gef\u00e4rbten senkrechten B\u00e4ndern \u00fcber den Augen und den Seitenflossen. Die j\u00fcngeren Tiere unterscheiden sich von den \u00e4lteren Fischen durch ihre ausgezogenen Bauch-, R\u00fccken- und Schwanzflossen. Fledermausfische sind sehr neugierig und es wird oft beobachtet, dass sie Tauchern nachschwimmen und an deren Ausr\u00fcstung oder den Fingern knabbern. Sie probieren auch gerne mal nach den aufsteigenden Luftblasen von Tauchern zu schnappen. <strong> Ein sehr lustiger Fisch! :) </strong>\n\n<hr>\nClose-Up Views: <br>\n[German] Nahmaufnahmen:\n\n<a

He also gains the ability to tame the predators of Oros. There are two tribes that threaten the Winja's existence which are; the Udam tribe who are cannibals and prey on the Wenja, then there is the izila tribe who like to sacrifice the Winja using fire. Your goal is to grow your tribe, and wipe out the rival tribes so that yours can survive.\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=s3ke52\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/s3ke52.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the map of Oros </center>\n<br/>\n## Gameplay\n___\nWhen you start the game you start with nothing. So you have to craft your own weapons/tools in order to defend yourself, either from predatory animals or rival tribesmen and tribeswomen. Once you have crafted the bare essentials you then have to start taking territory for the wenja. You do this by clearing out camps, and bonfires.\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=rhlw86\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/rhlw86.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the crafting Menu, here is where you craft items </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=w7e6ps\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/w7e6ps.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the Skills Menu, this is where you can level up Takkar. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2hx3g21\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/2hx3g21.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is where you can upgrade your village to get even more added benefits </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=1534mkh\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/1534mkh.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This where you can look at the resources that you have on hand. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2hgfg2x\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/2hgfg2x.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> You can use an owl to scout an enemy encampment, and tag enemy positions. So that you can get them drop on them. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=353cavc\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/353cavc.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is the Beast Selection Menu, here you can select between beasts that you have tamed. </center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<center> <a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2e3o750\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/2e3o750.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a> </center>\n###### <center> This is my preferred beast, it is a Bloodfanged Sabortooth cat. Isn't he/she (I do not no its gender because you can not check) cute? </center>\n<br/>\n## Presentation\n___\nI like how the game looks, and how it behaves. For example when you are hunting animals, and hit one with a arrow usually in other games the animal tries and runs away, but in this game you can hit it with one arrow but does kill it right away you can fallow its blood trail until it drops dead. Not many games do that.\n## Final Thoughts\n___\nThere isn't many games that use a prehistoric setting like this, and for that I love it for that reason alone. If you want to give this game a try you can get it for PS4; XBOX ONE, an PC for around $60.\nSide Notes\n___\nThe Steem that I receive from these posts allows me to purchase new games, and this helps keep my posts consistent. Also if you want to talk about games in general my information is below, and if anyone is curious I take my own screenshots.\n# @tygergamer\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GWcS5Dm.jpg\n[tygergamer on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ty.miller.3720190)\n[Join Our Steemit Gaming Channel](https://steemit.chat/channel/gaming)\nIf you have PSN my username is tyger1313\n# Thank you to everyone for your continuing  support.",

Yet, sometimes, perceived injustice may lead in the right direction.\n\n![paper](https://source.unsplash.com/4fwRyKISwfk)\n<H4>Behold, the Agora! Voluntary, Free Exchange...</H4>\n<H5>Photo courtesy of [Juan ignacio Tapia](https://unsplash.com/@juanitapia) and [http://unsplash.com](http://unsplash.com)</H5>\n\n<H3>When I first began to create things of value, I wondered how to avoid the omnipresence of taxation.</H3>\n\nI had grown up in America in the 1950's, living my early years in a [pre-sales tax New York State](http://cber.bus.utk.edu/staff/mnmecon338/foxipt.pdf). That price tag you saw? It was *exactly* the amount you paid, imagine that!\n\nLike a frog in a warming pot, I was insensitive to the oppressive encroachment of taxes and regulations. For the typical young family, the federal tax system seemed to be a positive thing. Fill out your tax form and discover you have an [\"earned income credit.\"](https://www.taxact.com/tax-information/about-your-taxes/earned-income-credit.asp) You actually end up getting more money back than you put in!\n\n<H3>But try creating something new and valuable, and you'll soon find that the tax man is out to get you.</H3>\n\nIt was the mid 1970s, the outset of the computer revolution. I wrote and began selling several computer software titles by mail order. It soon became clear; this would be a losing proposition if the government got all they wanted. I began itemizing and digging for every deduction possible.\n\nTo my frustration, the software biz never quite \"took off\" for me, and I found myself back in the workforce. My employers somehow [seemed to believe it was OK to withhold part of my wage](https://steemit.com/taxes/@creatr/revolutionary-perspective-on-tax-withholding) and hand it over to the government. \"Oh, you want his money? Here you go!\"\n\n<H3>Decades of suffering ensued.</H3>\n\nI groaned under the tax burden, but found little or no sympathy or remedy. It seemed *so* unjust, but I kept on hearing [(even from the pulpit)](https://steemit.com/taxes/@creatr/revolutionary-perspective-on-tax-withholding) that this was \"the price of civilization.\" They said I \"owed\" taxes as a debt to the government.\n\nNot much changed until one day I began to get wind of the truth. I stumbled across the \"patriot movement,\" which led me to some of the pioneers of \"Tax Honesty.\"\n\nAttending a meeting conducted by [The Free Enterprise Society](http://freeenterprisesociety.com), I learned that (despite the maze of complex and confusing laws)\n<H3> I didn't *owe* the government *anything*.</H3>\n\nBut, knowing something to be true, and acting on that knowledge, turned out to be very different things.\n\n<H3>*Next Time* - Part 2: Tax Honesty</H3>\n---\n<H4>About This Series</H4>\nI'll be telling more of the story of my journey to voluntaryism than I've told anywhere before. I intend to include some strategies and examples, and hope to inspire you to action.\n\n[**Follow creatr? Click Here.**](https://steemit.com/@creatr)\n\nComments, questions?

Many have favored gold as an alternative allocation in a world where $13 trillion-worth of debt is negative yielding, interest rates are artificially suppressed and we\u2019re on the brink of major wars.\n\nThe newest addition to this gold-loving billionaire's club, is none other than hedge-fund manager Paul Singer. At CNBC\u2019s Delivering Alpha Investors Conference this week, the founder of the $27-billion Elliott Management Fund, the 17th largest hedge fund in the world, mentioned that at current prices gold is \u201cundervalued\u201d and \u201cunderrepresented in many portfolios as the only ... store of value that has stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nSinger, along with numerous other hedge-fund managers, has been increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the Federal Reserve and other central banks for creating dangers in the market unlike any in what he terms the \u201c5,000 year-ish\u201d history of finance. Singer noted that \u201cit's a very dangerous time in the global economy and global financial markets.\"\n\nThis quote is frighteningly similar to the response given by Donald Trump on Fox Business not long ago when he was asked if he had money in the market. He answered, \u201cI did, but I got out,\u201d and then went on to say that he expected \u201cvery scary scenarios\u201d for investors.\n\nSinger also stated that he thinks owning medium- to long-term first world debt is a \u201creally bad idea\u201d... and then proceeded to tell listeners to sell their 30-year bonds.\n\nEarlier in the conference, prior to Singer, Ray Dalio who is the manager of the largest hedge fund in the world, Bridgewater Capital, was also vocal about the diminishing returns provided by government debt held by central banks. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can squeeze out of the debt cycle,\"  he said. He went on to say that central banks are at a point now where their ability to stimulate is limited.\n\nSeated next to Dalio was Former Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who voiced concern about limited  \u201ctools in the keynesian arsenal,\u201d that  probably wouldn\u2019t be enough to offset the next recession.\n\nGeithner obviously believes that a recession is on the way. Dalio and Singer are trying to convey the same message. A massive crunch is looming.\n\nWe agree with them, although we believe Geithner was sugarcoating what\u2019s to come.\n\nAfter all, we are on the precipice of a crash of biblical proportions according to the former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, William White.\n\nWe have mentioned his quote numerous time here at TDV but feel it\u2019s important to reiterate because of its magnitude: \u201cThe only question is whether we are able to look reality in the eye and face what is coming in an orderly fashion, or whether it will be disorderly. Debt jubilees have been going on for 5,000 years, as far back as the Sumerians.\u201d\n\nAs the Fed considers its second rate hike in 10 years, Singer condemned policy-makers for acting with \u201camazing arrogance\u201d when he and others had warned of a mortgage crisis prior to 2008.\n\nWhat he and those who agreed with his stance don\u2019t know, or at least won\u2019t state publicly, is that these shoddy central bank policies are detrimental by design. In other words, their sole purpose is to destabilize the world economy.\n\nThis deliberate market sabotage is necessary for the transference of power from the more developed nations to less developed ones. Ultimately, the idea is to eliminate smaller regional and national central banks. Once things get bad enough, these smaller banks will be blamed for provoking a given crisis.  And, secondarily, the end goal is to blow up the entire system in order to bring in the one world government and central bank.\n\nThe elites have used the same tactics time and time again throughout history. First, they create the problem, then there is a reaction, and then finally they come swooping in to \u201cvaliantly save\u201d the day. It's happened numerous times before.\n<center>https://dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1998_Time-MagCover_Greenspan-committe-save-world-The-Dollar-Vigilante.png</center>\nAnd it will soon happen again.\n\nOf course, the globalists have demonstrated that every intervention only makes situations worse.\n\nWe reported on the blatant thievery going on at Wells Fargo in our last article and noted how the elites were probably laughing hysterically at what they\u2019re able to get away with. They were even able to convince many younger American voters that \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d would be their savior, as seen by the significant, youthful support for Bernie Slanders. Debt and currency crises have already started to materialize, as we\u2019ve seen in the socialist utopia that is Venezuela. If this is any indication of what\u2019s to come, the future is looking awfully gloomy.\n\nAs Singer and others including Dalio have mentioned before, the most tried and true measure of wealth and value is gold.\n\nAt TDV we provide unique Austrian-economics based analysis from the anarcho-capitalist pespective of the state of the world\u2019s economy, as well as suggestions on how to protect your assets in these tempestuous and unprecedented times.\n\nJacob Rothschild, a member of the family partly responsible for the creation of all this chaos, even said himself that we are in \u201cuncharted waters\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to predict the unintended consequences of very low interest rates.\u201d\n\nWe have a pretty good idea of what the consequences will be and we\u2019re taking action to protect ourselves and even profit from them.  Rothschild seems to know the consequences, as well, as he has been buying up gold and selling the stock market and the US dollar.\n\nYou can survive and profit from the orchestrated collapse too.<a href=\"https://dollarvigilante.com/subscribe\"> Subscribe to TDV\u2019s newsletter here</a> to receive constantly updated information on how to protect your family and friends.\n\nIn the end, it is getting truly bizarre just how many billionaires, central bankers and others of note are all warning of the coming collapse. We\u2019d almost begun to worry that they were going to pull a switch-a-roo on us, but if you asked the great majority of investors and financial analysts, they\u2019ll tell you that they see nothing but smooth sailing ahead.\n\nSo, while many are warning, many are hearing, but not listening.  The bible said something about that, I believe.\n<center>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.dollarvigilante.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jeff-Berwick-The-Dollar-Vigilante-Steemit-Bio-1024x221.jpg</center>",

This is best done with objects that are normally moving at high speeds, like hummingbirds, water splashes, bullets passing through objects (be careful!) and things like that.\n\n# Guest Judge this week will be @thecryptofiend\nAll guest judges receive 50 SBD for their time and energy.  If you'd like to be a future judge and have a specific theme you'd like to judge, just let me know.\n______\n\n## Prizes\n\nThese are made possible by the support of the community, the majority of the post rewards go towards the winners, plus donations by @berniesanders the official sponsor of the Steemit Photo Challenge. \n\n## First Place \u2014 150 Steem\n\n## Second Place \u2014 100 Steem\n\n## Third Place \u2014 50 Steem\n\n## Honourable Mentions \u2014 10 Steem Each\n\n__________\n\n## Rules And Conditions\n\nPlease read these carefully and adhere to them\n\n* I strongly encourage you to post work that is original to this challenge, in other words \u2014 take a new photograph instead of using an old one.\n\n* No more than 3 entries will be considered, if you post more than 3 then only the first 3 will be considered.\n\n* Deadline for entry is midnight my time (UTC -4) on Sunday\n\n* All entries must be a post tagged both #photography and #steemitphotochallenge\n\n* The Title should contain \"SteemitPhotoChallenge Entry\" along with the title of your work.\n\n* Let us know the medium used to produce the photograph, it may be more impressive based on what it is.\n\n* Basic processing is allowed.\n\n* Any medium or format is allowed \u2014 iphone, ipad, film, digital, point and shoot, drone, whatever. Once it takes a picture. Note that image quality will be considered.\n\n* Multiple Entries can all go in one post, just put the details under the image.\n\n* If you would like, use the #SteemitPhotoChallenge tag across social media like Twitter, FB and Instagram. It may drive more users to the platform.\n\n* Any attempt to steal others' work is considered a serious infraction by the community, so don't do it. Please don't waste your and our time by posting some image from the net.\n\n* Every effort will be made to ensure that we do not reward theft. All images will be reverse checked, if the image has been found on more than 2 \u201cmajor\u201d websites, it will be disqualified unless reasonable proof can be shown to prove ownership of the original. If there is any doubt whatsoever about the ownership of the photograph, I reserve the right to disqualify the image. It is in your interest to provide any proof necessary. I would appreciate any help from the community in finding plagiarism where I might have missed it.\n\n* The photographs will be judged on how well they met the challenge, the quality of the image, the composition, lighting, exposure, creativity and the general aesthetics which means that yes, it is subjective.\n\n<sup>By entering this competition you acknowledge that you own the rights to the photographs and allow for me to re-post the image should it receive a winner or honourable mention position.</sup>\n\n________\n\n## Consider hosting your images with Steemimg.com created by @blueorgy\n\nIt is the first dedicated Steemit Image hosting website, set up with tag categories for easy viewing of images, and is also a sponsor of the Steemit Photo Challenge. It's also really convenient for copying markdown for multiple images.\n\n_________\n\n# Suggest the next theme!\n\nLet me know what you'd like to see from the next Steemit Photo Challenge.\n\nIf you'd like to be considered as a guest judge, let me know in the comments so I can check your work :)\n_________\n\n[Steemit Photo Challenge Week 1 - Animal Portrait](https://steemit.com/photography/@jamtaylor/steemit-photo-challenge-we-re-all-winners)\n[Steemit Photo Challenge Week 2 - Shadows](https://steemit.com/steemitphotochallenge/@jamtaylor/steemit-photo-challenge-2-winners-announcement)\n[Steemit Photo Challenge Week 3 - Desolation](https://steemit.com/steemitphotochallenge/@jamtaylor/steemit-photo-challenge-3-winners-announcement)\n[Steemit Photo Challenge Week 4 - Nature Macro/Closeup](https://steemit.com/steemitphotochallenge/@jamtaylor/steemit-photo-challenge-4-winners-announcement-guest-judge-condra)\n[Steemit Photo Challenge Week 5 - Emotive Human Portrait](https://steemit.com/steemitphotochallenge/@jamtaylor/steemit-photo-challenge-5-winners-new-giveaway-or-aug-18-21)\n[Steemit Photo Challenge Week 6 - Landscapes](https://steemit.com/steemitphotochallenge/@jamtaylor/steemit-photo-challenge-6-mega-post-winners-galore-or-aug-25-28-or-guest-judge-dercoco)\n[Steemit Photo Challenge Week 7 - Architecture](https://steemit.com/steemitphotochallenge/@jamtaylor/steemit-photo-challenge-7-winners-guest-judge-pfunk-sep-1-4)\n[Steemit Photo Challenge Week 8 - Long Exposure](https://steemit.com/steemitphotochallenge/@jamtaylor/steemit-photo-challenge-8-winners-sep-8-11)\n\n________\n\n# Next week is the 10th SPC.\n\nFor #10 I'll be doing a special giveaway prize of a B&H Photo gift card.

    "body": "Finally a way to get your content seen! Strength in numbers is key!\n\nSince Joining Steemit,  I've realised one thing, the little guy gets NOWHERE! There have been attempts by great members of the community such as @dragonslayer109 and @blueorgy to come up with ways to shine spotlight on users with rankings under level 40. This has helped some people massively so I wondered what I could do to help .\n\n<center> <a href=\"http://steemteem.com\">\n   <img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rDMI2Oi.jpg\">\n</a> </center>\n\nThat's where [Steem Teem](www.steemteem.com) comes in. Initially it will be an online publishing co-operative, where anyone can publish under the @cryptosi account, this should lead to some great exclusive content being released and plenty of upvotes. These upvotes will increase the level and thus the profile of Steem Teem account, until we hit the magical level 60. A higher ranking Steem Teem will benefit ALL of its members as it means each of their blog/vlog posts will get even more exposure.\n\nSteem teem will draft in professional content creators from various niches and will encourage them to bring their own fanbase to Steemit. This should result in 10,000s of new users on steemit, possibly more, it really depends how well known the Steem Teem members are before joining. \n\n<center> https://youtu.be/Xi-EfDk_ybc</center>\n\nSteem teem has an [official website](www.steemteem.com) just completed, and we are taking applications now, so if you're tired of producing good content only to have it overlooked because you're level 36 then this could be the perfect thing for you.\n\nThe long term plan for the Steem Teem is to turn it into a fully functioning [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) , possibly using the [Wings](www.wings.ai) platform, and have shares sold using [NXT](https://nxt.org/), so anybody can become a stakeholder, and curator for the content that Steem Teem puts out.\n\nSteem Teem has a development budget of 10% of all SBD earned on its posts and will be using this to pay for additional marketing advertising and web development. When Steem Teem becomes a DAO then changes will be proposed and voted for by the shareholders.\n\nPlease Visit the official website [here](www.steemteem.com) to find out more\nAnd don't be shy about applying to join. Membership is limited, so don't drag your heels!\n\nKeep up with Crypto S.I on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/Crypto_SI)\nfollow my Steem profile @cryptosi\n\nAlso let me know what you think of this project in the comments below, what features you'd like to see and how you think we could make the Steem Teem great!",

Its mission is to help reward content creators who are posting great original content, yet who have not yet become established. In the short time since Curie began, our writers group has partnered with @nextgencrypto and other whale accounts to bring rewards to these deserving authors. *Writers, artists, chefs, photographers, videographers, and many others have been recognized by these rewards.*\n\nEach day, the members of our Project will publish this list of the posts that Project Curie has chosen to reward recently. We hope that this list will provide more positive exposure to the authors we have selected. Also, it is an effort for us to be more transparent about which posts are being rewarded. We hope that you will consider following not only this @curie account, but also many of the authors whose work is featured here each day. **Please consider adding your comments on these posts also!**\n\nProject Curie's daily curation lists will now be called \"The Daily Curie\". We hope you like the name! Future editions of The Daily Curie will [feature our new logo](https://steemit.com/curie/@kevinwong/logo-contest-for-project-curie-contest-process-and-winners-announcement). For the latest on Project Curie, do check out our [Month #1 update](https://steemit.com/curie/@curie/special-edition-major-updates-and-project-curie-month-1-roundup-12-august-11-september-2016). \n\n----------------------\n\n## Today's Brief Analysis\n\nToday's list polls all posts curated between 17:00 14/09 UTC and 17:00 15/09 UTC. Project Curie voted on a total of **103 posts** by 99 unique authors. **SBD 3,832** has been generated for authors thus far, at an average of SBD 37 per post. \n\n----------------------\n| Author     | Post       | Payout |\n| --------- | ---------- | --------- |\n| [@faddat](https://steemit.com/@faddat) | [[SYSTEMS GEEK SERIES] Roll your own Docker Platform:  Faster and cheaper than the cloud, more rebellious than legal weed!](https://steemit.com/beyondbitcoin/@faddat/roll-your-own-docker-platform-faster-and-cheaper-than-the-cloud-more-rebellious-than-legal-weed) | 616.681 SBD |\n| [@rampant](https://steemit.com/@rampant) | [Steemit Daily Drawing Tutorial - Gesture drawings (plus tool)](https://steemit.com/art/@rampant/steemit-daily-drawing-tutorial-gesture-drawings-plus-tool) | 215.310 SBD |\n| [@shenanigator](https://steemit.com/@shenanigator) | [Doing the Right Thing Will Get You Fired.

In any case, and still, at the end of the day, If you take me as an example, I am doing just great financially. I don't blow money usually, I don't have a great deal of things I need to buy yet I'll stay bold even if my life flips upside down.

I don't know whether this immature opinion of mine will change, later on, however, I truly hope it doesn't. By not having any desire to be rich I don't imply that I want to die out of starvation. I simply would prefer not \"to be a billionaire \" to be my desire in life. Some of the time I take a look at individuals who are ridiculously wealthy and the way they carry on, the way they behave, even if it\u2019s unintentional, it just sort of puts me off. I would prefer not to be that person at any point of my life. Likewise, I'm not showing fingers at billionaires &nbsp;like, say, Bill Gates or Warren Buffet who got to be wonderful at what they do and were rewarded for it. But I bet that they wouldn\u2019t have started out by thinking that they want to just have a ton of money.

From Cars to cruises\". I'm talking about these kind of individuals. I really do not want to turn out to be that kind of a person. These individuals are so weak. I can't see how an individual can think that way. Also, I don't intend to say that one shouldn't gain cash. Money is crucial to surviving and perhaps a couple of perks from time to time. Be that as it may, I would prefer not to toss cash around at each and everything that I see in my life. Once again, I'm pushing on the way that I'm not against cash, I'm against the idea of needing to possess each and everything.YOU get what I am trying to convey right? For instance, I may grow old and have enough cash to purchase a super car with fancy interiors, however, none of that is ever truly going to compare with the 15-year-old, in part separated hatchback, my better half and I drove around during college. See once more, cash is likewise required to purchase that hatchback, however, it doesn't make you a shitty individual. But mate, if you\u2019re buying a car worth millions of dollars, you are so totally an asshole.

Do you have favorite Steemit authors who have brought value to your life with their writing, but aren't raking in the steem dollars yet?\n\n# Incorporate TIPPING into your Steemit strategy to make Steemit a more welcoming environment and to grow the platform. #\nTips are a wonderful way to show your appreciation to your favorite Steemit authors, and to encourage new Steemians. Upvoting and commenting are a given, but sometimes you'll want to do even more to show your appreciation. By transferring just a dollar or two of SBD, along with a short message of support, you are letting the author know that their efforts are not going unnoticed, and that their voice is valuable to you.\n\nI've been tipping whenever I cash out my SBD. If I'm about to cash out $156, I will round it down to $150. Then I will use the remaining $6 to tip my favorite minnow authors. You could do it this way, or tip once a week or once a month, or just tip for a really great article whenever you find one. You could tip people for leaving really insightful comments on your own posts, as well. \n\n# Guidelines for tipping #\n\n* DON'T tip a whale, or a large dolphin. This will most likely be seen as vote-begging, and that's not cool. If you want to show your appreciation to a whale or dolphin, leave them a thoughtful comment.\n* DON'T tip with the expectation of any kind of return in mind. Just do it to show appreciation or offer encouragement.\n* DO write a brief explanation for your tip in the memo field when you perform the transfer. Something as simple as \"Here's a tip, I like your work!\" will suffice. Additionally, if you are tipping because you really loved a particular article, you could comment on that article to let the author know that you have tipped them. Otherwise the author will not know you have tipped them until the next time they check their wallet. (This can be good, too, if you want your tip to be more of a surprise.)\n\n# Your tips inspire more tips! #\nWhen you tip a new author, you are welcoming them to the Steemit community and encouraging them to keep trying. They might not be able to \"pay it forward\" right away, but once they achieve some success on Steemit, chances are they will incorporate tipping into their Steemit strategy, as well. The more people do this, the more of a welcoming environment Steemit will become to new authors, and the more Steemit will grow as a platform.\n\n# You can ask for tips, too! (Do it in a nice, friendly, lighthearted way--not a desperate or demanding way.) #\nOn many of my posts, I include a handy link at the bottom that encourages readers to tip me if they found my content valuable. I haven't received any tips yet, but that's okay. I do this more as a way to encourage a culture of tipping, than of actually getting tips (though I do love getting tipped--who doesn't?)\n\nIf you want to try this on your posts, you can build a custom link <a href=\"http://steempay.io/generate\">here.</a> It only takes a second, and then you can copy the code and paste it to the bottom of all your posts.\n\nThe really cool thing about having a digital tip jar at the bottom of each of your posts, is that ***non-Steemians*** can tip you for your work. People who find your post through Google, Facebook, or wherever. This can help monetize your content beyond the Steemit readership.\n\n# What do you think? Is tipping a good strategy for making growing the Steemit platform and making the Steemit community more welcoming? What are some other ways to do this? Let me know in the comments. #",

Allgemein ist ja auch eine der ersten Fragen in vielen Diskussionen: \"Was ist denn mit den Bed\u00fcrftigen wenn es keinen Staat gibt?\" Ich denke eben keineswegs das man die Menschen dazu zwingen muss anderen zu helfen und halte es auch f\u00fcr obsolet andere dazu zu zwingen jemand zu helfen. Hilfe ist aus meiner Sicht immer freiwillig und ich sehe keinen Grund jemand dazu zu zwingen anderen zu helfen, dazu hat niemand ein Recht.

It was a conspiracy. A group of people conspired to murder thousands of civilians. Whether it was Al Qaeda, the U.S. Government, The New World Order or alien lizard people; it was a conspiracy.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/ObamaLizardfae8e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"/></center></p>\n<p>Any attempt to explain the events of that day without total and complete knowledge is a conspiracy theory. So we're all conspiracy theorists, okay? Let's move on.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Casting Doubt on Common Conspiracy Theories</h1>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg/552px-UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg\" width=\"552\" height=\"480\"/></center></p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to pretend to be an expert. I\u2019m no scientist, I\u2019m not an architect, and I wasn\u2019t there. But my own research tells me that there\u2019s a lot of reason to doubt some of the popular theories. I\u2019ll mostly be focusing on the claim that 9/11 was a controlled demolition.</p>\n<p>No, the towers did not collapse at freefall speed. They fell at almost half the rate of a freefall. This factoid may not convince anyone that there was no foul play, but if you want to make a case, <strong>don\u2019t rely on bad arguments that are so easy to disprove.</strong></p>\n<p>Stop saying that \u201cjet fuel can\u2019t melt steel beams.\u201d Everybody knows that. <strong>No one is claiming that jet fuel melted any steel beams</strong>. All it takes to cause significant damage and even collapse is a loss of structural integrity. Sure, steel will only melt at 2750\u00b0F, <em>but it will bend and buckle and</em><a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a6384/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center/\"><em> far lower temperatures</em></a>. Steel loses about 50% of its strength at 1100\u00b0F. Jet fuel burns at temperatures between 800\u00b0F and 1500\u00b0F.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To dispel another argument; explosions of dust coming out of the building as it collapsed is not proof that the building was lined with explosives. Such explosions would occur as the collapsing floors pancaked on top of each other, shooting out air and debris.</p>\n<p><h3>\u201cWhat about Building 7?\u201d you ask, \u201cAh ha! Checkmate!\u201d</h3></p>\n<p>Again, I\u2019m no expert. But here\u2019s a quote from people who might know a bit more than you and me. You can take or leave this analysis, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not trying to convert anyone to a certain way of thinking, I\u2019m just saying things aren\u2019t so clear cut, and people aren\u2019t \u201cstupid sheeple\u201d for believing one story over another.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many conspiracy theorists point to FEMA's preliminary report, which said there was relatively light damage to WTC 7 prior to its collapse. With the benefit of more time and resources, NIST researchers now support the working hypothesis that WTC 7 was far more compromised by falling debris than the FEMA report indicated. \"The most important thing we found was that there was, in fact, physical damage to the south face of building 7,\" NIST's Sunder tells PM. \"On about a third of the face to the center and to the bottom\u2014approximately 10 stories\u2014about 25 percent of the depth of the building was scooped out.\" NIST also discovered previously undocumented damage to WTC 7's upper stories and its southwest corner.</p>\n<p>NIST investigators believe a combination of intense fire and severe structural damage contributed to the collapse, though assigning the exact proportion requires more research. But NIST's analysis suggests the fall of WTC 7 was an example of \"progressive collapse,\" a process in which the failure of parts of a structure ultimately creates strains that cause the entire building to come down. Videos of the fall of WTC 7 show cracks, or \"kinks,\" in the building's facade just before the two penthouses disappeared into the structure, one after the other. The entire building fell in on itself, with the slumping east side of the structure pulling down the west side in a diagonal collapse.</p>\n<p>According to NIST, there was one primary reason for the building's failure: In an unusual design, the columns near the visible kinks were carrying exceptionally large loads, roughly 2000 sq. ft. of floor area for each floor. \"What our preliminary analysis has shown is that if you take out just one column on one of the lower floors,\" Sunder notes, \"it could cause a vertical progression of collapse so that the entire section comes down.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Source: </em><a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a6384/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center/\"><em>Popular Mechanics</em></a></p>\n<p>The truth is I have a lot of trouble believing that the government would be competent enough to pull of a demolition conspiracy of this magnitude, let alone keep it a secret for 15+ years.</p>\n<p>I see so many conspiracy theorists touting shaky interpretations of photos and videos as hard evidence and building entire narratives around them. Conjecture based on no evidence (or a layman\u2019s bad understanding of photographs and videos) is not more valuable or more likely to be true than even the difficult-to-trust state sources.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Don\u2019t fight fishy evidence with fishy evidence.</strong></em></p>\n<h1><strong>Did the Government Have Foreknowledge?</strong></h1>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Defense.gov_News_Photo_010917-D-9880W-034.jpg/624px-Defense.gov_News_Photo_010917-D-9880W-034.jpg\" width=\"624\" height=\"480\"/></center></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t believe that there was a controlled demolition. But that doesn\u2019t mean I discount all possibility of a conspiracy within the government.</p>\n<p>President George W. Bush said, \u201cNobody in our government at least, and I don't think the prior government, could envisage flying air planes into buildings.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t alone in making this claim. Both an Air Force general, FBI director Robert Mueller, and National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice claimed that they could never have predicted an attack where the perpetrators used airplanes as missiles.</p>\n<p>These statements are <em>demonstrably false</em>.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to list all of the warning signs that the government had. A simple Google search or a peak at this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theories\">Wikipedia page</a> will give you everything you need to know. I will tell you that through the 90s there was more than one plot by individuals or \u201cterrorist groups\u201d to use airplanes to attack U.S. targets. On top of this, NORAD had run a war gam scenario in which a hijacked commercial airliner crashed into The Pentagon.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2026My ass they never considered the possibility.</strong></p>\n<p>The U.S. Government also received <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/2002/05/17/clues-alerted-white-house-to-potential-attacks.html\">many warnings</a> specifically about the 9/11 attack in the months preceding it from foreign intelligence agencies. The attack should not have been a surprise.</p>\n<p>This begs the question: why would all of these top government officials universally make the claim that they had no warning when it\u2019s clear that the CIA and FBI had plenty of information that said otherwise? I\u2019ll leave you to ponder that question for yourself.</p>\n<p>I have my suspicions but I won\u2019t make absolute claims about things that I don\u2019t really know.</p>\n<p>Not only is there some shady evidence of government foreknowledge, but there was an unusually high number of shares in airlines and insurance companies <a href=\"http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/sept11/londontimes_insidertrading.html\">traded just before the attack</a>. Oh, but don\u2019t worry, a U.S. Government official said that there was no malfeasance. Everything is perfectly normal and above-board here, thank you very much.</p>\n<p>You can make of this evidence whatever you will.</p>\n<h1>What Do We Know?</h1>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/September_11_2001_just_collapsed.jpg/319px-September_11_2001_just_collapsed.jpg\" width=\"319\" height=\"480\"/></center></p>\n<p>Despite the claims of the rare conspiracy theorist, it is almost universally agreed upon that 4 airplanes crashed on September 11th: two into the Twin Towers, one into The Pentagon and another into an empty field.</p>\n<p>The government (and possibly other wealthy elites) had at least some foreknowledge of the attack. Whether or not their foreknowledge was specific enough to warrant action is a matter for debate.</p>\n<p>The U.S. (and other governments) have proven that it is not beyond their moral threshold or capabilities to target their own citizens to achieve political gain. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods\"><em>Operation Northwoods</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p><h3>This is what we know.</h3></p>\n<p>So can we stop calling each other \"<strong>shills</strong>\", \"<strong>sheeple</strong>\", \"<strong>idiots</strong>\" and \"<strong>morons</strong>\"?

Governments sign away their right to give preferences to local providers of services - meaning that a globally controlled media will exist (and serve the neo-liberal agenda)<br>\n<br>\n2. It restricts the ability of member states to use any law or regulation to challenge Multi-National Corps. (a corporation could buy a nation's water rights and not be sued)<br>\n<br>\n3. Privacy protections are completely 'illusory' - TiSA guarentees that a country cannot determine how much sensitive data a private entity can contain on that country's citizens or corporations.</strong></blockquote>\n<p>The entire agreement is structured to give supreme power to multinational corps. Where the TPP allows MNs to sue governments for \"damages\" from laws, TiSA means that you aren't even allowed to cite consumer protection laws in courts, period.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hmQKaF1.png\"/></p>\n<p>Moreover, it gets deeper.</p>\n<blockquote>&nbsp;Any business setting up shop in a foreign country is allowed to bring in &nbsp;unlimited amounts of cash, and cannot be restricted in terms of how &nbsp;many shops it sets up, nor its output/quantity. No municipality can &nbsp;establish laws that treat these foreign businesses different to local &nbsp;businesses (so, the foreign company can't be charged higher tax rates, &nbsp;for example).&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p>Not even MUNICIPALITIES (Cities) can pass laws excluding certain businesses, or levying taxes on certain businesses. &nbsp;So say that Comcast has a monopoly on your municipal fiber lines. Comcast already has passed laws giving them the exclusionary license to be the ONLY provider. Now, under TiSA, cities not just in the US, but abroad, could not pass laws limiting a corporation from holding a monopoly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8235nRD.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"281\"/></p>\n<p><strong>I don't care if you're a socialist or a libertarian - laws like this are only good for individuals who own government sponsored monopolies. Please find a way to fight these destructive agreements from happening, although I personally believe that we're all doomed.</strong></p>\n</html>",

At this moment,<strong> it's lower then 0.60$</strong> (meaning 1SBD is worth 0.60$).</p>\n<p>So, when I redeemed, <strong>I didn't receive 10$ of course.</strong><br>\n<br>\nI received 6,40$ that, with applicated taxes (kind Paypal and kind other sites),<strong> turned out to be a net withdraw of 5.56$.</strong></p>\n<h1>How did you do that??</h1>\n<center><p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/questions-1328347_128043a86.png\" width=\"780\" height=\"780\"/></p></center>\n<p><strong>I used three websites</strong> to have my money directly on PayPal.</p>\n<p><strong>The first one is </strong><a href=\"https://blocktrades.us/\"><strong>BlockTrades</strong></a><strong>. Here you can swap Steem Dollars for BTC</strong> (bitcoins) without registering any account. You'll be asked to send the choosed amount of money to @blocktrades on steemit and you'll then receive your BTC on your bitcoin wallet.</p>\n<p><strong>The second site is</strong>, of course, <strong>my wallet</strong>. I choose <a href=\"blockchain.info\">blockchain.info</a> for that purpose.</p>\n<p>The third and last one is <a href=\"https://www.exchangemycoins.com/pages/sell-bitcoin-paypal\">Exchagemycoins</a>. It allows you to <strong>swap BTC for USD dollars</strong> directly to your Paypal.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure about taxes involved in the process, but I suppose they're not so high.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>I don't know what's next for me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm adding Steemit to my \"start from my 18yrs old birthday earning plan\" and I hope it'll work, but as far as now I think<strong> I'll just continue to have fun in the community</strong> with so many awesome people.</p>\n<p>If you want to chat with me, feel free to reach out at @ziogio on steemit.chat and, if you need help, don't hesitate to join #steemprentice - the channel to get and give help!</p>\n<p>See ya!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/07/87858132601361807091603b8e.png\" width=\"42\" height=\"28\"/></p>\n<p><em>PS: images are from Pixabay with free rights.</em></p>\n<p><em>PS(2): i'm right back to school.

Notice how this si done OVER the original drawing so her leg is still flexed, inside the boot for example.

I used to play around and use this phrase as a kid. Geez...I still used this phrase growing up. This one hit me pretty hard. I had never heard of Magic Mirror...and was blown away when I noticed the change. I will never agree that it was MAGIC mirror while I was growing up...ever. </em>\"</p>\n<p>Here's one person where the line hit hard- &nbsp;\"<em>Well it was a kind of incantation both to bring the mirror to active state as well as gain an answer to a question she needed surety about... I have watched this with my daughter when she was younger and of course I had seen it when I was younger and am completely certain of the verbiage used... \" &nbsp;</em>I tend to agree as I remember it as an incantation, which makes sense as \"Mirror, mirror\" as opposed to a greeting towards an object, which would be \"Magic mirror.\" &nbsp;Here's another along those lines- \" <em>I remember watching it. I remember repeating it, always wondering why the evil Queen could not think of anything better to say other than 'Mirror' twice. it made me think that perhaps it was part of the incantation, like saying 'mirror' twice would turn it on or something</em>. \"</p>\n<p>The effect is witnessed in multiple languages- \" <em>I know I am correct, because I am from Serbia and I have heard this phrase in my own language. I watched this when I was a kid and I remember the line in my language which is a translation of 'Mirror, mirror....'. There's no way it was any different, l am 100% sure. Even now days, kids in my country will say 'Mirror, mirror....' because their parents taught them. I just went on YouTube to find the 'Show White' synchronized in my language and to my big surprise, all recent uploads say 'Magic mirror'! It was never like that! But, I have found one upload from 2010 where the narrator says 'Mirror, mirror...' in my language. Again, I am 100% sure it's 'Mirror, mirror...' , as we used to say it like a song, it's etched in my memory.</em> \"</p>\n<p>In case you don't believe me that things have changed check out the footage below-</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqmIMvWnIV8</p>\n<p>The most common immediate response from people unfamiliar with the Mandela Effect for these kind of results, especially when they aren't personally experiencing that specific Mandela Effect, is to dismiss the effect as nothing more than memory problems, collective mishearing, or the more sophisticated term of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation\">confabulation</a>. &nbsp;It's a reasonable first response. &nbsp;There is lots of evidence even in my own survey results that the general population has extensive memory issues regarding events that took place 20+ years ago. &nbsp;The amazing thing though is that people that are extremely confident don't experience that gap. &nbsp;On one control in particular the people who were only moderately confident got it correct around 60% of the time where as the extremely confident got it right 95% of the time. &nbsp;So, yes, in general there is a broad memory problem, but in the group that usually has a distinct memory and thus feels extremely confident there isn't evidence of a memory problem.</p>\n<p>Well, if it isn't memory then this thing called confabulation which is basically just having distorted memories is called out too. &nbsp;Here we get into a difficult problem. &nbsp;There is often evidence available that \"old way\" of the Mandela Effect actually did exist, even though recorded history says it does not. &nbsp;That's when researchers find what they call \"Reality Residue.\" &nbsp;To Mandela Effect researchers it's evidence of a change. &nbsp;To Confabulists it's evidence of where the confusion came from in the first place.</p>\n<p>To me the issue comes down to scale. &nbsp;I'm going to show lots of examples below of products, quotes, memes, and media lines that use the \"Mirror mirror\" line and some that use \"Magic Mirror.\" &nbsp;The collective views of all of these things would likely come down to less than 1% of the lifetime views of the Disney movie, which adjusted for inflation is one of the top 10 most successful movies of all time. &nbsp;The idea that Will Smith misquoted the movie in 2 episodes of Fresh Prince lead an entire nation of people to misquote the line, especially after having researched the effect for over a year, seems ridiculous to me. &nbsp;While the opposite view that changes have occurred and it's evidence that the physical surrounding is malleable is also preposterous. &nbsp;I think that's why people have such a hard time believing the Mandela Effect could be real.</p>\n<p>Here's a video of an assemblage of Mandela Effects. &nbsp;I've found and included some of the links within this movie

evidence the line \"Mirror Mirror\" has been used all over the place along with the line \"Magic Mirror.\" &nbsp;The question remains is the evidence gathered here indicate that reality has shifted and this is reality residue or does it indicate that mistakes were made in the past many times over and as a consequence of those mistakes people confuse what was originally and has always been Snow

    "body": "# Is The Takeover of Crypto-Currencies About to Begin by the Central Banks?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NxCYMpy.png\n([Image Source](http://www.e-corp-usa.com/ecoin/))\n\nThe show **Mr. Robot** has fictionalized the **\"Powers that Shouldn't Be\"** into a singular Corporation called **E Corp**. This E Corp is supposed to basically represent the powers behind the Global Central Bankers, the true World Rulers. The head of E Corp even states in a recent Episode \"Politicians are Puppets\", which reminds me of the quotation by Nathan Rothschild regarding the head on which the crown of England is placed. Clearly one could see that E Corp in the show is the fictionalization of the **\"Illuminati\"** if you will. The show is heavily laden with [esoteric symbolism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2lZn-ZcJMs) but to the public it comes across as \"counter-culture\" as the main character is the founding member of **\"F Society\"** a hacking group based directly on **\"Anonymous\"**. This hacking group causes a financial crash, which leads to E Corp releasing a new digital Currency called **\"ECoin\"**, the above image is from a promotional website for the TV show. \n\n## Is Mr. Robot demonizing Crypto-Currencies? \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f6gXhrn.jpg\n([Image Source](http://www.serialminds.com/2015/06/05/mr-robot-la-serie-che-sta-piacendo-tutti-forse-troppo/))\n\nNow the interesting part for those fans of crypto-currencies like everyone on **Steemit** and for everyone who uses **Bitcoin**. I think the reason for they added an \"Ecoin\" in this show is to demonize crypto-currencies. The powers that shouldn't be have no way to take over these crypto-currencies so they have decided to wage information war against them. With the countless videos warning about the rise of *\"digital only currency\"* being the *\"mark of the beast\"*, one could easily see lots of propaganda has already been employed. However this new form is quite intelligent, by associating \"ECoins\" with \"E Corp\" they make the average mind (who doesn't know what Bitcoin or Steemit really is), subconsciously associate all crypto-currencies with the Federal Reserve banskters, with \"E Corp\". This is classic subconscious guilt by association created entirely by fiction that is often employed in fictional movies. This is why I think the \"E Coin\" was added to the show, but I could be wrong, so why else might it be in this show? \n\n## Do the Elite Plan to Replace the Dollar with a Digital Only Currency? \nhttp://i.imgur.com/IJJxcBR.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nWe all know the financial system is basically teetering on the verge of collapse. It is the biggest ponzy scheme ever devised and like all ponzy schemes if the Federal Reserve doesn't increase demand for the use of it's currency the system will collapse. It was designed to collapse. I believe like many others for one reason, so they can start the whole process that made them so rich, all over again on a global scale. The new world order if you will, being run by financial despotism and technical autocracy. So, is their plan to create a financial collapse being shown in plain sight in this show? One idea I heard from my friend who maintains the [\"What is Real\" YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/szymborski11) is they may \n>\"allow a false flag attack that they can blame on some shadowy hacking group, possibly even **Anonymous** itself as anyone can claim to be Anonymous\" \n\nPersonally I do not buy this theory as Anonymous is completely decentralized and would be almost impossible to blame for a false flag. However, to fully analyze a situation one must always look at every angle. \n\nSo if the system collapsed, especially overnight due to a hack, would they replace the Federal Reserve Notes with a new digital only \"E Coin\" backed by the IMF World Bank and their massive Gold Holdings, and Special Drawing Rights Holdings? The Group of Thirty, also known as the G30 reported in the [latest working papers on their website](http://group30.org/publications) that they want a return to a **GOLD Standard** just like how the Federal Reserve started out but in a new **Global Currency**. See my Documentary on the [\"Group of Thirty\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOB9QfxsgdQ) for more on this group of 30 Central Bankers that meet in secret. So is it out of the realm of possibilities that the new Global Currency that the World Bank has planned for post the collapse of the Federal Reserve System is a new digital only currency based on Gold and SDR holdings? No this would make a lot of sense to me but what do you the readers think? \n\n## Decentralization the Key to Defeating Takeover of Crypto-Currencies by Central Banks\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KVNo7nE.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nThe decentralized concept at the basis of the crypto-currencies could be the key to their survival if the Central Banks decide to try and take over the market. Right now their is a few crypto-currencies that are from the perspective of a non trader even worth mentioning. **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and **STEEM**, however if the Central Banks created a new \"ECoin\" it would easily make replace Bitcoin as the number 1 crypto-currency. However, there will always be a demand for crypto-currencies that are not \"Ecoins\", because thankfully we have a whole planet full of awesome people who will never conform to the system. The useless governments will always make things illegal that people want and can't buy with their new \"Ecoins\". So we will always have a demand for a currency like Bitcoin that is not a part of the centralized system, but is outside of that system's control. So try as they might, the powers that be can only wage information war against crypto-currencies because there will always be new entrepreneurs that create new currencies just like steemit, that are outside their systems of control. The harder the hidden hand squeezes the more of us will fall through their fingertips. \n\n#### Thanks for Reading! \nhttp://i.imgur.com/k10p6Pf.jpg\nIf you liked my article please join **steemit** and let me know by leaving a comment or upvoting!

Then verse 14 says that if we forgive people our Father in heaven will also forgive us.\n\nThis is basically a follow on of yesterdays scripture (Although it comes before yesterdays verses in the Bible), which said that we should not judge people. We must also forgive people who do wrong against us and not carry a grudge against people. When we forgive others it lessens the stress in your own life, it is good for your soul to forgive others, as it lightens your own burden. And besides that it is good for you to forgive, our Father says He will also forgive us when we forgive others.\n\n\nHave a wonderful day",

In real life they are definitely not the most pleasant thing to touch and being surrounded with.\n\nIt wasn't a surprise for me but jellyfish don't have brains. Instead, they have nerve nets which sense changes in the environment and coordinate the animal's responses.\n\nHowever if you eliminate all of the fluff that people are talking about them, you can come up with something interesting and even fun.\n\nThis drawing is created using my favorite style, I hope you'll love it.\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish2_zpswbrk9ied.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish3_zpsx0rcjvko.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish1_zpsge408hgu.jpg\n\nhttp://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q393/dmbaim/Art/jellyfish4_zpsmctahaql.jpg\n\n***\n\n### <center>  Follow me for my future art work: [@tanyabtc](https://steemit.com/@tanyabtc) </center>",

    "body": "# Deciding to do some Trading with my SBD/BTC\n\nAfter having some mild success on steemit, I decided to transfer part of my SBD to Poloniex and try my hand at trading cryptocurrencies. It all kind of feels like free money anyway! I am just learning how cryptocurrencies work. I have been interested in bitcoin as a concept and aware of its success for about 2 years now, but never owned any until I ended up owning some SBD after stumbling upon steemit.\n\nAfter transferring to poloniex, I bought some BTC with my SBD. From there I transferred some BTC to a circle account and cashed out 20$ USD to my bank account just to prove to myself and everyone that keeps asking me, that I can easily use this cryptocurrency to get cash. But, the more I learn, the less fiat money I want and the more I want to invest in silver and cryptocurrencies. \n\n# Bitcoin\n\nI have regretted not being into bitcoin ever since I heard about it and started watching it go up and then especially after hearing Jeff Berwick talk positively about it at 200$ and then seeing it go over 500$. So I was happy to finally own some BTC but this is basically all an experiment for me so I decided that I might try to play the game a bit more.\n\n# Value of Steem Going Down\n\nI can see that my steemit wallet account value has been going down. I have powered up most of my SBD and I will continue to do so because I believe in steemit in the long term, but I do think I might be able to protect my SBD and maybe even profit with it by trading into BTC and buying cryptocurrencies on Poloniex so that's what I am experimenting with. I could also lose my investment so I am starting slowly and learning as much as I can for now.\n\n# Ethereum\n\n<p><center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/ETHEREUM-YOUTUBE-PROFILE-PIC.png</p></center>\n\n[image source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum)\n\nFrom my stock chart studying experience and from advice on the internet I decided to make a bet on ETH. I have heard more about Ethereum as I have been on steemit and after a short research session online I decided that it may go up soon, so I'll buy. Keep in mind, none of this very scientific, I am just playing around and learning how to do this and am not giving any advice because I really don't know what I'm doing! \n\nCurrently, I don't have time to constantly monitor close enough to day trade so I am only going to buy something that I think will be moving up over next few weeks. I make my guess based on what the technology is and by looking for trends in the charts. My chart studying skills are pretty basic. I look for floors, ceilings, and trends based on highs and lows over time. I look for upwards trends by spotting a series of higher lows and by watching for crosses in the moving averages. That's pretty much my entire strategy at this point\n\n# Trading so far\n\nHere is what I did yesterday. I turned 100 SBD into 0.13731732 BTC. I then transferred that bitcoin to my margin account after reading about how it worked on Poloniex's [margin trading page.](https://poloniex.com/support/aboutMarginTrading/) From there I was able to buy 0.33554217 BTC worth of Ethereum so now I have a position on 17.11149722 ETH.\n\nToday I have been researching other coins to invest in. I found [this quick list](http://www.alexfortin.com/top-5-crypto-currencies-invest-2016/#comments) helpful and I have noticed on my Poloniex margin trading account there are a few coins that I can take a margin position on. I also liked this [list of cryptos by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) Several of the coins are very volatile and some are making big moves while I watch them. Probably from some FOMO, I decided to go long on CLAMs. I liked that they just gave away coins to bitcoin holders so now they are the most widely held coin. I have no idea if this will be profitable, but I decided to go for it because it's so cheap!\n\n# Other Coins\n\nI also noticed that CLAMs are the crypto for a [gambling site](https://just-dice.com/) that was featured in a very positive [huffington post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gambling-done-fairly-how-virtual-currencies-help_us_57cf8253e4b0eb9a57b6a117) and is very active. I don't gamble much except a little poker now and then and I am definitely not promoting gambling, but I do recognize it as an industry that can help support a crypto. Basically I don't gamble unless I feel like I have an advantage. \n\n<p><center>http://clamclient.com/images/bio-photo.png</p></center>\n\n[image source](http://clamclient.com/)\n\nThe only reason I feel comfortable trying my hand at cryptocurrency trading is that I am using very small amounts of money that I earned from writing content in my spare time and I think the risk is worth the reward because I believe like many of you that cryptocurrency is the future of currency and if I get in on the right one early enough, there could be a nice profit. Now all I have to do is predict the future, lol.\n\nI have also noticed XRM making big upward swings today and I am considering playing with it but I am a bit weary putting much into coins that I don't really believe in. Yes I am doing this with CLAMs but I am going to keep this type of investment to a minimum. Still, I am open to any recommendations from any of you crypto traders out there might have.\n\n# Conclusions and Questions\n\nI have been teeter tottering between red and green on both of my positions but I feel confident that I will be able to close my positions at a profit at this point. I think I am going to stay long on Ethereum with most of my Poloniex account and move in and out of some small cap cryptos with a small percentage of my balance. But this is just my initial thoughts on my strategy so I am open to changing my entire strategy as I learn. The title is a serious question - Should I stay long on ETH??? It makes sense to me to do that but I could be missing something. Does anyone have any tips on coins that are going to make some big moves???\n\nI am a newbie at all this so please point out anything stupid I may be doing. I welcome any advice and suggestions that any of you might have. I'm also happy to answer any questions you might have if your like me and just getting started trading cryptos. I hope if nothing else, this post starts a conversation and something is learned. Thanks for reading. Let's make some money!\n\n# Links\n\n[Poloniex's margin trading page.](https://poloniex.com/support/aboutMarginTrading/) \n\n[gambling site for CLAMs](https://just-dice.com/)\n\n [huffington post article about that gambling site ^^^^^^^](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gambling-done-fairly-how-virtual-currencies-help_us_57cf8253e4b0eb9a57b6a117)\n\n[list of cryptos to consider for investment](http://www.alexfortin.com/top-5-crypto-currencies-invest-2016/#comments)\n\n[list of cryptos by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)",

Cada vez que tropiezas estas m\u00e1s cerca a esa meta propuesta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>El \u00fanico error que de verdad no te traer\u00e1 ninguna ense\u00f1anza es el error de no intentar dar ese paso por miedo a fallar.</p>\n<p>Cuando veas una oportunidad no dudes.

    "body": "Ich halte ja die meisten Menschen keineswegs f\u00fcr dumm das sind nur wenige. Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Problem ist dass ihnen bewusst die wichtigsten Informationen vorenthalten werden und der Zugang zu diesen erschwert wird. Das ist nat\u00fcrlich Absicht, denn Wissen ist Macht. Es kostet so sehr viel M\u00fche und Zeit an die entsprechenden Informationen zu kommen und wenn man nach nem 8-10 Stunden Tag nach Hause kommt dann hat man was anderes im Sinn und m\u00f6chte sich lieber entspannen. Das ist unseren teilweise psychopathischen Herrschern nat\u00fcrlich klar deswegen gilt das Motto: \"Brot und Spiele\" immer noch. Man hat nur die Methoden so perfektioniert das Hitler vor Neid erblassen w\u00fcrde und Caesar sich das nie h\u00e4tte vorstellen k\u00f6nnen.",

    "body": "## An AI machine learning program named Ellie spots depression and PTSD, alerting psychologists to provide appropriate therapy.\n\n*Machine Learning (ML) is a hot topic in the science and engineering world and while ML has been around for decades, rapid advances in computer technology have catapulted ML to  being an AI discipline with great potential for benefiting mankind. Here is a quick overview of how ML can detect mental illness in you...*\n \n\nYou walk into a comfortable, private room and encounter a personable computer avatar named Ellie. \n\n![computer avatar](http://media.guim.co.uk/0f255e6e1d63b3087c38ecbec9859b177c462d94/330_0_1126_746/1000.jpg)\n[Credit](http://media.guim.co.uk/0f255e6e1d63b3087c38ecbec9859b177c462d94/330_0_1126_746/1000.jpg)\n\nAfter you sit down and get comfortable, Ellie introduces herself and begins a conversation with her comments and questions.  Microphones record your voice responses and a camera tracks your every move. While Ellie scans your facial expressions, tone of voice and body movements, she analyzes this data with computer algorithms. These in turn provide Ellie with a statistically optimal script of questions and comments designed to uncover probable signs of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\n![Graphical ML data](http://www.npr.org/news/graphics/2015/05/Planet%20Money%20Automation%20Gifs/stacey.gif)\n[Gif courtesy of NPR](http://www.npr.org/news/graphics/2015/05/Planet%20Money%20Automation%20Gifs/stacey.gif)\n\nIn simple terms, your interaction through Ellie's camera and microphone is an operational environment that collects raw data (test data). Next comes processing by computer algorithms that refine this raw data by comparing it to data (training data) created under identical conditions by people with confirmed depression and PTSD. \n\n\n\nWhen a statistical correlation is detected between your test data and the training data gathered from subjects diagnosed with depression and PTSD, Ellie is directed to probe further to clarify this information and reveal any indications of mental illness. After Ellie collects your behavioral data over time, subsequent analysis produces intelligence for psychologists that can lead to diagnosis of a mental disorder and remedial treatments.\n\n![Diagram of the relationship of data, information and intelligence](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Relationship_of_data,_information_and_intelligence.png)\n[Graphic courtesy of Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Relationship_of_data,_information_and_intelligence.png)\n\n\nEllie was developed by a team of scientists at the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) at the University of Southern California. While her creators state that Ellie cannot substitute for a real therapist's diagnosis and treatment decisions, the hope is that one day Ellie will be able to go into the field to detect soldiers with PTSD. She could also assist cash-strapped, over-crowded mental health services and help ease the minds of people who feel there is a stigma attached to mental illness.",

The argument is that a cashless society is better at protecting democracy, by helping to better track and whack corruption. The point is valid, but also chimeric. Human being never fail to find new ways to send each other kickbacks for illicit favours.</p>\n<p>However, Estonia does not stop there. They have also launched a scheme by which any foreigner can apply for an e-residency. That means that you don't even need to live in the country to become an e-resident. The aim is to cut service costs and to cut red tape. Too many people around the world feel like their government's regulations is making their life difficult. Estonia is famous for the efficiency and easiness of its laws and administration, so for foreigners it could save a lot of time and money to apply to that scheme.</p>\n<p>The e-residents can:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>establish an Estonian company online (you would need a physical address there, but there are companies providing that service for 200\u20ac a year for example - and a secretary too if you throw a couple more bills),</li>\n  <li>administer it from anywhere in the world</li>\n  <li>access online payment service providers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the proof of their e-residency is a card which enables to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>sign in and authenticate secure services</li>\n  <li>digitally sign documents</li>\n  <li>digitally authenticate documents</li>\n  <li>encrypt documents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/vok1ma7jb/ScreenHunter_31_Sep__15_19_20.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"221\"/></p>\n<h2>Breaking borders and breaking taboos</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>What Estonia want to do is effectively break two taboos:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>the taboo of offshore bank accounts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Estonia does not want to be branded as the new Tax Haven, and this e-residency is a middle way. For example, it is clearly stated that the e-residency does not mean that you can escape the tax of your own countries. You are not going to get any passport or carte blanche from Tallinn. You still have to pay your taxes in the country where you reside.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>the taboo of immigration and emigration</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Estonian is a small country, which is never going to attract a lot of immigrants. Not that they want it anyway in the first place! There is not the place, nor the will, to accomodate a large population. However, they are very much interested in getting your business !&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And also, Estonia has had issues KEEPING its citizens from fleeing abroad. By setting this thing up, they hope not to loose track of them too much. If some Estonians go abroad to make business, that does not mean they can't keep in touch with the home country through this service.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>How does it work ?</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;The applicant must provide:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>His/her name and identifying information</li>\n  <li>A scanned passport photo.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>A scanned copy of government-issued identity documentation.</li>\n  <li>A minimum of one paragraph describing your interest and motivations behind applying for e-Residency. This helps the Police and Border Guard Board with risk management and the background check.</li>\n  <li>A fee of 100\u20ac.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>The desired pickup location: one of 38 Estonian embassies and consulates around the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more info, check the website : <a href=\"https://e-estonia.com/e-residents/apply/\">https://e-estonia.com/e-residents/apply/</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Even if the ultimate advantages of that e-residency remains fuzzy, Estonia is betting on the future of this initiative to attract attention and businesses from around the world and foster its image as a thinking-forward country. So, would you trust the Estonian government with your datas? No pledge of allegiance is required.</h1>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

How are you going to do that?\n**A:** I'll rent a commercial property, put some ovens in it, hire some bakers...\n**S:** Where are you going to find a property? In this utopian vision of yours, you think a building is just going to sprout up out of the ground?\n**A:** Actually, there are already a few in my area that I've looked at. Some have been there for a while, maybe 20 years.\n**S:** Oh yeah? Who built them?\n**A:** I don't know... A contractor I suppose. But they're there. I can show you some pictures if you like.\n**S:** Well, I'd have to see it in person to believe it. Where will you find the ovens?\n**A:** I'll buy them - here's the pamphlet from LEWCO.\n**S:** Yeah? How are you going to get the ovens delivered? By teleportation?\n**A:** They'll use trucks, I imagine.\n**S:** Where will they get the trucks?\n**A:** Auto manufacturers... General Motors.\n**S:** Where will they get the oil?\n**A:** Shell, BP... there are a lot of petrol stations around.\n**S:** And where will *they* get it?\n**A:** Oil rigs off the coast of Canada perhaps.\n**S:** Oh yeah, and I suppose they're going to transport it by truck too - but they can't, because they need oil to move the trucks in the first place. Where are they going to refine it? And using what process?\n**A:** I don't know, personally. I'm not in that business of oil. I just want to run the bakery.\n**S:** Aha! So you admit you don't know how your business is going to function, how you're going to get the resources to run it. If you're proposing this new system of a bakery, and you don't even know how something so basic as the refinement of oil, how do you expect investors to believe that this is anything more than a pipe dream? Just face it - the whole thing is ridiculous. Obviously if you want to propose a business model, it's your responsibility to know exactly how it will work - otherwise, how is anyone going to accept it?\n\n# How do things work in a free society? How do they work at all?\nThis is how some people behave when confronted with the idea of a free, stateless society - the idea that law, arbitration and public utilities will not be provided by a state - putting the complete burden of demonstrating how everything is going to work on the person proposing the idea. The problem is, they've never given a thought to how most of the systems around them work, and they haven't noticed that 99% of them work so well that they never have to think about it.\n\n# Those things already exist\n[![bitnation32856.md.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/02/bitnation32856.md.png)](http://www.bitnation.co)\n\nMany people might come back with the argument that things like bakeries and oil refineries already exist, and so we don't need to worry about how they will be operated. Actually, many systems which can be used in law and other public services already exist, such as [Bitnation](http://www.bitnation.co), private arbitration, private roads - even private police. \n\nIf the USSR had declared that they were going to de-nationalise their oil industry, nobody would have freaked out, paralysed with fear that oil refineries are so complex, that they cannot possibly be managed by anybody other than government. Why would it be the case with police, courts and roads? Are those things so sacred, so holy, that they can only be performed by an ordained minister of the state? What could possibly be so special about roads?\n\n# A market for violence, and a market for peace\n\n[![ferengirand98aba.md.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/02/ferengirand98aba.md.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/7ZWqp)\n\nThe argument that Ayn Rand makes is that the state's only function is to provide violence, and obviously competition in violence would be awful. The problem with this argument is, the reason people desire a state (ideally) is not to provide violence, but to maintain peace.\n\nIt's very rare to meet someone who wants violence for the sake of violence - even someone who is very pro-war usually takes that position because they care about the protection of themselves and their loved ones, and even someone who calls for the imprisonment of potheads, only does it because they believe it makes society safer and prevents the potheads from \"harming\" themselves. They call for the service of the state, because they want peace.\n\nImagine if you had twenty firms in your neighbourhood, competing to make it peaceful. Would it be more peaceful, or less peaceful than if you had one firm, with a monopoly? Why?\n\n# Conclusion\nUnless it's our business, we generally don't need to know exactly how something functions, for it to function. If there is a demand for something, such as peace, then people can figure out how to provide it. It won't always be easy, and there will be challenges along the way, but the value of a peaceful, civilised society based on mutual respect is worth more than any number of years you can name, or any amount of effort you can think of. We can learn to live together.\n\n---\n\n# About me\n\n[![kurt robinson in the mountains of puebla](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/26/pictureofmecroppedbdb8d.md.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/gsqzK)\n\nMy name is Kurt Robinson.

    "body": "_After Lyn joined [Steemit](https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@rossulbricht/lyn-ulbricht-mother-of-silk-road-political-prisoner-ross-ulbricht-is-now-on-steemit), I've decided to repost an article that I drafted on Ross Ulbricht shortly after his life sentence in May of 2015. While progress seems to have been made in the grand injustice that is the war on drugs, we still endure the brutal hand of careless bureaucrats hiding behind morally vacuous arguments._\n\n_Millions of Americans are still either in jail or have gone to jail for nonviolent offenses. The aftermath extends far beyond the period of incarceration with broken families, inability to pursue higher education or reasonable employment and a permanent stigma of a felon's criminal record. We have created generations of American's existing in an underclass that understandably becomes more hostile and dangerous over time._\n\n_My hope is that the next generation of American leaders can have a more informed, data driven and objective conversation about the war on drugs and its eventual end. We should not allow institutions to exist that promote human misery for profit. Nor should we allow arguments that destroying nonviolent people's lives somehow protects them or society._\n\n_Enjoy!_ \n\n**Thoughts on Ross**\n![Picture of the Roman's Fighting](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Jean-Leon_Gerome_Pollice_Verso.jpg)\n\nFrom time to time, I enjoy investing an afternoon considering politics and the state of affairs here in the United States. Our country is the first hyperpower forcing all other nations to consider us in whatever policy happens to be the day's grock. This reality is divorced from ethical or moral metrics and the war on drugs is no different.\n\nFor whatever reason (religious, practical, dystopian, etc), policymakers in the United States have continuously decided to label a behavior or substance as dangerous to the social fabric\u2122 of our society. Prohibition is the standard example and its spectacular failure is somehow forgotten. We saw and acknowledge the rise of the modern mafia. We saw the decentralized nature of resistance through bootleggers (some say one who's [kid](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/killing-kennedy/articles/jfks-secret-mafia-history/) become president) and the FBI form to stop the bootleggers empowering J. Edgar Hoover to terrorize two generations of Americans via illegal spying and blackmail (including [Martin Luther King](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/magazine/what-an-uncensored-letter-to-mlk-reveals.html?_r=1)). Yet why have no lessons been learned?\n\nThe war of drugs is a leviathan that has imprisoned millions of Americans (vastly [disportionate for minorities](https://www.drugpolicy.org/race-and-drug-war)), formed massive bureaucracies such as the DEA and their state equivalents, and like Hoover's FBI slowly transformed society to both militarize the police and make [their actions somehow ok](http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/us/georgia-toddler-stun-grenade-no-indictment/). Where in this process have we asked what the goal exactly is? Why are we as a country destroying families, imprisoning millions and treating addicts as hardened criminals? Why have we created an industry that robs us of our constitutional rights and turns our police force into something resembling the Stasi?          \n\nI honestly don't have a good answer. There is perhaps an historical context that could be explored and used to synthetically explain why we are somehow comfortable as a nation using a plato like ideal social fabric\u2122 to justify incarcerating millions for non-violent crimes. Yet this leaves a putrid taste in my mouth. \n\nThe United States drug policy is simply put immoral to the core. If drug use results in damage to one's relationships, then hold people accountable for their actions. But instead we say that Heroin somehow is more damaging than alcohol? Marijuana is a gateway to personal destruction (except for when our presidents smoke it [[1](http://swampland.time.com/2013/12/03/clinton-i-never-denied-smoking-pot/)][[2](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/feb/28/barack-obama-smoking-marijuana-video)])? I guess Colorado is doomed then :).\n\nNow enter Ross Ulbricht the dread pirate roberts. He isn't a very nice person. No one running a drug cartel really is a nice person. But he isn't a Zetas Cartel kingpin proudly displaying the heads of his enemies. He is a programmer who saw an opportunity to use emerging technology to enrich himself without regard to the current egregious law. He believed that he could stay hidden thanks to the nature of Tor and Bitcoin. He also believed that a decentralized marketplace could reduce the violence associated with the drug trade (which is fair considering that violence comes from the prohibition not the other way around). \n\nAnd the fruits of his labors were a modest marketplace that was the safest and lowest violence drug exchange in the world. It also allowed suppliers to directly sell to consumers cutting out the middleman who usually end up being pretty evil. Compared to the Golden Triangle, a relatively small amount of funds changed hands and consumers got their substances. The vast majority didn't go crazy and grab chainsaws for some [Tony Montana action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg7goEASO5E). The vast majority didn't destroy their families and social networks. The vast majority are still living their lives amongst us going to work, church or vacations. Somehow the social fabric\u2122 the government must protect hasn't been torn.\n\nYet Ross now gets to spend the rest of his life in prison as a living symbol of the war on drugs. He has effectively become its Nelson Mandela. The Silk Road won't go away. Those who are knowledgeable about cryptography and the nature of the internet will cite technology like Openbazaar and other such systems as the bittorrent moment of online drug trade. Ross's imprisonment will send no message contrary to what the prosecutor suggests, it just increases the stakes for anonymity and the amount of potential profit from the trade.\n\nThe countermeasures will inevitably be a war on cryptography (I should trademark that one) and internet anonymity. To protect the social fabric\u2122, the United States must rob us of our privacy and autonomy. We must accept that all packets need to be inspected. Secrets are illegal. And no doubt massive government budgets must be increased. Think of your children! \n\nI'm really done with this madness. We supposedly have a republic and have the right to change things. At this moment, I'd like to divide the bitcoin space into two groups. Those that complain about the injustice of Ross's sentence and those that do something about it. I'm going to do something about it. My company is going to build some great tools to preserve personal privacy (that thing we have a constitutional right to) and make sure they are open source and well distributed.\n\nI'm also going to ask everyone in this space to be in the second bucket. Do something about this injustice. Think about the software you could write. Organize meetups and spread the word. We didn't like our money or the banks so we made new money. Is in inconceivable that we can make a new society with a social fabric that's actually worth protecting?",

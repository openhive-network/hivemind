This often means using new techniques and tools. This time I have begin experimenting with Pixar Subdivsion Surface modeling. This was the first time that I had really used this method. It is great a making some rather complex forms with very little base geometry. Pretty powerful stuff. Not sure how well executed this model is but I thought it was an interesting start.\n\nThe geometric features in the front grate and along the side was from a displacement texture that was made in Zbrush. It is a, \"greeble\" generator and is great for scifi features like panels and such. The overall geometry was modeled in Modo. I tend to move in and out of Modo. For my main 3D tool I use 3DS Max. But Modo just has some interesting modeling tools that I rediscover from time to time.\n\nhttp://img04.deviantart.net/0859/i/2016/089/0/1/speeder_concept_1_by_ehrendreich-d9x2nla.jpg\n\n\n**The Concept**\n\nThe concept is something like the Star Wars land speeder. Luke's was more of a wreck. I was going for more of a \"downtown\" ride. Something more like a 70's Caddy or Lincoln. It was a interesting process to use the Pixar Subs it not only produces optimal geometry but can be fast to model with when you get used to it. \n\nhttp://img09.deviantart.net/d13f/i/2016/089/b/5/speeder_concept_3_by_ehrendreich-d9x2nnm.jpg\n\n\n**How Do You Get Into It**\n\nOkay I have to admit it was a good question that came from a posting someone made on my Deviant Art page http://ehrendreich.deviantart.com/art/Speeder-Concept-1-599746798 The poster notices that there are no door seams. Oops I noticed that now. That I no longer have the scene files that I originally used to make this. \n\nhttp://img06.deviantart.net/8099/i/2016/089/e/f/speeder_concept_4_by_ehrendreich-d9x2nrb.jpg",

Firstly you will need a big, heavy, sharp chefs knife. Like so\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/P5AUOVq.jpg\n\nNow this is quite simple but best demonstrated by seeing so I have made a couple of videos! The end of the first being the most ***ninja***\n\nEssentially you want to hold your fingers pointing down to the veg, making a 'wall' for the knife to slide down. This way nothing is in front of the blade but the veg.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2YVcaJ5.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/abf8XEy.jpg\n\nAnd to demonstrate in a better way here are a couple of short videos.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ye5QLcEG35I\n\nAnd one more for the lolz!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UYr4DhiDy8g\n\nLet me know what you think!

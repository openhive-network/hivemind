Can do it!\n\nHow? Easy!\nLet's say he or she?!? Will say I want too share my day on Disney world and I have a camera with me.. So a place a time on this event and have them ready a link where this payment should be( Bitcoin) and private!\n\nSo they will have it ready by a code too this link where this person can live watch this person on Disney! And this code can only be used by SINGEL IP gate!\n\nSo!\n\nIf people can make money on sharing things on Internet then I think I'm sure on the money here for Bitcoin!\n\nMy guess is that this will make Bitcoin price go crazy!\n\nI have all the ideas, plans and how too do it!\n\nI need support :) and help!\n\nWhat scares me little is that this can become some form of HOSTEL shit?!\n\nAnd if it does and media picks it up then it's GG for Bitcoin!\nEverything can happen! But the security has to be TOP! Better then CHAT ROULETTE! With all the pedofile and it's still on that's crazy!\n\nWe will do a better work too insure this type of crazy shit doesn't happened!\n\nHowever if people want too have dog fight or cook fight that's a thing that needs too be discussed.\n\nAnd a lot of more topics :)\n\nSo...\n\nWhat do you think of this website that you can make money on you having sex, fighing, eating food, and muuuch more!\n\nWith a private website and a private identity and ofc with a private wallet to receive and send Bitcoin from.\n\nI'm not saying it's all perfect here :) I will need help and I'm all ears here :)\n\nWhat do people think ?\n\nAgatha white.\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm wrong to even have this idea..

If you own the market but not the coin why not own the company of the exchange! And call it a hack. Right ? \n\nChina vs USA vs economic problem = Huh? \n\nElits around the world are buying gold silver and digital currency's! \n\nWhy ? I don't know but something is about to happen anytime soon.. \n\nSoon there will be a sign on Btc because of the mining electricity cost.\n\nThen the Bitcoin been produce, and the Bitcoin been sold( which is non ) \n\nThat's your first sign too take out your money from the bank and buy some of them I just told u.\n\nBitcoin will be the start of a global war on money and some might even ban it for its price.\n\nSo, once again.. China buying Btc and then keeping them on bitfinix was a bad idea! And I think that the true value of Btc is in USA  Canada London( Sweden)\ud83d\ude43\ud83e\udd14\n\nWhat is your thought on this ?",

    "body": "China is buying Bitcoin.\nBitfinix is one of the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world( in China ). \n\nSo if I'm right then..\nThe most of the customers that got hacked on bitfinix where Chinese and for that I can say that this has to be some inside job and a new way of controlling the market. If you own the market but not the coin why not own the company of the exchange! And call it a hack. Right ? \n\nChina vs USA vs economic problem = Huh? \n\nElits around the world are buying gold silver and digital currency's! \n\nWhy ? I don't know but something is about to happen anytime soon.. \n\nSoon there will be a sigh on Btc because of the mining electricity cost.\n\nThen the Bitcoin been produce, and the Bitcoin been sold( witch is non ) \n\nThat's your first sigh too take out your money from the bank and buy someone I just told u.\n\nBitcoin will be the start of a global war on money and some might even ban it for its price.\n\nSo, once again.. China buying Btc and then keeping them on bitfinix was a bad idea! And I think that the true value of Btc is in USA  Canada London( Sweden)\ud83d\ude43\ud83e\udd14",

    "body": "Soo..\n\nLets say there were a website on TOR browser. \nWhere a person who want to make money on him eating food or fighting a bear or having Cage fighting.. Or sex? \n\nOn a live webcam? Can do it! \n\nHow? Easy! \nLet's say he or she?!? Will say I want too share my day on Disney world  and I have a camera with me.. So a place a time on this event and have them ready a link where this payment should be( Bitcoin) and private! \n\nSo they will have it ready by a code too this link where this person can live watch this person on Disney! And this code can only be used by SINGEL IP gate! \n\nSo! \n\nIf people can make money on sharing things on Internet then I think I'm sure on the money here for Bitcoin!\n\nMy guess is that this will make Bitcoin price go crazy! \n\nI have all the ideas, plans and how too do it! \n\nI need support :) and help!\n\nWhat  scares me little is that this can become some form of HOSTEL shit?! \n\nAnd if it does and media picks it up then it's GG for Bitcoin!\nEverything can happen! But the security has to be TOP! Better then CHAT ROULETTE! With all the pedofile and it's still on that's crazy!\n\nWe will do a better work too insure this type of crazy shit doesn't happened!\n\nHowever if people want too have dog fight or cook fight that's a thing that needs too be discussed.\n\nAnd a lot of more topics :)\n\nSo...\n\n\nWhat do you think of this website that you can make money on you having sex, fighing, eating food, and muuuch more!\n\nWith a private website and a private identity and ofc with a private wallet to receive and send Bitcoin from. \n\nI'm not saying it's all perfect here :) I will need help and I'm all ears here :) \n\nWhat do people think ? \n\nAgatha white.",

    "body": "Some steemit posts are just links, others add summary and insights, which do you vote for?\n\nWe've had a fair number of posts by now, and it seems one way we can categorize posts that mainly derive from 3rd party content is based on analysis and attribution. I've ranked the the methods I've seen based on my view of best to worst method for posting:\n1) link to 3rd party content + summary + analysis/insights/attempts to engage the reader/inject humor/etc\n2) links to 3rd party content + summary\n3) links to 3rd party content\n4) direct copy of 3rd party content with attribution to author and source\n5) unattributed direct copy of 3rd party content\n\nOne exception to my personal ranking above is that (4) can be a good idea if there's a reasonable chance the source may not exist for a long period of time (posts on forums, for example, which are subject to deletion and moderation, as we've already experienced with the DAO-related forum post).\n\nI can also see arguments for (4) for small content (although I'd still like to see a link to the original source, something like \"copied from http://wherever\" or \"excerpted from http://wherever\").\n\nNow what's being posted is also important to me as well, so I not advocating this be the only metric for voting on 3rd party content-related posts, but when I see multiple posts about the same content within the same timeframe, I suspect I'll tend to vote for the one that's closer to the top of that list (unless the poster takes a stance I simply strongly disagree with, of course).\n\nThese are just random thoughts I've had today, anyone else have suggestions for quality metrics related to 3rd party content posting?",

    "body": "Quick summary of capital gain/loss taxation and accounting challenges for crypto traders\n\nThe IRS wants you to account for cryptocurrency as property. This means that if someone pays you in crypto, you're expected to declare it as income at the value it had at the time you receive it. If you trade it for money or some other form of property, you are required to report any capital gain or loss associated with that trade. As a simple case, if you bought a Bitcoin for $300 and later sold it for $400, you would report a gain of $100. Vice versa, you can also report losses on your trade which can be used to counterbalance gains you've had during that tax period.\n\nBut unfortunately for tax payers, tax accounting for gains and losses are not symmetrical. If you gain $10K during your first year of trading, you have to pay taxes on the total amount. If you lose $10K during that time, you can only deduct up to a fixed amount (limit has been $3K for many years now) and must carryover any additional losses to offset potential gains in future tax years (or take another $3K deduction each year if you have no gains in any given future year). It's also possible to carryback the loss to a prior year where you had gains (assuming you're willing to file an amendment to your prior year's tax form). \n\nAll of the above accounting is a bit of a pain, as you might imagine or perhaps have experienced, but many people successfully file tax returns every year with capital gains and losses (and at least a decent portion of them are probably filed correctly). \n\n## Crypto-specific Accounting Challenges\n\nBut gains/losses in cryptocurrency can be much more difficult to account for compared to trading in traditional securities, primarily because many cryptocurrency exchanges don't offer adequate tax calculators like those that are typically found on traditional stock exchanges. There are no doubt many reasons for this: US traders often find themselves trading on foreign exchanges with different tax laws, many crypto exchanges are relatively new and don't have the resources to easily develop such software themselves, and few if any prepackaged solutions exist for them to purchase and license for use by their customers. By contrast, one of the primary options exchanges I've used, OptionsHouse, has a very sophisticated calculator that they license that will compute my entire gain or loss for a year, automatically optimizing for minimal tax consequences.\n\nAnother problem is that many cryptocurrency trades are made between two different cryptocurrencies instead of having a common \"base\" currency of US dollars like traditional stock exchanges do. While it's not difficult to account for a gain or loss when buying or selling crypto with US dollars, it's more of a pain to record US dollar-equivalent values for every trade you make between two cryptocurrency pairs (e.g. buying STEEM with Bitcoin). Given the volatility of crypto pricing and the lack of automating recording of a USD-equivalent value at the time of the trade, I think most US tax payers can at best get an approximate USD value at some time near to the time of their trade. \n\nBut because it is so difficult to do right now, especially if you're making frequent trades, I don't think this is an area traders can expect the IRS to come down hard on right now. I don't believe the IRS itself has the resources to assess completely accurate compliance currently or the potential profit for them to develop those resources yet. So my personal belief is that a good-faith attempt at determining a reasonable price will satisfy the IRS at the current time.\n\nIn part 2 of this series, I'll discuss tax implications of mining cryptocurrency in general, and STEEM in particular.",

    "body": "Introductory post for a multi-part series of articles about cryptocurrency tax regulations and related topics.\n\nToday there was some discussion in STEEM's Slack group about US tax rules related to mining STEEM, so I decided to share my own interpretation of those rules based on what I've read and some strategies for coping with those rules. Originally I was planning to make one posting, but eventually I decided to separate the post into multiple parts because of the length and because I decided to write about other related regulatory issues that may be of interest.\n\n## My Background in Tax Law and Accounting\n\nI want to preface this series by discussing both my limitations and credentials in legal issues in general and tax law specifically. I am not a lawyer or an accountant, so none of this constitutes \"professional advice\". I do have a pretty good background in this area: I live with a non-active lawyer and I assisted her with her studies to pass the California bar, I've been filing the year-end taxes for my US corporation, SynaptiCAD, for many years (after first working with corporate tax accountants for several years to learn some of the ends and outs), and I have personally traded traditional stocks, bonds, options, and other derivatives for a couple of decades now. To get an idea just how long I've been filing corporate taxes, you can visit my [linkedin account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannotestein) (but bear in mind that the profile picture was taken within a year or two of when I started SynaptiCAD).\n\nBut undoubtedly, my most relevant experience for writing this series is the time I've spent in the past couple of years researching how to best setup and operate my own cryptocurrency company, [BlockTrades](http://blocktrades.us).\n\n\n## IRS Guidelines on Digital Currencies\n\nOn March 25th, 2014, the IRS announced initial tax guidelines for digital currencies. Prior to that time, there was considerable ambiguity in how to pay taxes associated with crypto (and I think a lot of ambiguity still exists about how an individual can properly account for taxes under these guidelines). I'll discuss my interpretation of those guidelines beginning with cryptocurrency payments and capital gains and difficulties associated with compliance in [Part 1](https://steemit.com/crypto-regulation/@blocktrades/tax-issues-facing-us-based-cryptocurrency-holders-and-miners-part-1-capital-gainslosses-for-crypto), but for the diligent reader, here is a [coindesk article that includes the full text of the IRS guidance](http://www.coindesk.com/internal-revenue-service-treat-digital-currencies-property/) itself.",

OpenLedger is the first decentralized exchange hosted on the BitShares trading network. By purchasing OPEN.DAO on OpenLedger instead of via the DAO pre-sale site, you gain the ability to immediate trade your DAO tokens before the pre-sale is done.\n\nOPEN.DAO can be purchased on this market at current DAO pre-sale price of 100 DAO per ETH:\nhttps://bitshares.openledger.info/#/market/OPEN.DAO_OPEN.ETH\n\nSuggested markets for trading include:\nhttps://bitshares.openledger.info/#/market/OPEN.DAO_OPEN.BTC\nhttps://bitshares.openledger.info/#/market/OPEN.DAO_BTS",

    "body": "Buy/Sell STEEM with cryptocurrency on the BlockTrades \"instant exchange\" web site (http://blocktrades.us)\n\nBlockTrades (http://blocktrades.us) has added STEEM to its \"instant exchange\" engine,\nallowing users to directly buy and sell STEEM with many popular cryptocurrencies including\nBitcoin, BitShares, Dash, Doge, Ether, Litecoin, Nubits, Peercoin, and OPEN.USD. Other pairings\nfor STEEM will be added in the future based on demand.\n\nUnlike a traditional exchange, users don't need to maintain a balance on BlockTrades. Instead, you simply send in the desired amount of crypotcurrency you wish to spend, and BlockTrades transfers to your wallet an equivalent amount of the cryptocurrency you are buying. This protects users from possible losses that can occur when they hold cryptocurrency on a exchange that is vulnerable to attacks by hackers.\n\nPurchases can also be made very rapidly (speed is dependent on the underlying confirmation speeds of the currencies being converted between) and large transactions do not tend to move market prices the way they do when placing an order on a traditional exchange.\n\n## BlockTrades Pricing Algorithm\n\nBlockTrades' market engine scans across many market paths over a number of different cryptocurrency exchanges to find the best price for purchasing one cryptocurrency with another one. For example, to purchase STEEM with Litecoin, BlockTrades search across more than one hundred market paths to find the best possible price at the current time and desired quantity.",

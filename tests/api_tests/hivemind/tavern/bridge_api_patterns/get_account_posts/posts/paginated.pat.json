    "body": "BlockTrades (https://blocktrades.us) is now accepting Steem Dollars as a means of purchasing other cryptocurrenicies including Bitcoin, BitShares, DAO, Dogecoin, Ether, and Litecoin. Other pairs will be added based on interest expressed by customers.\n\nWe expect that Bitcoin will be a popular early purchase with Steem Dollars, since Bitcoin is one of the easiest cryptocurrencies to convert to cash. If there is sufficient interest, we'll also add OPEN.USD and USD Tether, which can be exchanged 1-1 with US dollars on OpenLedger and Bitfinex, respectively.\n\nNote for new users: there are several tutorial posts under the blocktrades category that cover how to buy  bitcoin with Steem. Buying with Steem Dollars is essentially the same, just select Steem Dollars instead of Steem as your input, and when you transfer your funds, click on your Steem Dollars balance in your Steemit wallet instead of your Steem balance (example https://steemit.com/@myaccountname/transfers).",

    "body": "I think most Bitcoin users will agree that one of the most annoying aspects of  buying things with Bitcoin is the slow confirmation times. Theoretically, on average it takes about 5 minutes for one bitcoin block confirmation and ~30 minutes (6 confirmations) for a payment to be \u201cfully confirmed\u201d. But practically speaking, it often takes much longer for just one confirmation nowadays, because blocks are starting to run out of room to fit all the transactions being created during the block interval and your transaction may not be included in the next block created after you broadcast your transaction. Now 30 minutes isn't that long compared to the time it takes to do a bank wire transfer (that takes days), but it is pretty slow compared to the time it takes to buy something with a credit card. \n\nBlockTrades acts as a \u201cbackend\u201d cryptocurrency converter for the BlockPay point-of-sales system and BlockPay recently asked us for ways that we could help them speed up acceptance of Bitcoin payments for the merchants they serve. Long term solutions include things like the lightning network (https://lightning.network/) or implementing a system that determines the \u201clikelihood\u201d that an unconfirmed transaction might never get double-spent, but we didn't have time to wait for or develop a system of this type, and we wanted something exceptionally fast.\n\nOur ultimate solution to this problem for now was to let merchants take the risk of a double-spend, similar to the way a merchant takes the risk of accepting a bad check. In essence, the merchant places a deposit with us to cover payments up to the amount it is willing to accept prior to the payments being confirmed.\n\nThe next question facing us was how to handle such deposits. We wanted merchants to be able to monitor and increase or decrease their deposit amount at any time. We also needed a simple way they could see whenever we had to debit from their deposit because of a double-spend by one of their customers. To solve this problem, we decided to take advantage of several features of the BitShares blockchain: a lightweight wallet accessible to the merchant via a web browser, fast transfers, and the ability to create \u201cuser-issued\u201d assets.\n\nWe recently created TRADE.USDLABOR as an IOU coin that people could purchase from us to pay for our software development services (https://steemit.com/blocktrades/@blocktrades/introducing-the-latest-dollar-stable-coin-trade-usdlabor). We realized we could also use this coin as our \u201csurety\u201d coin for deposits. Our customers (e.g. a merchant) can purchase TRADE.USDLABOR from us and hold it in their own wallet in an BitShares account specifically registered with us. \n\nWhenever we see an incoming Bitcoin transaction for a customer, we can very quickly check if they have enough TRADE.USDLABOR in their designated BitShares account to cover any potential loss if the Bitcoin transaction isn't confirmed. If there is enough available, we can temporarily \u201cclaim\u201d that amount of TRADE.USDLABOR from their account and send them whatever cryptocurrency that the Bitcoin was supposed to be exchanged for. Later, once the Bitcoin transaction is confirmed, we can restore to their BitShares account the amount of TRADE.USDLABOR we temporarily claimed. All this is possible because BitShares funds transfers are so fast (~1.5 seconds on average) and because we as the asset issuer for TRADE.USDLABOR have the ability to transfer it from any account to any account. The customer can monitor their current \u201cdeposit\u201d balance directly from their BitShares wallet and can easily increase or decrease the balance of TRADE.USDLABOR they hold as surety.\n\nAt this point, we've completed all the basic work for this system and it's functional as of today. Right now with a properly registered BitShares account and a suitable amount of TRADE.USDLABOR in the account, we can process a customer's Bitcoin input transaction and send output in about 20 seconds. With a few tweaks we should be able to cut that down to 6 seconds or less. One caveat: it's not yet possible to automatically register a BitShares account on our web site to act as a surety account, so at this time customers must send us a request via email to link their BitShares account to their BlockTrades account and send us a token micro-transfer to prove they own the BitShares account.",

    "body": "### Accepting Cryptocurency for Contract Payments\n\nOne of BlockTrades' primary businesses is software development services for other cryptocurrency companies. Naturally, these companies generally prefer to pay us in cryptocurrency instead of USD dollars, but we have to pay our sub-contractors in USD dollars, so figuring out how to price a contract in crypto has often been a headache for us for several reasons: 1) our customers don't always want to pay us in the same cryptocurrency (even the same customer sometimes wants to change what crypto they pay in), 2) the price of the cryptocurrency can fluctuate a lot against the dollar and this becomes a point of potential contention as to what exchange rate should be used, and 3) converting the crypto to dollars to pay our sub-contractors costs time and money. \n\nTo alleviate these problems, we've created our own \u201cdollar-stable\u201d IOU on the BitShares distributed exchange (DEX). BlockTrades' customers can purchase TRADE.USDLABOR from our site at https://blocktrades.us and use it to pay down any USD-denominated debts to BlockTrades. \n\nOur site dynamically computes the cost of TRADE.USDLABOR versus any cryptocurrency we accept as an alternative payment for USD-priced contracts. We use pricing and liquidity information from the same exchanges that we normally use to price cryptocurrency. We peg TRADE.USDLABOR against USD Tether and add a percentage fee to account for our conversion and bank wire costs. This allows a customer to purchase TRADE.USDLABOR whenever there's a favorable rate for their crypto of choice, and then later pay us the TRADE.USDLABOR on the contract payment date, allowing them to hedge their exchange rate risk if they want.\n\n### Dollar-hedging with TRADE.USDLABOR\n\nIn fact, we also allow customers to buy cryptocurrency with TRADE.USDLABOR (here we price using approximately a 1-1 match with USD Tether as we don't have any conversion costs). So it's possible for any of our customers to use TRADE.USDLABOR as a dollar-stable coin, regardless of whether they plan to purchase service work from us. Anyone can buy TRADE.USDLABOR from us or on the BitShares DEX, then later sell it back to us at our site or sell it to a 3rd party on the DEX.\n\n### More to come soon...\n\nIt's true that we originally created TRADE.USDLABOR as a means of pricing and accepting cryptocurrency for contract payments, but as shown above, we've already found other uses our customers can make of it, such as dollar-hedging. We recently found another great use for it, but I'll talk about that in a separate post on fast conversions for Bitcoin payments.",

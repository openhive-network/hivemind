I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/pastel-of-banana-with-chocolate/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](http://www.tudogostoso.com.br/receita/1660-pastel-de-banana.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

The technology is being trialled in the fishing industry. Photograph: Maria-Ines Fuenmayor/Provenance&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A new digital technology has been trialled to track fish from trawler to the supermarket in a breakthrough that could help stop human rights abuses and illegal fishing.The technology \u2013 called blockchain and first used to power the currency Bitcoin \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/blockchain-answer-life-universe-everything-bitcoin-technology\">expected to revolutionise</a> the finance, property and food sectors replacing traditional contracts, paperwork and identification methods.Blockchain is a digital ledger or record of information that is accessible to everyone. In this case it details the origins of fish and allows anyone to see where the fish was caught, processed and sold on. It does not stop illegal fishing on its own but it opens up the supply chain for anyone to scrutinise.With the seafood industry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/supermarket-prawns-thailand-produced-slave-labour\">notorious</a> for human rights abuses and illegal fishing, campaigners hope the technology, piloted by a UK-based company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/apr/25/jessi-baker-clothes-slaves-fashion-provenance-website-revolution-consumer\">Provenance</a>, could help retailers, manufacturers and restaurants prove the origins of their fish.\u201cBuilding in mechanisms to deliver transparency from net to plate is central to eradicating illegal, unsustainable fishing and the human rights abuses that have plagued parts of the seafood production sector,\u201d said Steve Trent, executive director at the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemitup.eu/i/161238D8BA707784C33382E6E658E98E.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Smartphones could be used to scan fish products used in the trial to access information on their origins and journey to the supermarket shelf. Photograph: Provenance&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At present the buying and selling of seafood is tracked by paper records and tags on the fish. The new blockchain approach sees local fishermen send SMS messages to register their catch on the blockchain. This identification is then transferred to a supplier along with the catch, with any subsequent move, for example processing or tinning, also recorded. <br>\nThe information on the origin and supply chain journey of the fish can then be accessed and verified by end buyers and consumers in shops or restaurants using their smartphones, replacing the current printed communication and labels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The technology has already sparked interest from food companies, with the Co-op <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/food\">Food</a> group currently conducting its own trial with Provenance on fresh food products - expected to conclude later this year.Provenance founder Jessi Baker said that the technology currently adds a \u201cfew pence\u201d to the price of the final product so is likely to be used first on premium fish products, or even wine or olive oil. The cost will need to come down to \u201cpoints of a pence\u201d to be viable for canned and processed fish produce, she said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are desperately in need of a solution,\u201d said Baker. \u201cWe want to help support fish that is caught sustainably and verify these claims down the chain to help drive the market for slavery-free fish. This pilot shows that complex, global supply chains can be made transparent by using blockchain technology.\u201dThe fish trial has been welcomed by Thai Union, the world\u2019s biggest tuna exporter, that has faced its own sustainability criticisms. Tesco <a href=\"https://www.tescoplc.com/news/blog/topics/tough-sustainability-standards-for-our-affordable-quality-fish/\">stopped stocking its John West brand</a> in July this year, citing the need for the fish company to ensure it was using sustainable sources of tuna.\u201cTraceability \u2013 which allows us to prove that our fish is caught legally and sustainably and that safe labour conditions are met throughout the supply chain - is vital if we are to interest consumers in the source of their tuna,\u201d said Dr Darian McBain<strong>,</strong> director of sustainability at Thai Union.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThe next challenges are building scalability so that traceability systems can operate across borders and certifying authorities, and educating consumers that it is worth paying more for sustainably-caught traceable fish where workers are paid a fair and decent wage,\u201d she said.Trent from EJF, cautioned that on its own the technology would not end abuses in the seafood sector. \u201cIt is also essential to understand and support the other actions and mechanisms that are needed to combat these abuses, including the role of effective enforcement actions and the application of strong, fair and transparent action in the courts to impose robust penalties,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "![](https://s18.postimg.org/fcl7ffx1l/ripple.png)\n## Ripple has raised another 55 Million in its latest round of funding bringing it total raised to 93 Million.\n\nThe news has reached mainstream news services such as CNBC, WSJ, Reuters and the like. News seems to be first released 2 hours ago 12:35 pm; Thursday, 15 September 2016.\n\n### News Articles:\n[CoinDesk](http://www.coindesk.com/ripple-blockchain-55-million-series-b/)\n[CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/15/google-backed-blockchain-start-up-ripple-raises-55-million-from-big-banks.html)\n[WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-firm-ripple-gets-55-million-in-funding-1473944401)\n[Reuters ](http://in.reuters.com/article/tech-blockchain-ripple-idINL8N1BR24Z)\n\nAccording to the article linked above (CNBC) 'The start-up is currently working with 15 of the top 50 global banks including UBS and Santander.'\n\nNew and existing investors were involved in the new Ripple funding round. New investors included Accenture Ventures, SBI Holdings, SCB Digital Ventures, Standard Chartered PLC, and the investment arm of Thailand\u2019s Siam Commercial Bank. Existing investors that joined in this round included a Banco Santander SA venture fund, the venture arms of CME Group Inc. and Seagate Technology, and Venture 51.\n\nObviously this is good news for ripple with 55 Million accounting for 20-25% of their market cap before today's rally, the current price of XRP is 0.00001760 BTC and 2 hours ago it was trading for below 0.00001000 BTC, it has seen a large move already price wise although volume is still relatively small at this time, we could be in for an interesting time while this initial excitement settles in\n![](https://www.coinigy.com/assets/img/charts/57dab3f3.png)",

I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/pork-rib-with-barbucue-sauce/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](http://gshow.globo.com/receitas-gshow/receita/costelinha-ao-molho-barbecue-4e3606631417f260dd004c7e.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "body": "<h3>Have you ever had a monkey sit on your shoulder? \nHow would you feel if one does?\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/2akab6a.jpg\n\n\n<h3>I have always feared monkeys, they seem mischievous, out of control and pretty wild.  Our encounter with some wild <em><strong>Barbary Macaques</em></strong> in the Monkey Temple in Huahin, Thailand years ago made that fear worsen when I saw them grab a bunch of bananas from a boy and started fighting with each other.  The noise they made was unbearable it send shivers to your spine.  \nhttp://i63.tinypic.com/zwgcuc.jpg\n\n<h3>Hub knows how much I love animals and he has always asked me to go with him to the monkey reserve half an hour away from home.  For years, I've refused but this year, for him I gave in.  He took me to Apenheul Primate Park the week I got almost stressed out from doing too many things to get me relaxed.  \n\n<h3>I didn't know what to expect just monkeys -they're just monkeys I thought.  We bought our ticket online so we won't have to fall in line and just scan it.  When we got there the staff gave us a map of the place and asked us to put our bags in a \"monkey-free\" bag (that's what they call it).  Confused, I asked why - and she just told me some monkeys are walking loose in the reserve and could sometimes stick their fingers in visitor's bags and grab whatever they could find there.  So we did.\n\n<h3>We decided to go to where the stray <em><strong>Bolivian Squirrel Monkeys</em></strong> are and found a crowd of visitors gathered together around a stroller with a kid on it scanning everything they could maybe find in it. Hub said they could work in the customs - for checking every stroller there. \nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/24pvtsn.jpg\n\n<h3> I just stood next to them watching when one of them jumped and sat on my shoulder.  He stared at me and I dared not stared back, worried he might see his reflection on my \"mirror\" -like  sunglasses, I looked away and smiled when I saw hub taking our pics.  He then looked away seemingly looking for a plant to jump on to and did just that.\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/10p0oly.jpg\n\n<h3>  We walked along following the path in the map and saw more of them gnawing on strips of carrots and some on cabbages. We followed the trail on the map that was given to us by one of the staff in the entrance that has all the do's and don'ts on it and we heard a very loud noise of monkeys that seem to be fighting with each other.  We asked one of the staff what that was all about and she said that's just how they communicate with each other.  Curious, we checked them out and bumped into a male <em><strong>Ring Tailed Lemur</em></strong> from Madagascar walking towards me being followed by a bunch of children.  \nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/107sydw.jpg\n\n<h3>We went on and found a few hanging out on what look a hammock.\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/24eclll.jpg\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ncKxj28rr4E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<h3>On the other side were two moms breastfeeding their young who fled when we stayed and watched.  I've managed to take these though.\nhttp://i64.tinypic.com/15whua9.jpg\n\nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/23rq1vs.jpg\n\n<h3>We made a wrong turn and found ourselves in the <em><strong>Bonobo's</em></strong> abode.  Some of them were having a siesta and we could just see them through a glass wall.  One was in a hammock just staring at me yawning every now and then. <em><strong>Bonobo apes</em></strong> are actually endangered because of poaching so it's nice to see them just having a safe life in this reserve.  \nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/14udgl4.jpg\n\nhttp://i65.tinypic.com/351ty81.jpg\n\n<h3>What a life - they are having, every thing is taken care of, food, water, dwelling even a playground.  We went around and stumbled in what seem to be a gallery and got confronted with these.  \n<em>Meet our forefathers</em>   http://i67.tinypic.com/14t6e09.jpg\n\nhttp://i65.tinypic.com/xmsavo.jpg\n\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/ejx4qp.jpg\n\n<h3>We went through the other door and found a trail overlooking a trail and what seem to be a monkey's playground in the middle.  There we found more <em><strong>Bonobos or chimpanzees</em></strong> playing with their Mom.  \nhttp://i63.tinypic.com/2dlyf4.jpg\n\n<h3><em><strong>Mommy Bonobo</em></strong> http://i67.tinypic.com/2n7idl1.jpg\n\n<h3>We followed the trail and found more monkeys in the glass cage.  One was just basking in the sun and the others just seemingly picking lice out of each other.\nhttp://i64.tinypic.com/2e6bmgx.jpg\n\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/or8kfc.jpg\n\n<h3> They're the <em><strong>Crowned Sifakas</em></strong> from Madagascar. Like the Bonobos they are one of those African monkeys that are endangered. In Apenheul, they're a star - adored and gushed by children and adults alike.   A happy sight to see.  The trio suddenly leaped on a tree and started chewing on leaves.  One was licking the bark after each swallow.  I wonder why.\nhttp://i63.tinypic.com/16kny9s.jpg\n\nhttp://i65.tinypic.com/fpa61d.jpg\n\n<h3>Onward we went and found ourselves in the <em><strong>Orangutan's</em></strong> dwelling.  A few of them were in the glass cage like these siblings just sitting on straws playing with each other while Mom was staring at everyone staring back at them through the glass cage. \nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/125jokp.jpg\n\n<h3> We went outside and saw two of them basking in the sun, too.  We stopped to watch and another visitor said; \" He'd trade his life to theirs - everything's so easy, just basking in the sun, food's on the ground -for the grab and most of all - no taxes to pay.  I grinned - not because I agree with him but because of the naughty thought that hit me ...\"Okay, you may have such a life but then ... looking like an <em><strong>Orangutan</em></strong>, I'm okay with paying taxes, besides here in Holland, I see where they go.\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/2npr4p.jpg  \n\n\n<h3>This is <em><strong>Radia</em></strong>, on August 31, Wednesday she died in the evening.  She's the oldest among the <em><strong>Orangutans</em></strong> in the Apenheul Primate Park.  That's sad to hear but at least at 53 ...  she died a peaceful death - not from poaching.\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/28bbecl.jpg\n\n<h3>We walked further and found the entrance of a restaurant / playground for kids / smoking area / habitat for loris on the loose -  where we decided to have an apple pie and some cappuccino since we look like we'll be needing the energy to stroll such a huge place.  I like the cup with the ape and thought of buying one for a souvenir.\nhttp://i65.tinypic.com/2d7ynw7.jpg\n\n<h3>After our pie break we headed for the <em><strong>Gorilla</em></strong> show and found out that we just missed it.  It finishes at 4 and the lady who takes care of Bongo told us to just go to the gorilla's gallery to see them.  There, we found them having turnips and some leaves for a snack.  A few more minutes the same lady we spoke with turned up with an ice cream and fed Bongo. He then turned his massive back against us all.  The other gorillas licked up the rest of the ice cream oozing on the cage while Bongo hid in the corner eating a whole broccoli.  One kid exclaimed; \"Hey, that's not fair! How come Bongo gets and ice cream and a broccoli and the others just get to have his left over ice cream, some turnips and leaves.\"  This is what a child sees, of course he's just a child, he hasn't realized, Bongo has provided for the other gorillas.  Most children go visit the Apenheul to see him perform and do stunts other gorilla adults can't. Bongo is a celebrity that makes Apeheul money.    \nhttp://i64.tinypic.com/2dw4y38.jpg\n\nhttp://i64.tinypic.com/2ziriaf.jpg\n\n<h3>How the other gorillas reacted while he was being fed ice cream was a spectacle to watch  - I don't think it's because they understood that what he's having is actually crap and poison.  They just stared at Bongo being fed... didn't make a fuzz and licked up what's drooling on the metal cage.  No wrestling nor any struggle took place.\nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/i5xibk.jpg\n\nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/2m3nztt.jpg\n\n<h3>We moved on and stumbled with a few <em><strong>Barbary Macaques</em></strong> who were fighting and making so much noises.  They're loose but far away from the crowd.  These two caught my eyes, they were just there on one of those pretend rock walls in the Barbary Macaques' dwelling.  These are <em><strong>Gundis or comb rats</em></strong>.  They can be found in rocky desserts in Africa - no wonder the <em><strong>Barbary Macaque's </em></strong>habitat is built this way.  They were just there, one lying on top of the other - both seemingly drowsy.\nhttp://i65.tinypic.com/sct10i.jpg\n\n<h3>One of the <em><strong>Barbary Macaques</em></strong> was away from the others who at that time were fighting over food.  This guy was just doing his monkey business - seemingly fishing grains out of this man made pond.  \nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/2z7iqhk.jpg\n\n<h3>Further more, we bumped into photo booths, exhibit rooms, a bunch of Ibis and more monkeys. <em><strong>The Lion Tail Macaque</em></strong> caught our attention.  The <em><strong>Lion Tail Macaque</em></strong> is named as such because of the white mane on his face.  He's also called the <em>\"bearded ape\"</em> for having such a mane on his face. In the wild, they could live for 20 years but in captivity and if properly taken care of they could live for 30 years. One of them was given an apple because it has a diabetes.  The primates in the Apenheul gets free medical check up, too.  It's not just taxes they don't have to pay but also medical insurance.  What a life!\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/25ivy28.jpg\n\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/i1fypz.jpg\n\n <h3>It's a very good climber, this one has managed to climb up one of the trees in the habitat, jumped to another tree on the other side of the water around their playground, picked up a bottle of coca cola and went back to the group trying to open it.  \nhttp://i63.tinypic.com/r1hhyx.jpg\n\n\n<h3>We moved on and saw more monkeys we couldn't take a clear pic of because they were just going back and forth what seem to be rope monkey bars.   They were very fun to watch.  Then we bumped along this long bearded monkeys going back and forth this hanging monkey bridges attached to tall trees. One of them stopped and looked down.  I extended my arms, tip-toed to take a shot but it still isn't clear for that <em><strong>Emperor Tamarin</em></strong> was way above me. They seem pretty restless and I saw one munch on an apple and disappeared in the door like opening to their artificial habitat.\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/v5v6ev.jpg\n\n<h3>  We climbed up a trail and found more restless monkeys,  sloths, poisonous frogs and tropical insects all kept separately in terrariums in a quite - dim room.  When we went out of it , we bumped into the smallest monkey in the world - the very shy <em><strong>Pygmea Oeistiti</em></strong>.\nhttp://i65.tinypic.com/2hrzymd.jpg\n\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/3462vcy.jpg\n\n<h3>We headed back to the door since it was already closing time and saw a bunch of monkeys just by the door restlessly waiting for their caretaker to open the door for them.  It's their feeding time for dinner and so these guys couldn't wait to grab a meal.  We took quick shots and headed for the entrance.\n<h3> <strong>Red Tit Monkey</strong> http://i66.tinypic.com/1z1y0pw.jpg\n\nhttp://i65.tinypic.com/bdqoep.jpg\n\n<h3>This <strong>Mantel Tamarin</strong> has a face of a bat. \n http://i68.tinypic.com/33v2hyb.jpg\n\n<h3><strong>Golden Lion Monkey</strong> http://i67.tinypic.com/2iig3lc.jpg\n\n<h3><strong>Black Ear Oeistiti</strong> http://i64.tinypic.com/2mq7n5v.jpg\n\n<h3>On the way out, we gave back the bags that were given to us and headed for the souvenir shop. The cup is nowhere to be seen so I thought of buying this.\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/inaoaa.jpg\n\n<h3>Until I saw this.\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gt0HajzxDyA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<h3>It was quite a long relaxing stroll that day despite the heat.  It felt like I was walking in a forest  because of the tall trees in there that provided the shade we needed and the presence of the animals that were there - healthy and safe. That day, I had a different view about monkeys - specially about the <em><strong>Barbary Macaques</em></strong>.  That night, I dreamt that I cuddled one of those <em><strong>Bolivian Squirrel Monkeys</em></strong> and he just lazed in my arms.  I had such a fun day, I brought it in my sleep.  What can I say, yes - they're indeed my kind'a monkeys.  Would I go back to Apenheul? Definitely, perhaps next year, sometime in July or August where the tickets are much cheaper than the normal days and hopefully, I get to see the monkeys I didn't get to see then and if not.. I'll just enjoy the serenity the place offers despite the presence of other visitors.  </h3>\nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/nprnyx.jpg\n\n<h2><strong> Curious about what else is happening nearby <em><strong>Arnhem, the Bitcoin city</em></strong>?

Before any procedure, dessalgue their dried meat, which usually comes to us consumers with too much salt to your saves. Cut the meat into large cubes of edge 5cm +/- each. Dip these cubes of dried meat in a container with water to the surface of the meat, covering the cubes. Keep this container in the refrigerator and replace your water every 2 hours, 3 to 4 times depending on how their meat is salty.\n\n### 2. To find out if your meat is too much or too little salt, just testing the water at the last and penultimate exchanges; if it is too salty, require more exchanges of cold water, if the water is only brackish, will be ready the meat to be manipulated.\n\n### 3. In a pressure cooker and over medium heat, saute onion and garlic in olive oil, leaving them brown. Add to this mixture the meat without water dessalgue, in order to seal (browning meat outside), while stirring occasionally.\n\n### 4. Add the wine, water and cover the pressure cooker, sealing it well. Lower the heat to the lowest setting and cook in pressure for about 30 minutes.\n\n### 5. Turn off the heat, allow the pressure out completely. Open the pot and see if the meat is well tender, otherwise return it to the fire, with the covered pot for a few minutes (10minutes, depending on how the meat in question is still hard).\n\n### 6. Once cooked meat and tender, remove all the liquid that came off the meat into another container and set aside.\n\n### 7. Close the pressure cooker with the meat cooked inside, and shake several times and vigorously. When you open the pressure cooker meat should be shredded completely. If not, close the pot again and repeat the procedure until the desired result.\n\n### 8. Transfer the meat with its broth to a small saucepan and deep, add pelati tomatoes, mix well, correct the salt if necessary, and leave on medium heat until the broth begins to reduce and refine. About 20 minutes. The more reduce broth, the flavor will be determined.\n\n\n\n## Polenta\n\n### Boil water in a deep pan and add low-temperature salt and fine corn flour gradually, stirring until it is full-bodied and creamy. Preferably, follow the \"proportion\" of water and cornmeal, and the \"method of preparation\" of the flour manufacturer to polenta to buy, after all there are differences in the composition of each of these industrialized corn mixtures! Porcione container or format you want to serve.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://gustavopasquini.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2-1.png\n\n# About Me\n\n### In 2012 I began my cooking journey in Brasil and studied at \u201cSenac, Juiz de Fora\u201d, in Minas Gerais, developing my basic culinary techniques.\n\n### Later I worked in a local restaurant, and rose to a role in management, helping to increase the clientele base. I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/polenta-with-ragu-meat-dry/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/wmp)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

I had to SHARE this article because of hour bogus our fucked up country is.\n\n45 years AFTER the drug war was declared by President Richard Nixon, the United States leads the world in both recreational drug usage and incarceration rates. Heroin abuse rates continue to soar. Drug-related violence in our nation\u2019s cities and cartel wars in Latin America exact horrific tolls.\n\nAnd then there is the ever-present bully on the block, prescription drug abuse. More than two million Americans have become hooked on the pharmaceuticals that doctors prescribe to ease their pain. Opioids\u2014both legal and illicit\u2014killed a mind-boggling 28,647 people in 2014.\n\nBut not to worry: The Drug Enforcement Administration is on the case. \u201cTo avoid an imminent hazard to public safety,\u201d the agency said in a press release, it will be adding kratom, a medicinal herb that has been used safely in Southeast Asia for centuries, to its list of Schedule 1 substances, placing the popular botanical in a class with killers like heroin and cocaine at the end of September.\n\nWhy ban the mild-mannered tree leaf? Well, because the DEA claims it\u2019s an opioid with \u201cno currently accepted medical use.\u201d Wrong on both counts. Pharmacologists label kratom as an alkaloid, not an opioid. True, kratom stimulates certain opioid receptors in the brain. But then, so does drinking a glass of wine, or running a marathon.\n\nKratom is less habit-forming than classic opioids like heroin and the pharmaceutical oxycodone, and its impact on the brain is weaker and more selective. Nevertheless, the herb\u2019s ability to bind loosely with certain opioid receptors makes it a godsend for addicts who want to kick their habits. Kratom is currently helping wean thousands of Americans off illegal drugs and prescription pain relievers, without creating any dangerous long term dependency.\n\nThe powdered leaves are readily available from scores of herb sellers on the Internet. Since the ban was announced in late August, websites and social media have exploded with accounts from people who credit the plant with saving them from lives of addiction and chronic pain.\n\nTake, for example, Virginia native Susan Ash. She was using Suboxone to help cope with severe joint pain resulting from Lyme disease. \u201cMy life was ruled by the clock\u2014all I could think was, \u2018when do I take my next dose,'\u201d Ash says. Then someone suggested she try kratom to help kick her addiction to the prescription pain killer. \u201cIn two weeks time, I went from being a bed-bound invalid to a productive member of society again.\n\nShe founded the American Kratom Society in 2014 to help keep this herbal lifeline legal. Ash says that tens of thousands of people use kratom not just to help with chronic pain, but also to alleviate depression and to provide relief from PTSD. She strongly disputes that users like herself are simply exchanging one addictive drug for another.\n\n\u201cI have never had a craving for kratom,\u201d Ash says. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare it to even the mildest opiate. It simply won\u2019t get you high.\u201d\n\nWhat it might do, users say, is slightly tweak your mood. The leaves of the Mitragyna speciosa tree, a biological relative of coffee, have been chewed for centuries in Southeast Asia by farmers to increase their stamina. Kratom is gently euphoric and also relaxing\u2014think coffee without the jitters and sleeplessness. It is hard to take toxic levels of the herb, since larger doses induce nausea and vomiting.\n\nBut does it provide medical benefits? Dr. Walter Prozialeck, chair of the Department of Pharmacology at Midwestern University in Downers Grove, Illinois, who conducted a survey of the scant medical literature on kratom, says the herb did indeed help to relieve pain in animal studies.\n\nWhile no clinical trials have yet been done with humans, addicts in Thailand and Malaysia have used kratom for decades to detox from heroin and alcohol. It was so successful in getting people off opium that Thailand banned kratom in 1943 to stem the loss of the opium taxes that funded the government.\n\nNobody knows how many are using kratom here in the US. \u201cThere are so many testimonials out there [from kratom users] on the Internet that I personally found quite compelling,\u201d Dr. Prozialeck says. \u201cThis merits further study.\u201d\n\nBut study has proven difficult. Dr. Edward Boyer, director of toxicology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, says that when he tried to conduct research on kratom, potential partners told him, \u201cwe don\u2019t fund drugs of abuse.\u201d Drug companies have shown sporadic interest in isolating the active constituents in kratom since the 1960s, he says, but no pharmaceuticals have yet been developed from them.\n\nGiven the current opioid crisis, Boyer hopes researchers will dive deeper into the plant\u2019s pharmacology. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great to have an analgesic that will relieve your pain and not kill you?\u201d Boyer notes that kratom is free from the potentially deadly side effects like respiratory failure that have bedeviled prescription opioids.\n\nHowever, drug companies have shown little interest in a plant remedy that cannot be patented. While some of kratom\u2019s active ingredients have indeed been patented by researchers who hope one day to market them to pharmaceutical firms, Boyer said that these compounds have failed to exhibit as powerful pain-killing effects as the whole plant. \u201cThere is something in there that we don\u2019t yet understand,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd if the DEA\u2019s ban goes into effect, we may never understand kratom\u2019s remarkable potential. That\u2019s because the federal action would have a chilling effect on research, according to Boyer.\n\nThe DEA claims that kratom is addictive. Since you can get hooked on most anything\u2014 even coffee or chocolate, as Dr. Boyer pointed out, this claim is both relatively meaningless and also hard to dispute. Users report that withdrawal symptoms from kratom are comparable to giving up coffee\u2014a few days of irritability, perhaps a headache.\n\nIn issuing its scheduling notice, the DEA said that the Centers for Disease Control received 660 complaints about kratom (including reports of constipation and vomiting) between 2010 to 2015, out of 3 million calls annually reporting adverse reactions to assorted other foods and drugs. To put this number in perspective, the National Poison Data System registers more than 3,700 calls about caffeine annually, every year leading to multiple overdoses that result in death.\n\n\u201cThis hardly constitutes a public health emergency,\u201d says Susan Ash. \u201cThey definitely get more calls about energy drinks.\u201d\n\nIn banning kratom, the DEA dispensed with the usual public comment period. Advocates, however, refuse to be silenced. They plan to challenge the DEA\u2019s action in court and are marching on the White House on September 13. A petition urging President Barack Obama to reverse the ban has surpassed the 100,000 signature mark which, by law, requires a personal response from the president.\n\n\u201cThere is a cheap plant out there that\u2019s helping people getting off opioids,\u201d Ash says, \u201cand now so many are going to be forced back into active addiction, or made a prey to black market drug dealers.\u201d\n\nWhat if, instead of turning tens of thousands of law-abiding Americans into either addicts or felons, the DEA listened to those who have used kratom successfully to kick their addictions and manage chronic pain? Instead of banning the herb, why not draft some sensible regulation to establish dosage and labelling requirements and to protect consumers from adulterated product?\n\nAnd while they are at it, America\u2019s drug agency should sponsor some long overdue scientific research into a substance that may be the best thing going to combat our runaway epidemic of opioid addiction.\n\nSource: https://www.wired.com/2016/09/dea-wrong-ban-cure-opioid-addiction/\n#news\n#story\n#drugs\n#addiction",

There is onl\u0443 thing you should pay attention to. If you come in the high season that is from the 15th of December to 15th of January you may have some problems when searching a house to stay. At this time the Island is full of people, everybody comes to celebrate the New Year, and that is why almost all the houses are occupied. So if you arrive around this time, I advise you to book in your accommodation in advance.

After that to choose a bike suiting you taste and in the color you need, you should come to every office and bargain. When renting you a bike Thais always take your passport. And if you leave even a tiny scratch on the bike, they will get really angry. They seem to have a national Thai sport \u2013 fooling a foreigner. So a friend of mine paid 3000 for a small scratch, Thais did not want to give him his passport back, and the ferry was already set to sail, so my friend had to pay.

I'll give you more details about it in the following articles. Another very important tip - if it\u2019s your first time on the island, download the map <a href=\"http://maps.me/\">Maps.me</a> and mark there all the important places. Because as soon as it gets dark on the island - everything is changing, and it\u2019s very easy to get lost. Thank you for reading my article. I hope it will be useful to you.

I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/14/pumpkin-with-jerked-beef/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](http://www.tudogostoso.com.br/receita/75748-carne-seca-com-abobora.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

I can tell you it's lots of fun mixed with a healthy dose of traditions. If you have a short attention span then feel free to watch the 5 minute video. I've put it at the top, it has groovy music and captures the essence of the day. \n\nFor those of you who would like to know more, then keep scrolling as I go into pain-staking detail of each of the sections of the wedding along with some pictures. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it, it was certainly a day I will never forget.\n\nLet me tell you I posted this story in the early days of steemit and I think about 6 people saw it. So I have edited it a bit and formatted it to look better. So, I hope you are OK with my re-post.

So first things first. We have to come to the house, and we can't just rock up and knock on the door and say &quot;Heh we are here for the wedding!&quot;. No, that wouldn't do. I must collect my rabbly entourage of family and friends and assorted village vagabonds and assemble them at a point a few hundred metres up the road. From here we must sing, dance and shout our impending arrival as we make our way up the street.</p>\n<p>The procession is lead by the groom\u2019s representative or (\u201c\u0e40\u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48) Thao Gae\u201d, in this case it was a professor from my wife's university. He was my guide, and helper as I had never done this before. I got the idea that it wasn't his first time at the rodeo. Also as a respected guest he was going to help me gain entry to the fortress that lay ahead. Joining us were my parents, relatives and friends carrying flowers, incenses, candles and gifts, all which were required for the ceremony.  Also at the front of the procession were drummers and traditional folk dancers, who making all the banging, clanging and swirling to announce our arrival to everybody in the surrounding village.</p>\n<p>Banana leaves and sugar cane storks were given to some of the stronger members to carry, while others had the responsibility of bringing the traditional gifts of the Kan Maak, which included rice, sesame seeds, some small amounts of  Thai food for the feast, a selection of Thai desserts. I'd been told sometimes a pigs head was involved, but thankfully not today. My brother and one of my wife's aunt were entrusted with the monetary gifts and other precious items, such as gold and jewellery, which would make up the dowry. A lot of these gifts represent important aspects of marriage, such as health, prosperity, fertility and longevity.</p>\n<h2><center>2. PASSING THROUGH THE GATES (\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e01\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e15\u0e39)</center></h2>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/11181948_10208457810145636_2445300566550295799_n001d7.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<h6><center>PASSING THROUGH THE GATES (\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e01\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e15\u0e39)</center></h6>\n<p>In order for the wedding to commence, I had to first collect my bride-to-be from her room inside the family house. Simple enough? Not really.....To do this I had to successfully navigate through a series of gates which only opened upon completion of certain challenges. These symbolic barriers would only be opened once I had proved my worth to the keepers of the \u201clocks\u201d.</p>\n<p>Normally, there are just 3 of these symbolic \u201cgates\u201d, but sometimes there may be more, and in my case there were. The gates were made up of strings of orchids, or chains of silver and gold, and each one was held by either close friends or young family members of the bride.  I think I sang, danced and bribed my way through 9 gates before I made it to the house mostly in one piece, Indiana Jones would have been proud.. thankfully, my &quot; Thao Gae&quot; (I mentioned him earlier) was a shrewd negotiator and also commanded a bit of respect.</p>\n<p>As I passed each challenge, the toll for each subsequent \u201cgate\u201d continually  increased as I advanced. I gave the first few gatekeepers 100 Baht ( about $3) to open the door. By the time I got to the last road-block I think her teenage cousins wrangled 1,000 Baht ($30 each) out of me, not bad for 5 minutes work...This wass undoubtedly one of the most frivolous and fun parts of the wedding as I bartered with the various gatekeepers to let me through.</p>\n<h2><center>3. MONKS BLESSING</center></h2>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12646972_10208457829026108_2159037764911094443_n18556.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<h6><center>Monks Blessing</center></h6>\n<p>Once the gates have been successfully negotiated, I was allowed to collect the bride from her room to continue the next part of ceremony which was the monks blessing. We had 9 monks (auspicious number) and they chanted their way through a succession of blessings whilst a lit candle was placed in a bowl of water. This water was then used later to bless us. A bowl of white paste was also blessed which was also used later to anoint our foreheads, you may notice the white dots on our faces.</p>\n<p>Although more solemn than the previous shenanigans on the way in, I still enjoyed this moment very much. The eldest monk has known my wife since the day she was born and watched her grow into the woman she is today.</p>\n<p>After the chanting had finished, we offered food to the monks. Nobody else wass permitted to eat until the monks had finished their meal.  After they had eaten, they took no further part in the ceremony, and after a brief chat, they trundled up the road back to the temple.</p>\n<h2><center>4. COUNTING THE DOWRY (\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e14)</center></h2>\n<p><center><a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/RovDB\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/1936966_10208457857546821_8495313954892798009_n73db8.jpg\" /></a></center><br />\n<center><a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/RoTmi\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12647460_10208457863426968_3192397085304096848_na6906.jpg\" /></a><center></p>\n<h6><center>Counting The Dowry</center></h6>\n<p>Next is the dowry ceremony. This is the part which is often difficult for foreigners to comprehend. I admit, for me, it goes against most of what I believe marriage to be about, however, it is an important part of the  traditional ceremony, so we compromise in marriage, and I compromised. The dowry is a symbol that the groom is financially able to care for his new wife.The concept of sinsod was initially brought in to ensure that one\u2019s daughter did not marry below her potential standing in life. To stipulate that her social, financial and professional status and reputation is preserved and secured. Although this is less relevant nowadays, the tradition remains.</p>\n<p>So my dowry was formally presented by my parents to my bride\u2019s mum on the Kan Maak tray. This particular dowry consisted of some money, gold,  and jewellery, but may also include title deeds to property in some cases. The dowry was then counted out onto a red cloth by my bride\u2019s mum. She put on a bit of a pantomime that it was too heavy to pick up. The amount of the dowry had been predetermined, (Please don't ask how much).<br />\n<center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://images.freeimages.com/images/premium/large-thumbs/1759/17595965-headache.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p>There is no set amount, the sum of sinsod is typically determined on the one hand by suitor\u2019s perceived wealth, and on the other hand by the \u201cvalue\u201d of the future wife. Her beauty, personality, background, education and other qualifications.More often than not, a part of the money is used to pay for the wedding ceremonies, parties and other related expenses. Dowries or sinsod payments range from THB 50,000 to 500,000 ($1500-$1500) and up.</p>\n<h2><center>5. THE ENGAGEMENT (\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19)</center></h2>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12705258_805141222931506_4453740646358700893_n06042.jpg\" /></center><br />\n<center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12642771_10154007838824367_2870077142764225994_nd3d88.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<h6><center>The Engagement</center></h6>\n<p>Traditionally, the engagement is performed well in advance of the wedding, just as in western culture, but recently, it has become common for it to be carried out on the wedding day after Counting the Dowry. I mean, we got engaged about 6 months earlier, but we rolled the ceremonial aspect of this into the wedding. The engagement was a way of introducing the bride to the groom, who had been selected by her parents and gave a chance for the couple to get acquainted before the wedding, but nowadays most couples choose their own partners, as we obviously did ;)</p>\n<p>At this point, we exchanged rings, and I also took the jewellery  from Sin Sod tray and placed them on my bride as well. The exchange is performed in front of the parents of both parties.</p>\n<h2><center>6.

Traditionally, this was all that was required to validate the marriage, but nowadays the couple are also required to obtain a marriage certificate (\u0e17\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e23\u0e2a) from the local registration office (Shh. we haven't done that yet).</p>\n<p>Before the water pouring took place, we  must seat ourselves at the traditional water pouring tables (\u0e15\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e23\u0e14\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33 [Dtang Rot Naam]), with the bride to the left of the groom. We each had a ceremonial headdress (\u0e21\u0e07\u0e04\u0e25 [Mong Kol]) , made from one piece of cotton forming a circle and signifying the joining of us as a couple, placed upon our heads. The Mong Kol had been previously been blessed by the Buddhist monks earlier in the wedding.</p>\n<p>Then senior members of the family or special guests of honor performed the anointing of our foreheads with three dots of white powder to represent the shape of a pyramid. Traditionally, the powder is made of dirt or clay, ground, and mixed with holy water and blessed by Buddhist monks. As with all of the ceremony\u2019s traditional customs, the ritual is meant to bring good fortune to the couple. (more dots)</p>\n<p>We were ready for the water pouring to commence once we had placed both hands (palms together), overhanging the water pouring table and positioned above flowers that were arranged in a water tray, to capture the water that ran off. Each of the elder guests in turn will take the ceremonial water pouring conch shell (\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e07\u0e02\u0e4c\u0e23\u0e14\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33), which had been freshly filled with holy water from the Buddhist ceremony, and poured a trickle of water from the base of our thumbs to the fingertips over the groom and then the bride. Most also used this opportunity to give us their congratulations and best wishes.</p>\n<h2><center>7. THE BRIDAL BED (\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e07\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27)</center></h2>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/5613072010035547817e4.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<h6><center>The Bridal Bed</center></h6>\n<p>After the water pouring ceremony was completed, we were sent to their bedroom. This is where things got a little weird. This is just a part of the wedding ceremony, we were not going to bed for real just yet. : ) although by this stage I was getting exhausted and could have used a little nap.</p>\n<p>The bed will was prepared by  a married couple who had been happily married for a long time, in this case my mum and dad. Their knowledge and good luck was then imparted to us in a number of different ways. Nine meaningful items were placed on the bed  as symbols of prosperity and fertility. They didn't really know what to do either do we kind of ad-libbed this a bit. But the goods on the bed were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One big brass tray (\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e19\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48)</li>\n<li>A mortar as a symbol of steadily love (\u0e04\u0e23\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e22\u0e32 \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 \u0e08\u0e34\u0e15\u0e43\u0e08\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e41\u0e19\u0e48\u0e19)</li>\n<li>A cane as a symbol of long life (\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49\u0e40\u0e17\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e22\u0e38\u0e22\u0e37\u0e19)</li>\n<li>A green squash as a symbol of happy and peaceful married life (\u0e1f\u0e31\u0e01\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 \u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e40\u0e22\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02)</li>\n<li>A silver bag and gold bag of beans, sesame seeds and baking powder(\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e08\u0e23\u0e34\u0e0d\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e07\u0e32\u0e21\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1f\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1f\u0e39)</li>\n<li>A bowl of rain water as a symbol of harmony (\u0e02\u0e31\u0e19\u0e43\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e1d\u0e19 \u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e31\u0e04\u0e04\u0e35 \u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e43\u0e08\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19)</li>\n<li>A white cat doll as a symbol of liking to stay at home (\u0e15\u0e38\u0e4a\u0e01\u0e15\u0e32\u0e41\u0e21\u0e27\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e02\u0e32\u0e27 \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 \u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19)</li>\n<li>A white chicken as a symbol of early rising  (\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48\u0e02\u0e32\u0e27 \u0e15\u0e37\u0e48\u0e19\u0e14\u0e36\u0e01 \u0e25\u0e38\u0e01\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e32)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tradition states that we the newly-weds must sleep with these objects in the bed for the next 3 nights.

Most do both in the same day with the traditional Thai ceremony in the morning followed by the party in the afternoon or evening. Some couples prefer to do them on a separate day. We did ours on the same day. We got a brief 30 minute respite in which to update our Facebook status (lol) and do a Superman costume change into the afternoon's attire.</p>\n<p>We held the party in an empty field next to the house, which suited me fine, as I'm not a fan of dingy hotel ballrooms. The torrential rain from the night before held off, and apart from a bit of mud underfoot, all was well.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12592469_10208458697167811_570179526128667858_n07e5f.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p>A Thai wedding party is usually large (aka huge). We probably only had about 50 people for the ceremony in the morning but we catered for 800 for the party....Yes 800... Parents will invite almost every single person they know; family members, relatives, colleagues, neighbors and of course it includes the immediate family of those guests. The more people the parents and the couple know, the bigger the wedding. It appears my wife's family knew everyone in the surrounding village even if my wife didn't have a clue who half of them were.</p>\n<p>This is due to the Thai custom about \u2018face\u2019 \u2013 especially if the family has important status in the society. If you don\u2019t invite someone, they will feel insulted and you could lose the relationship with them. Often the wedding of the children is like a reunion party for the parents. For us, it involved lots and lots of picture taking followed by more picture taking.  There was some food in there somewhere, along with a band and some more traditional dancers.<br />\n<center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12647520_10208458164834503_7645634436442074275_n6a48d.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p>Thai people don\u2019t usually give wedding gifts, instead they give cash. When the guest receives the wedding invitation, they will use the envelope of the invitation card to put the cash in. Then when they arrive at the wedding party\u2019s reception, there will be money boxes for the guests to put the cash envelope in. You can also write wishes for the wedding couple in a guest-book prepared at the reception and receive a wedding souvenir.</p>\n<h1><center>Lighting the candles &amp; Cutting the Cake</center></h1>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12647146_10204110386320266_7030143074989390932_n17dcb.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p>Before cutting the cake, the wedding couple will light up three auspicious candles (\u0e40\u0e17\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e21\u0e07\u0e04\u0e25 ).<br />\nAfter that the cake was cut and we served it to out parents and closest relatives first. Pretty sure that big cake was just for show, and we had a smaller one for devouring.</p>\n<h1><center>Eat, Drink and be Merry</center></h1>\n<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent eating, drinking and chatting with the guests who remained. It's quite common for many of the guests to vanish quite quickly, as people get back to work or other activities. Regardless, a group of us stayed on till late in the evening recounting tales of times past.</p>\n<p>When the party was finished, we had to count the money they received and also make a note of the amount of the money they receive from each guest, so when they are invited to the guest\u2019s wedding or the wedding of the guest\u2019s child, they should put more money in the envelope.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12650955_10208458277437318_4345598323686671232_n7c3a9.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<h3><center>Stay tuned for Pt.2</center></h3>\n<p>Part 2: The Thai Beach Wedding, where we have a Western Ceremony by the beach.

Mix the mayonnaise with pickles, olives and finely chopped egg\n\n### 2. Season with olive oil and Worcestershire sauce to taste\n\n### 3. If you want more sophisticated add some white raisins, seeded, chopped\n\n### 4. Place a little of the filling carefully over the slices of ham and wrap them\n\n### 5. Serve on lettuce leaves chopped\n\n### 6. It\u2019s a great cold starter and very decorative\n\n### 7. If you wish to serve as canap\u00e9s, just cut each roll in half and secure with a silver toothpick\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://gustavopasquini.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2-1.png\n\n# About Me\n\n### In 2012 I began my cooking journey in Brasil and studied at \u201cSenac, Juiz de Fora\u201d, in Minas Gerais, developing my basic culinary techniques.\n\n### Later I worked in a local restaurant, and rose to a role in management, helping to increase the clientele base. I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/14/rolls-of-ham-and-mayonnaise/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](http://www.tudogostoso.com.br/receita/46066-rolinhos-de-presunto-e-maionese.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "body": "About two years ago now, my wife Sabrina and I were feeling a little ill, we had been bitten by the travel bug, but couldn't get away. We were stuck in Vancouver Canada, with just about enough money to pay the bills, but not much to do anything else. One thing we really truly love is traveling and exploring places we have never been, but this particular year it was really looking like a trip was just not going to happen. We didn't have the cash, things weren't working out the way we thought they needed to, we resigned to just stay home.\n\nThen out of nowhere, in the span of about a week, we ended up booking 2 jobs that we weren't expecting. Suddenly we had a fist full of cash (actually, a bank account balance slightly higher than normal) and since we had been planning on tightening up the belt as it were, this cash was basically bonus. I got to thinking about it for a day or two, then one afternoon I just turned to Sabrina and said \"Hey, so we've got this money now, do you want to go to China?\" \n\nWe both kinda laughed for a minute, then she said \"Yeah, I really do... do you think we can?\" \n\nTwo days later we had flights booked to Beijing, and 3 nights reserved at a hostel in the city, the rest was up to us to figure out as it came along. We look back at this insane, spontaneous decision with fond memories and warm laughter every time we talk about it. It was the start of one of the best trips we have ever been on together, and we don't regret a single thing. Even when one of our jobs cancelled late, and the person who was going to rent our place canned out last minute (double rent, yay!!), and we ended up running out of money about three quarters of the way into our trip (hi uh mom? yeah, so were in Cambodia, and well, you're not gonna believe this...). \n\nI'll be making more posts as a series eventually covering our entire trip through Asia, but for now I hope you enjoy looking through some of our memories from China!\n\n## Around Beijing\n\n###### Sabrina, on our way to Vancouver airport.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer1f0cd4.jpg\n\n###### On the tarmac at Shanghai, about to board our connecting flight to Beijing.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer68f8570.jpg\n\n###### Sabrina was getting a little tired.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer6370e2b.jpg\n\n###### On the way to Beijing!!\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer3e45da.jpg\n\n###### One of the first images I took in Beijing.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer400960.jpg\n\n###### The alley way leading to our hostel, you can see the sign in the back \"Sunrise Hostel\" \nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer37b44ef.jpg\n\n###### Severe jetlag = waking up at 4:00 in the morning to explore Beijing.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer38c6101.jpg\n\n###### Later on that morning we were able to taste one of the worst simulated coffee flavored beverages ever to disgrace the face of this earth.

I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/13/puff-pastry-of-chocolate-and-strawberr/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](http://gshow.globo.com/receitas-gshow/receita/folhado-de-chocolate-e-morango-4ee3599be1608c68880013cf.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/13/bean-turned/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](https://www.comidaereceitas.com.br/legumes-e-verduras/virado-de-feijao.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465",

    "body": "For all in  Steemit!\n\n\nThe melting of the Arctic ice cap due to global warming increasingly alarming. Each year , the sea level rise of 1-3 mm . If not immediately anticipated , rising sea levels is certainly dangerous for the survival of human beings living on the earth surface . Even more dangerous , several major cities in the world was threatened with sinking due to rising sea levels , the foundation is fragile, as well as ground water extraction . The following eight major cities in the world are threatened with drowning.\n\nShanghai,china\n<center>\n<img style=\"border:0px; width:250px; height:120px;\" src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/d9i0vjmzd/405046_queensland_039_s_flood_disaster.jpg\"/>\n</center>\nShanghai was once just a place surrounded by swamp . The need for a place to stay and a population that swells create more and more skyscrapers in the area. Not surprisingly , each year the ground in Shanghai dropped half an inch . Based on data from PBS , the surface of the ground in Shanghai fell by around 2.4 meters within the period 1921 to 1965. Experts estimate that the land in Shanghai no longer able to withstand the heavy loads of building on it . Predicted a time Shanghai will sink if the Yangze River overflowed\n\n\n\nSaigon,Vietnam\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/s97fe437x/Saigon_Flooding.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n\nOne of the most populous cities in Southeast Asia is also in danger of drowning. The reduced surface soil make this area prone to flooding . Each year, the floodwaters rose as high as 2cm.\n\n\nBangkok,Thailand\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/dq72f2v8b/temples_flooded_in_thailand_data.jpg\"/>\n</center>\nHead of the National Disaster Warning Centre of Thailand , Smith Dharmasaroja , predicted in 2100 Bangkok will be the second Atlantis . The city will sink due to several factors , such as : climate change due to greenhouse effect , rising sea levels , coastal erosion , and landslides . Plus it lies low causing Bangkok every year has flooded.\n\nMumbai,india\n\n\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/fgl6hs59n/28sl3.jpg\"/>\n</center>\nNot much different from Bangkok , a group of Greenpeace activists in 2100 memperkitakan Mumbai city will be submerged by seawater . Rising sea levels of up to 5 meters led to the city's community in the town threatened its sustainability.\nMexico,City\n\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/ml22odc4z/f8fcd814_1646_4aaa_ad1e_b4bc111c707c_650x366.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n\nThis one city each year sunk 20cm in case of flooding . It lies in the valley plus the poor drainage system make Mexico City in danger of drowning. Since 1975 , the city's drainage capacity is down 30 percent . But now the government is pushing for the manufacture of drainage tunnel giant who claimed can hold enough water.\n\n\nNew York\n\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/6g8rm99zx/Yellow_cabs_line_a_flood_010.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n\nRising sea levels threaten the city turned out to take part in these United States. Position at the mouth of the Hudson River that connects directly to the Atlantic Ocean helped trigger. Science Daily predict , the city sea water more than doubled compared to other oceans . Not only that , coastal erosion , decreased soil and destruction of the environment can also trigger the overflow of water in the city known as the center of the business world.\n\n\nVenesia,italy\n\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/rzrojow7p/628x471.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n\nThe end of 2012 , the city was flooded badly . This phenomenon is present due to a combination of heavy rain and wind from the south . At least 70 percent of the land in the canal city is flooded with a depth of up to 1.5 meters above normal . Flooding was apparently one of the indications that the region of Venice continues to sink . Christian Science Monitor even noted , the city dropped its surface as long as 30 cm over the last 100 years. The rising water level in the Mediterranean Sea canal city likely add it to sink.\n\n\nJakarta,indonesia\n\n\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/3m6tky4kr/335370_jakarta_floods.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n\n\nIn addition to the geographical location of which is under sea level , the need for a high water is considered to be one of the causes of the sinking of the mainland Jakarta . Population continues to increase the main reason for the need for groundwater . In a period of 20 years, the estimated number of residents in the capital increase of up to 40 million people.\n\n\nHydrology expert from the Netherlands , Janjaap Brinkman explained that if the soil water suction process continuously carried out , at the end of the 21st century , Jakarta will sink five to six meters deep . A matter of time Jakarta will sink beneath the sea as the city of Atlantis\n\nThese towns are threatened sinking due to rising sea levels and global warming . If we do not change the way we treat the earth , these cities will be completely submerged without we could do anything. Let's start caring for the environment.!!!\n\n\n\n\nComments and Responses You\nVery I would expect to progress I\nAnd I hope you enjoyed reading this post\n\n\nDon't forget to vote and follow me,\nThanks...\n\n\nBest Regars\n\nhttps://s9.postimg.org/7que1vu0v/20150608150705.jpg\n\nSazkia@Siniceku",

Before any procedure, dessalgue their dried meat, which usually comes to us consumers with too much salt to your saves. Cut the meat into large cubes of edge 5cm +/- each. Dip these cubes of dried meat in a container with water to the surface of the meat, covering the cubes. Keep this container in the refrigerator and replace your water every 2 hours, 3 to 4 times depending on how their meat is salty.\n\n### 2. To find out if your meat is too much or too little salt, just testing the water at the last and penultimate exchanges; if it is too salty, require more exchanges of cold water, if the water is only brackish, will be ready the meat to be manipulated.\n\n### 3. In a pressure cooker and over medium heat, saute onion and garlic in olive oil, leaving them brown. Add to this mixture the meat without water dessalgue, in order to seal (browning meat outside), while stirring occasionally.\n\n### 4. Add the wine, water and cover the pressure cooker, sealing it well. Lower the heat to the lowest setting and cook in pressure for about 30 minutes.\n\n### 5. Turn off the heat, allow the pressure out completely. Open the pot and see if the meat is well tender, otherwise return it to the fire, with the covered pot for a few minutes (10minutes, depending on how the meat in question is still hard).\n\n### 6. Once cooked meat and tender, remove all the liquid that came off the meat into another container and set aside.\n\n### 7. Close the pressure cooker with the meat cooked inside, and shake several times and vigorously. When you open the pressure cooker meat should be shredded completely. If not, close the pot again and repeat the procedure until the desired result.\n\n### 8. Transfer the meat with its broth to a small saucepan and deep, add pelati tomatoes, mix well, correct the salt if necessary, and leave on medium heat until the broth begins to reduce and refine. About 20 minutes. The more reduce broth, the flavor will be determined.\n\n\n\n## Polenta\n\n### Boil water in a deep pan and add low-temperature salt and fine corn flour gradually, stirring until it is full-bodied and creamy. Preferably, follow the \"proportion\" of water and cornmeal, and the \"method of preparation\" of the flour manufacturer to polenta to buy, after all there are differences in the composition of each of these industrialized corn mixtures! Porcione container or format you want to serve.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://gustavopasquini.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2-1.png\n\n# About Me\n\n### In 2012 I began my cooking journey in Brasil and studied at \u201cSenac, Juiz de Fora\u201d, in Minas Gerais, developing my basic culinary techniques.\n\n### Later I worked in a local restaurant, and rose to a role in management, helping to increase the clientele base.

    "body": "https://i.imgur.com/kkQjc0k.jpg\n\nWith Heroin addiction and death at its highest rates ever.. Why would the DEA ban an all natural plant that helps people who get off of Heroin? I had to SHARE this article because of hour bogus our fucked up country is.\n\n45 years AFTER the drug war was declared by President Richard Nixon, the United States leads the world in both recreational drug usage and incarceration rates. Heroin abuse rates continue to soar. Drug-related violence in our nation\u2019s cities and cartel wars in Latin America exact horrific tolls.\n\nAnd then there is the ever-present bully on the block, prescription drug abuse. More than two million Americans have become hooked on the pharmaceuticals that doctors prescribe to ease their pain. Opioids\u2014both legal and illicit\u2014killed a mind-boggling 28,647 people in 2014.\n\nBut not to worry: The Drug Enforcement Administration is on the case. \u201cTo avoid an imminent hazard to public safety,\u201d the agency said in a press release, it will be adding kratom, a medicinal herb that has been used safely in Southeast Asia for centuries, to its list of Schedule 1 substances, placing the popular botanical in a class with killers like heroin and cocaine at the end of September.\n\nWhy ban the mild-mannered tree leaf? Well, because the DEA claims it\u2019s an opioid with \u201cno currently accepted medical use.\u201d Wrong on both counts. Pharmacologists label kratom as an alkaloid, not an opioid. True, kratom stimulates certain opioid receptors in the brain. But then, so does drinking a glass of wine, or running a marathon.\n\nKratom is less habit-forming than classic opioids like heroin and the pharmaceutical oxycodone, and its impact on the brain is weaker and more selective. Nevertheless, the herb\u2019s ability to bind loosely with certain opioid receptors makes it a godsend for addicts who want to kick their habits. Kratom is currently helping wean thousands of Americans off illegal drugs and prescription pain relievers, without creating any dangerous long term dependency.\n\nThe powdered leaves are readily available from scores of herb sellers on the Internet. Since the ban was announced in late August, websites and social media have exploded with accounts from people who credit the plant with saving them from lives of addiction and chronic pain.\n\nTake, for example, Virginia native Susan Ash. She was using Suboxone to help cope with severe joint pain resulting from Lyme disease. \u201cMy life was ruled by the clock\u2014all I could think was, \u2018when do I take my next dose,'\u201d Ash says. Then someone suggested she try kratom to help kick her addiction to the prescription pain killer. \u201cIn two weeks time, I went from being a bed-bound invalid to a productive member of society again.\n\nShe founded the American Kratom Society in 2014 to help keep this herbal lifeline legal. Ash says that tens of thousands of people use kratom not just to help with chronic pain, but also to alleviate depression and to provide relief from PTSD. She strongly disputes that users like herself are simply exchanging one addictive drug for another.\n\n\u201cI have never had a craving for kratom,\u201d Ash says. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare it to even the mildest opiate. It simply won\u2019t get you high.\u201d\n\nWhat it might do, users say, is slightly tweak your mood. The leaves of the Mitragyna speciosa tree, a biological relative of coffee, have been chewed for centuries in Southeast Asia by farmers to increase their stamina. Kratom is gently euphoric and also relaxing\u2014think coffee without the jitters and sleeplessness. It is hard to take toxic levels of the herb, since larger doses induce nausea and vomiting.\n\nBut does it provide medical benefits? Dr. Walter Prozialeck, chair of the Department of Pharmacology at Midwestern University in Downers Grove, Illinois, who conducted a survey of the scant medical literature on kratom, says the herb did indeed help to relieve pain in animal studies.\n\nWhile no clinical trials have yet been done with humans, addicts in Thailand and Malaysia have used kratom for decades to detox from heroin and alcohol. It was so successful in getting people off opium that Thailand banned kratom in 1943 to stem the loss of the opium taxes that funded the government.\n\nNobody knows how many are using kratom here in the US. \u201cThere are so many testimonials out there [from kratom users] on the Internet that I personally found quite compelling,\u201d Dr. Prozialeck says. \u201cThis merits further study.\u201d\n\nBut study has proven difficult. Dr. Edward Boyer, director of toxicology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, says that when he tried to conduct research on kratom, potential partners told him, \u201cwe don\u2019t fund drugs of abuse.\u201d Drug companies have shown sporadic interest in isolating the active constituents in kratom since the 1960s, he says, but no pharmaceuticals have yet been developed from them.\n\nGiven the current opioid crisis, Boyer hopes researchers will dive deeper into the plant\u2019s pharmacology. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great to have an analgesic that will relieve your pain and not kill you?\u201d Boyer notes that kratom is free from the potentially deadly side effects like respiratory failure that have bedeviled prescription opioids.\n\nHowever, drug companies have shown little interest in a plant remedy that cannot be patented. While some of kratom\u2019s active ingredients have indeed been patented by researchers who hope one day to market them to pharmaceutical firms, Boyer said that these compounds have failed to exhibit as powerful pain-killing effects as the whole plant. \u201cThere is something in there that we don\u2019t yet understand,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd if the DEA\u2019s ban goes into effect, we may never understand kratom\u2019s remarkable potential. That\u2019s because the federal action would have a chilling effect on research, according to Boyer.\n\nThe DEA claims that kratom is addictive. Since you can get hooked on most anything\u2014 even coffee or chocolate, as Dr. Boyer pointed out, this claim is both relatively meaningless and also hard to dispute. Users report that withdrawal symptoms from kratom are comparable to giving up coffee\u2014a few days of irritability, perhaps a headache.\n\nIn issuing its scheduling notice, the DEA said that the Centers for Disease Control received 660 complaints about kratom (including reports of constipation and vomiting) between 2010 to 2015, out of 3 million calls annually reporting adverse reactions to assorted other foods and drugs. To put this number in perspective, the National Poison Data System registers more than 3,700 calls about caffeine annually, every year leading to multiple overdoses that result in death.\n\n\u201cThis hardly constitutes a public health emergency,\u201d says Susan Ash. \u201cThey definitely get more calls about energy drinks.\u201d\n\nIn banning kratom, the DEA dispensed with the usual public comment period. Advocates, however, refuse to be silenced. They plan to challenge the DEA\u2019s action in court and are marching on the White House on September 13. A petition urging President Barack Obama to reverse the ban has surpassed the 100,000 signature mark which, by law, requires a personal response from the president.\n\n\u201cThere is a cheap plant out there that\u2019s helping people getting off opioids,\u201d Ash says, \u201cand now so many are going to be forced back into active addiction, or made a prey to black market drug dealers.\u201d\n\nWhat if, instead of turning tens of thousands of law-abiding Americans into either addicts or felons, the DEA listened to those who have used kratom successfully to kick their addictions and manage chronic pain? Instead of banning the herb, why not draft some sensible regulation to establish dosage and labelling requirements and to protect consumers from adulterated product?\n\nAnd while they are at it, America\u2019s drug agency should sponsor some long overdue scientific research into a substance that may be the best thing going to combat our runaway epidemic of opioid addiction.\n\nSource: https://www.wired.com/2016/09/dea-wrong-ban-cure-opioid-addiction/\n#news\n#story\n#drugs\n#addiction",

There is onl\u0443 thing you should pay attention to. If you come in the high season that is from the 15th of December to 15th of January you may have some problems when searching a house to stay. At this time the Island is full of people, everybody comes to celebrate the New Year, and that is why almost all the houses are occupied. So if you arrive around this time, I advise you to book in your accommodation in advance. Here you can see some reliable <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/arkady.volk?fref=ts\">Realtors</a>, who will not trick you and do everything very quickly and nicely. &nbsp;But if you do not plan to come in the high season, you can easily find a suitable accommodation for yourself. As soon as you step out to the dock you get immediately surrounded by a bunch of taxi drivers who want to take you somewhere. It\u2019s better not to use their services, and do everything on your own. &nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\u0412 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 - \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c 2 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f. \u0417\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u044e\u0430\u043d\u0441 - \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0438\u043a \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430 - \u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441 15 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0431\u0440\u044f \u043f\u043e 15 \u044f\u043d\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 - \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0437\u0436\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044b. \u041f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f - \u0442\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435. \u0412\u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0438\u044d\u043b\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0442 \u0438 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e \u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e.&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>&nbsp;\u041d\u043e \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d \u0442\u043e \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043b\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0412\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0442\u0438. \u042f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u044e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0445 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0430 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043c.&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Your 1st task is to rent a bike by yourself.

After that to choose a bike suiting you taste and in the color you need, you should come to every office and bargain. When renting you a bike Thais always take your passport. And if you leave even a tiny scratch on the bike, they will get really angry. They seem to have a national Thai sport \u2013 fooling a foreigner. So a friend of mine paid 3000 for a small scratch, Thais did not want to give him his passport back, and the ferry was already set to sail, so my friend had to pay. Do not forget that you are a guest here and locals dictate the rules of the game here. That's their business. So be careful with a rented bike and protect it as your own.

See you soon!&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u044b \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435, \u043e\u0442\u0434\u043e\u0445\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0438 - \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0441\u044a\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435 - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0444\u0443\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0442. \u0417\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u043e \u043d\u0435\u043c \u044f \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443 \u0432 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f\u0445. \u0415\u0449\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435 - \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0443 maps me \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435. \u041f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0435\u0442 - \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u044e \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044e. \u042f \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d. \u0414\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0438!</blockquote>\n</html>\n\n<br />\n\n---\n\nIf you like this article not follow only me, but also follow the author - @maximkichev\n\n---\n\nAll STEEM Dollars for this post go to the featured author. \u0412\u0441\u0435 SD \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440.",

I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/14/pumpkin-with-jerked-beef/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](http://www.tudogostoso.com.br/receita/75748-carne-seca-com-abobora.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

I can tell you it's lots of fun mixed with a healthy dose of traditions. If you have a short attention span then feel free to watch the 5 minute video. I've put it at the top, it has groovy music and captures the essence of the day. \n\nFor those of you who would like to know more, then keep scrolling as I go into pain-staking detail of each of the sections of the wedding along with some pictures. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it, it was certainly a day I will never forget.\n\nLet me tell you I posted this story in the early days of steemit and I think about 6 people saw it. So I have edited it a bit and formatted it to look better. So, I hope you are OK with my re-post.

So first things first. We have to come to the house, and we can't just rock up and knock on the door and say &quot;Heh we are here for the wedding!&quot;. No, that wouldn't do. I must collect my rabbly entourage of family and friends and assorted village vagabonds and assemble them at a point a few hundred metres up the road. From here we must sing, dance and shout our impending arrival as we make our way up the street.</p>\n<p>The procession is lead by the groom\u2019s representative or (\u201c\u0e40\u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48) Thao Gae\u201d, in this case it was a professor from my wife's university. He was my guide, and helper as I had never done this before. I got the idea that it wasn't his first time at the rodeo. Also as a respected guest he was going to help me gain entry to the fortress that lay ahead. Joining us were my parents, relatives and friends carrying flowers, incenses, candles and gifts, all which were required for the ceremony.  Also at the front of the procession were drummers and traditional folk dancers, who making all the banging, clanging and swirling to announce our arrival to everybody in the surrounding village.</p>\n<p>Banana leaves and sugar cane storks were given to some of the stronger members to carry, while others had the responsibility of bringing the traditional gifts of the Kan Maak, which included rice, sesame seeds, some small amounts of  Thai food for the feast, a selection of Thai desserts. I'd been told sometimes a pigs head was involved, but thankfully not today. My brother and one of my wife's aunt were entrusted with the monetary gifts and other precious items, such as gold and jewellery, which would make up the dowry. A lot of these gifts represent important aspects of marriage, such as health, prosperity, fertility and longevity.</p>\n<h2><center>2. PASSING THROUGH THE GATES (\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e01\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e15\u0e39)</center></h2>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/11181948_10208457810145636_2445300566550295799_n001d7.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<h6><center>PASSING THROUGH THE GATES (\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e01\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e15\u0e39)</center></h6>\n<p>In order for the wedding to commence, I had to first collect my bride-to-be from her room inside the family house. Simple enough? Not really.....To do this I had to successfully navigate through a series of gates which only opened upon completion of certain challenges. These symbolic barriers would only be opened once I had proved my worth to the keepers of the \u201clocks\u201d.</p>\n<p>Normally, there are just 3 of these symbolic \u201cgates\u201d, but sometimes there may be more, and in my case there were. The gates were made up of strings of orchids, or chains of silver and gold, and each one was held by either close friends or young family members of the bride.  I think I sang, danced and bribed my way through 9 gates before I made it to the house mostly in one piece, Indiana Jones would have been proud.. thankfully, my &quot; Thao Gae&quot; (I mentioned him earlier) was a shrewd negotiator and also commanded a bit of respect.</p>\n<p>As I passed each challenge, the toll for each subsequent \u201cgate\u201d continually  increased as I advanced. I gave the first few gatekeepers 100 Baht ( about $3) to open the door. By the time I got to the last road-block I think her teenage cousins wrangled 1,000 Baht ($30 each) out of me, not bad for 5 minutes work...This wass undoubtedly one of the most frivolous and fun parts of the wedding as I bartered with the various gatekeepers to let me through.</p>\n<h2><center>3. MONKS BLESSING</center></h2>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12646972_10208457829026108_2159037764911094443_n18556.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<h6><center>Monks Blessing</center></h6>\n<p>Once the gates have been successfully negotiated, I was allowed to collect the bride from her room to continue the next part of ceremony which was the monks blessing. We had 9 monks (auspicious number) and they chanted their way through a succession of blessings whilst a lit candle was placed in a bowl of water. This water was then used later to bless us. A bowl of white paste was also blessed which was also used later to anoint our foreheads, you may notice the white dots on our faces.</p>\n<p>Although more solemn than the previous shenanigans on the way in, I still enjoyed this moment very much. The eldest monk has known my wife since the day she was born and watched her grow into the woman she is today.</p>\n<p>After the chanting had finished, we offered food to the monks. Nobody else wass permitted to eat until the monks had finished their meal.  After they had eaten, they took no further part in the ceremony, and after a brief chat, they trundled up the road back to the temple.</p>\n<h2><center>4. COUNTING THE DOWRY (\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e14)</center></h2>\n<p><center><a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/RovDB\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/1936966_10208457857546821_8495313954892798009_n73db8.jpg\" /></a></center><br />\n<center><a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/RoTmi\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12647460_10208457863426968_3192397085304096848_na6906.jpg\" /></a><center></p>\n<h6><center>Counting The Dowry</center></h6>\n<p>Next is the dowry ceremony. This is the part which is often difficult for foreigners to comprehend. I admit, for me, it goes against most of what I believe marriage to be about, however, it is an important part of the  traditional ceremony, so we compromise in marriage, and I compromised. The dowry is a symbol that the groom is financially able to care for his new wife.The concept of sinsod was initially brought in to ensure that one\u2019s daughter did not marry below her potential standing in life. To stipulate that her social, financial and professional status and reputation is preserved and secured. Although this is less relevant nowadays, the tradition remains.</p>\n<p>So my dowry was formally presented by my parents to my bride\u2019s mum on the Kan Maak tray. This particular dowry consisted of some money, gold,  and jewellery, but may also include title deeds to property in some cases. The dowry was then counted out onto a red cloth by my bride\u2019s mum. She put on a bit of a pantomime that it was too heavy to pick up. The amount of the dowry had been predetermined, (Please don't ask how much).<br />\n<center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://images.freeimages.com/images/premium/large-thumbs/1759/17595965-headache.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p>There is no set amount, the sum of sinsod is typically determined on the one hand by suitor\u2019s perceived wealth, and on the other hand by the \u201cvalue\u201d of the future wife. Her beauty, personality, background, education and other qualifications.More often than not, a part of the money is used to pay for the wedding ceremonies, parties and other related expenses. Dowries or sinsod payments range from THB 50,000 to 500,000 ($1500-$1500) and up.</p>\n<h2><center>5.

I mean, we got engaged about 6 months earlier, but we rolled the ceremonial aspect of this into the wedding. The engagement was a way of introducing the bride to the groom, who had been selected by her parents and gave a chance for the couple to get acquainted before the wedding, but nowadays most couples choose their own partners, as we obviously did ;)</p>\n<p>At this point, we exchanged rings, and I also took the jewellery  from Sin Sod tray and placed them on my bride as well. The exchange is performed in front of the parents of both parties.</p>\n<h2><center>6.

Traditionally, this was all that was required to validate the marriage, but nowadays the couple are also required to obtain a marriage certificate (\u0e17\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e23\u0e2a) from the local registration office (Shh. we haven't done that yet).</p>\n<p>Before the water pouring took place, we  must seat ourselves at the traditional water pouring tables (\u0e15\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e23\u0e14\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33 [Dtang Rot Naam]), with the bride to the left of the groom. We each had a ceremonial headdress (\u0e21\u0e07\u0e04\u0e25 [Mong Kol]) , made from one piece of cotton forming a circle and signifying the joining of us as a couple, placed upon our heads. The Mong Kol had been previously been blessed by the Buddhist monks earlier in the wedding.</p>\n<p>Then senior members of the family or special guests of honor performed the anointing of our foreheads with three dots of white powder to represent the shape of a pyramid. Traditionally, the powder is made of dirt or clay, ground, and mixed with holy water and blessed by Buddhist monks. As with all of the ceremony\u2019s traditional customs, the ritual is meant to bring good fortune to the couple. (more dots)</p>\n<p>We were ready for the water pouring to commence once we had placed both hands (palms together), overhanging the water pouring table and positioned above flowers that were arranged in a water tray, to capture the water that ran off. Each of the elder guests in turn will take the ceremonial water pouring conch shell (\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e07\u0e02\u0e4c\u0e23\u0e14\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33), which had been freshly filled with holy water from the Buddhist ceremony, and poured a trickle of water from the base of our thumbs to the fingertips over the groom and then the bride. Most also used this opportunity to give us their congratulations and best wishes.</p>\n<h2><center>7.

This is where things got a little weird. This is just a part of the wedding ceremony, we were not going to bed for real just yet. : ) although by this stage I was getting exhausted and could have used a little nap.</p>\n<p>The bed will was prepared by  a married couple who had been happily married for a long time, in this case my mum and dad. Their knowledge and good luck was then imparted to us in a number of different ways. Nine meaningful items were placed on the bed  as symbols of prosperity and fertility. They didn't really know what to do either do we kind of ad-libbed this a bit. But the goods on the bed were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One big brass tray (\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e19\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48)</li>\n<li>A mortar as a symbol of steadily love (\u0e04\u0e23\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e22\u0e32 \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 \u0e08\u0e34\u0e15\u0e43\u0e08\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e41\u0e19\u0e48\u0e19)</li>\n<li>A cane as a symbol of long life (\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49\u0e40\u0e17\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e22\u0e38\u0e22\u0e37\u0e19)</li>\n<li>A green squash as a symbol of happy and peaceful married life (\u0e1f\u0e31\u0e01\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 \u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e40\u0e22\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02)</li>\n<li>A silver bag and gold bag of beans, sesame seeds and baking powder(\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e08\u0e23\u0e34\u0e0d\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e07\u0e32\u0e21\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1f\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1f\u0e39)</li>\n<li>A bowl of rain water as a symbol of harmony (\u0e02\u0e31\u0e19\u0e43\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e1d\u0e19 \u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e31\u0e04\u0e04\u0e35 \u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e43\u0e08\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19)</li>\n<li>A white cat doll as a symbol of liking to stay at home (\u0e15\u0e38\u0e4a\u0e01\u0e15\u0e32\u0e41\u0e21\u0e27\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e02\u0e32\u0e27 \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 \u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19)</li>\n<li>A white chicken as a symbol of early rising  (\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48\u0e02\u0e32\u0e27 \u0e15\u0e37\u0e48\u0e19\u0e14\u0e36\u0e01 \u0e25\u0e38\u0e01\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e32)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tradition states that we the newly-weds must sleep with these objects in the bed for the next 3 nights.

Most do both in the same day with the traditional Thai ceremony in the morning followed by the party in the afternoon or evening. Some couples prefer to do them on a separate day. We did ours on the same day. We got a brief 30 minute respite in which to update our Facebook status (lol) and do a Superman costume change into the afternoon's attire.</p>\n<p>We held the party in an empty field next to the house, which suited me fine, as I'm not a fan of dingy hotel ballrooms. The torrential rain from the night before held off, and apart from a bit of mud underfoot, all was well.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12592469_10208458697167811_570179526128667858_n07e5f.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p>A Thai wedding party is usually large (aka huge). We probably only had about 50 people for the ceremony in the morning but we catered for 800 for the party....Yes 800... Parents will invite almost every single person they know; family members, relatives, colleagues, neighbors and of course it includes the immediate family of those guests. The more people the parents and the couple know, the bigger the wedding. It appears my wife's family knew everyone in the surrounding village even if my wife didn't have a clue who half of them were.</p>\n<p>This is due to the Thai custom about \u2018face\u2019 \u2013 especially if the family has important status in the society. If you don\u2019t invite someone, they will feel insulted and you could lose the relationship with them. Often the wedding of the children is like a reunion party for the parents. For us, it involved lots and lots of picture taking followed by more picture taking.  There was some food in there somewhere, along with a band and some more traditional dancers.<br />\n<center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12647520_10208458164834503_7645634436442074275_n6a48d.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p>Thai people don\u2019t usually give wedding gifts, instead they give cash. When the guest receives the wedding invitation, they will use the envelope of the invitation card to put the cash in. Then when they arrive at the wedding party\u2019s reception, there will be money boxes for the guests to put the cash envelope in. You can also write wishes for the wedding couple in a guest-book prepared at the reception and receive a wedding souvenir.</p>\n<h1><center>Lighting the candles &amp; Cutting the Cake</center></h1>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12647146_10204110386320266_7030143074989390932_n17dcb.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p>Before cutting the cake, the wedding couple will light up three auspicious candles (\u0e40\u0e17\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e21\u0e07\u0e04\u0e25 ).<br />\nAfter that the cake was cut and we served it to out parents and closest relatives first. Pretty sure that big cake was just for show, and we had a smaller one for devouring.</p>\n<h1><center>Eat, Drink and be Merry</center></h1>\n<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent eating, drinking and chatting with the guests who remained. It's quite common for many of the guests to vanish quite quickly, as people get back to work or other activities. Regardless, a group of us stayed on till late in the evening recounting tales of times past.</p>\n<p>When the party was finished, we had to count the money they received and also make a note of the amount of the money they receive from each guest, so when they are invited to the guest\u2019s wedding or the wedding of the guest\u2019s child, they should put more money in the envelope.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/01/12650955_10208458277437318_4345598323686671232_n7c3a9.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<h3><center>Stay tuned for Pt.2</center></h3>\n<p>Part 2: The Thai Beach Wedding, where we have a Western Ceremony by the beach.

Mix the mayonnaise with pickles, olives and finely chopped egg\n\n### 2. Season with olive oil and Worcestershire sauce to taste\n\n### 3. If you want more sophisticated add some white raisins, seeded, chopped\n\n### 4. Place a little of the filling carefully over the slices of ham and wrap them\n\n### 5. Serve on lettuce leaves chopped\n\n### 6. It\u2019s a great cold starter and very decorative\n\n### 7. If you wish to serve as canap\u00e9s, just cut each roll in half and secure with a silver toothpick\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://gustavopasquini.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2-1.png\n\n# About Me\n\n### In 2012 I began my cooking journey in Brasil and studied at \u201cSenac, Juiz de Fora\u201d, in Minas Gerais, developing my basic culinary techniques.\n\n### Later I worked in a local restaurant, and rose to a role in management, helping to increase the clientele base. I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/14/rolls-of-ham-and-mayonnaise/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](http://www.tudogostoso.com.br/receita/46066-rolinhos-de-presunto-e-maionese.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "body": "About two years ago now, my wife Sabrina and I were feeling a little ill, we had been bitten by the travel bug, but couldn't get away. We were stuck in Vancouver Canada, with just about enough money to pay the bills, but not much to do anything else. One thing we really truly love is traveling and exploring places we have never been, but this particular year it was really looking like a trip was just not going to happen. We didn't have the cash, things weren't working out the way we thought they needed to, we resigned to just stay home.\n\nThen out of nowhere, in the span of about a week, we ended up booking 2 jobs that we weren't expecting. Suddenly we had a fist full of cash (actually, a bank account balance slightly higher than normal) and since we had been planning on tightening up the belt as it were, this cash was basically bonus. I got to thinking about it for a day or two, then one afternoon I just turned to Sabrina and said \"Hey, so we've got this money now, do you want to go to China?\" \n\nWe both kinda laughed for a minute, then she said \"Yeah, I really do... do you think we can?\" \n\nTwo days later we had flights booked to Beijing, and 3 nights reserved at a hostel in the city, the rest was up to us to figure out as it came along. We look back at this insane, spontaneous decision with fond memories and warm laughter every time we talk about it. It was the start of one of the best trips we have ever been on together, and we don't regret a single thing. Even when one of our jobs cancelled late, and the person who was going to rent our place canned out last minute (double rent, yay!!), and we ended up running out of money about three quarters of the way into our trip (hi uh mom? yeah, so were in Cambodia, and well, you're not gonna believe this...). \n\nI'll be making more posts as a series eventually covering our entire trip through Asia, but for now I hope you enjoy looking through some of our memories from China!\n\n## Around Beijing\n\n###### Sabrina, on our way to Vancouver airport.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer1f0cd4.jpg\n\n###### On the tarmac at Shanghai, about to board our connecting flight to Beijing.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer68f8570.jpg\n\n###### Sabrina was getting a little tired.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer6370e2b.jpg\n\n###### On the way to Beijing!!\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer3e45da.jpg\n\n###### One of the first images I took in Beijing.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer400960.jpg\n\n###### The alley way leading to our hostel, you can see the sign in the back \"Sunrise Hostel\" \nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer37b44ef.jpg\n\n###### Severe jetlag = waking up at 4:00 in the morning to explore Beijing.\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/DallasKolotyloPhotography-AsiaTravelPhotographer38c6101.jpg\n\n###### Later on that morning we were able to taste one of the worst simulated coffee flavored beverages ever to disgrace the face of this earth.

I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/13/puff-pastry-of-chocolate-and-strawberr/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](http://gshow.globo.com/receitas-gshow/receita/folhado-de-chocolate-e-morango-4ee3599be1608c68880013cf.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "body": "For all in  Steemit!\n\n\nThe melting of the Arctic ice cap due to global warming increasingly alarming. Each year , the sea level rise of 1-3 mm . If not immediately anticipated , rising sea levels is certainly dangerous for the survival of human beings living on the earth surface . Even more dangerous , several major cities in the world was threatened with sinking due to rising sea levels , the foundation is fragile, as well as ground water extraction . The following eight major cities in the world are threatened with drowning.\n\nShanghai,china\n<center>\n<img style=\"border:0px; width:250px; height:120px;\" src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/d9i0vjmzd/405046_queensland_039_s_flood_disaster.jpg\"/>\n</center>\nShanghai was once just a place surrounded by swamp . The need for a place to stay and a population that swells create more and more skyscrapers in the area. Not surprisingly , each year the ground in Shanghai dropped half an inch . Based on data from PBS , the surface of the ground in Shanghai fell by around 2.4 meters within the period 1921 to 1965. Experts estimate that the land in Shanghai no longer able to withstand the heavy loads of building on it . Predicted a time Shanghai will sink if the Yangze River overflowed\n\n\n\nSaigon,Vietnam\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/s97fe437x/Saigon_Flooding.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n\nOne of the most populous cities in Southeast Asia is also in danger of drowning. The reduced surface soil make this area prone to flooding . Each year, the floodwaters rose as high as 2cm.\n\n\nBangkok,Thailand\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/dq72f2v8b/temples_flooded_in_thailand_data.jpg\"/>\n</center>\nHead of the National Disaster Warning Centre of Thailand , Smith Dharmasaroja , predicted in 2100 Bangkok will be the second Atlantis . The city will sink due to several factors , such as : climate change due to greenhouse effect , rising sea levels , coastal erosion , and landslides . Plus it lies low causing Bangkok every year has flooded.\n\nMumbai,india\n\n\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/fgl6hs59n/28sl3.jpg\"/>\n</center>\nNot much different from Bangkok , a group of Greenpeace activists in 2100 memperkitakan Mumbai city will be submerged by seawater . Rising sea levels of up to 5 meters led to the city's community in the town threatened its sustainability.\nMexico,City\n\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/ml22odc4z/f8fcd814_1646_4aaa_ad1e_b4bc111c707c_650x366.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n\nThis one city each year sunk 20cm in case of flooding . It lies in the valley plus the poor drainage system make Mexico City in danger of drowning. Since 1975 , the city's drainage capacity is down 30 percent . But now the government is pushing for the manufacture of drainage tunnel giant who claimed can hold enough water.\n\n\nNew York\n\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/6g8rm99zx/Yellow_cabs_line_a_flood_010.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n\nRising sea levels threaten the city turned out to take part in these United States. Position at the mouth of the Hudson River that connects directly to the Atlantic Ocean helped trigger. Science Daily predict , the city sea water more than doubled compared to other oceans . Not only that , coastal erosion , decreased soil and destruction of the environment can also trigger the overflow of water in the city known as the center of the business world.\n\n\nVenesia,italy\n\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/rzrojow7p/628x471.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n\nThe end of 2012 , the city was flooded badly . This phenomenon is present due to a combination of heavy rain and wind from the south . At least 70 percent of the land in the canal city is flooded with a depth of up to 1.5 meters above normal . Flooding was apparently one of the indications that the region of Venice continues to sink . Christian Science Monitor even noted , the city dropped its surface as long as 30 cm over the last 100 years. The rising water level in the Mediterranean Sea canal city likely add it to sink.\n\n\nJakarta,indonesia\n\n\n<center>\n<img style=\"width:100%; height:75px\" id=\"image\" src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/3m6tky4kr/335370_jakarta_floods.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n\n\nIn addition to the geographical location of which is under sea level , the need for a high water is considered to be one of the causes of the sinking of the mainland Jakarta . Population continues to increase the main reason for the need for groundwater . In a period of 20 years, the estimated number of residents in the capital increase of up to 40 million people.\n\n\nHydrology expert from the Netherlands , Janjaap Brinkman explained that if the soil water suction process continuously carried out , at the end of the 21st century , Jakarta will sink five to six meters deep . A matter of time Jakarta will sink beneath the sea as the city of Atlantis\n\nThese towns are threatened sinking due to rising sea levels and global warming . If we do not change the way we treat the earth , these cities will be completely submerged without we could do anything. Let's start caring for the environment.!!!\n\n\n\n\nComments and Responses You\nVery I would expect to progress I\nAnd I hope you enjoyed reading this post\n\n\nDon't forget to vote and follow me,\nThanks...\n\n\nBest Regars\n\nhttps://s9.postimg.org/7que1vu0v/20150608150705.jpg\n\nSazkia@Siniceku",

    "body": "http://i67.tinypic.com/ncjk03.jpg\n\nThe information below could be helpful to anyone out there who wants to know more about the connection between depression (and other mental illnesses) and creativity. If the findings are correct, and the \"mentally ill\" have so much to offer, then what does this say about how society tends to treat of this segment of society?\n\nConsciousness, introspection, self-awareness, and abstract thinking have no basis in scientific measurement (Swerdlow, 1995). Science, however, seems to be heading in this direction. Humans have this need for explanation, and as such, we have discovered that the planum temporale in the left hemisphere, a part of the brain associated with auditory processing, is larger in musicians than in non-musicians, and is larger still in musicians with perfect pitch. Other research indicates that van Gogh may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy, which triggered electrical hyperactivity of the brain (Swerdlow, 1995).\n\nThere are more recent cases which point to physiology as it effects the creative process. By the 1950\u2019s, Howard Hughes had established himself as a filmmaker, inventor, designer, engineer, industrialist and businessman. By the 1970\u2019s, he was said to be one of the most eccentric people in America, living in isolation, giving out strict orders to his staff on how to maintain cleanliness, once test landing a plane some five thousand times when only twenty or so was necessary, and generally living out a life of extraordinarily bizarre behaviors. Yet, no one questioned this, intervened or even insisted that he get help!! Why? Perhaps, they thought this was common for a creative genius, man of his caliber, or normal for the rich and famous to act peculiar. What we know now is that Howard Hughes was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (Osborne, 1998). PET scans reveal that the brain of someone suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder is overactive, particularly the section known as the caudate nucleus. The entire frontal cortex of a person with this condition literally lights up when compared to a person without the condition. The mental activity that made Hughes a great genius, was also slowly killing him.\n\nWhat I have learned in my study of this disorder is that what makes some people crazy, can also make them creative, or great if they choose. Winston Churchill and Martin Luther, both great leaders in their time, suffered the effects of mental illness. Churchill had terrible depression and Martin Luther, though it wasn\u2019t called this at the time, had obsessive compulsive disorder. Martin Luther was said to be scrupulous, literally asking for forgiveness more than twenty times a day for acts committed that day (Jamision, 1995). There is an endless list of people that I have read or heard about that suffered from mental illness and were also creative. Is there a connection?\n\nIt would be hard to imagine that there is not. The brain is acting in such a way as to stimulate thought, insight, imagination, excitement and emotion. What we do not manifest into some creative outlet is likely to take its toll in another equally profound way. A few years ago, I had a conversation with a doctor concerning his son and his son\u2019s outrageous, counter productive behavior in my classroom. When we discussed the possible reasons, his answer was that his son acted this way, not because he meant any harm or disrespect, but because \u201chis brain required it.\u201d Acting out, creating, being weird, whatever we wish to call it is really the brain\u2019s way of achieving the balance it needs.\n\nEdward O. Wilson, in Consilience, discusses this very notion on the section involving dreaming. He reports that in a dream state, the person is really insane. What he means is that these images, thoughts, impulses, if occurring during a cognizant, awake state would classify any of us as insane. What is going on during one of these states is interesting. The amines that the brain normally produces \u2013 such as norepinephrine and serotonin run low. Wilson suggests that the brain, in a dream state, is compensating for low levels of these chemicals by producing fantastic images. Take this a step further and one can see why artists and creative people tend to be so depressed. They too are compensating. They want so badly to get out of this state and the only option is a creation of their own doing, something so amazing that it literally alters their brain chemistry! It would naturally follow that the deeper one feels depression the more creative they are apt to be. The \"normal\" nine-to-five crowd, to some, is uninspiring and unimaginative. Well, they don\u2019t need to be. Perhaps their brains do not require it.\n\nJulia Cameron (1992), in the Artist\u2019s way, confirms this, though in a less scientific way. She says, that our brightest ideas are often \u201cproceeded by a gestation period that is inferior, murky, and completely necessary.\u201d People seeking to reach that perfect state of creativity toy with these brain levels, trying to find the perfect amount of sadness or joy or whatever emotion will propel their project to great heights of pure creativity. When such levels are insufficient, they turn to exercise, thrill seeking, or worse, coffee, tobacco, alcohol and worse yet, drugs. It is really a never ending battle for the perfect state of being, and the perfect state of creative contribution.\n\nSpalding Gray (1985) writes about this in his cult classic, Swimming to Cambodia. As an actor in the movie The Killing Fields, he swore not to leave Thailand until he had achieved what he called the \u201cperfect moment.\u201d To paraphrase, the perfect moment was to him, that moment when everything came together, producing an amazing experience (Gray, 1985). This was the experience that one would remember most, the experience that would define the journey, the one to tell family and friends about. For Michael Jordan, it was important to leave basketball at the peak of his game, probably in a moment not too different from what Gray was writing about. Jordan, was in effect, the writer of the play on his life. As director, why not make it dramatic, thrilling, emotional, or even perfect?\n\nDoes this have implications for education? Without a doubt it does. Here we are, teachers directing students, literally taking away their control, their ability to form personal meaning and imposing, almost forcing content down their throats. Yet, we somehow expect them to learn from this?! Eric Jensen\u2019s (1998) research in Teaching with the Brain in Mind would probably caution against this, noting that \u201cemotion helps reason to focus the mind and set priorities. Many researchers now believe that emotion and reason are not opposites. For example, our logical side says, \u2018set a goal.\u2019 But only our emotions get us passionate enough even to care enough to act on that goal.\u201d (Daniel Goleman, 1995) argues that emotions are equally important to basic logic when making a decision. Perhaps the answer to this is to allow the students more control in decision making, in personal choice making, not just at home but at school.\n\nNote: This was excerpted from a paper I wrote while attending graduate school in Chico, CA.",

    "body": "http://i.imgur.com/s1ax1cU.jpg\n\n### I've recently started watching a new show called \"Startup\" on the Crackle streaming platform. The show, which is set in Miami, is about 3 people from completely different walks of life getting together to create a (stable)cryptocurrency to change the world.  It made me think about my decision to move back to Miami, and I wanted to share with you.  \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QVMcQUH.jpg\n###### The ride back to Downtown from South Beach\n\n\nA year ago, my boyfriend and I both quit our jobs at the same time to work on his crypto project full time.  It was one of the scariest, exciting, and fulfilling periods of my life.  We were living together in Queens, NY at the time and were quickly becoming disillusioned with the expense, stress, sounds, and smells of New York City life.  We mused about moving all over the world from Spain, to Thailand, Germany, Texas, the list went on...\n\nI thought long and hard about suggesting my hometown of Miami--I thought I had left it for good.  I was born in Miami Beach and spent most of the first 18 years of my life living with my family in the same house in North Miami.  Both of my parents worked a lot, so I spent a lot of time with my nanny, \u00cdnes, from Colombia.  I speak Spanish to her and English to my parents.  \n\nI got to grow up in a place where I was exposed to people from pretty much every different background you could imagine.  I got to live in the aftermath of our diplomatic interaction with Cuba.  Many of my friend's parents came to Miami on the [Mariel boatlift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariel_boatlift).  I got to learn Creole and eat amazing things my parents never would have exposed me to (for example, [Goat Curry](http://caribbeanpot.com/the-ultimate-curry-goat-recipe/)...YUM!!) with my friends from school.  I got to spend weekends sailing to islands with my Dad's \"boat friends\", shooting the shit, snorkeling, soaking up sun, and getting salty hair curls.  I've seen alligators, crocs, manatees, dolphins, peacocks, and so much more living in the wild.  I can't believe it took me leaving to realize how lucky I was.  \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/l9HLcTC.jpg\n###### Playing Apples to Apples at Sea on New Years\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/J8knNOj.jpg\n###### Gators in the Everglades on a High School Field Trip\n\n## After a lot of thought,  we decided on Miami, and (if you need less nostalgic reasons) here's why:\n\n\n### No Snow\n\nYup, that's right!  Toss out your winter coats, cause you don't need 'em! It's warm and sunny almost all the time (yes, we get hurricanes) Every year at Christmas I float in a pool and drink eggnog.  It's flip flops and sundresses all year round!  Beach Picnic for Valentine's Day?  No problem.  Halloween Pool Party?  Go for it! In Miami, outdoors is always an option. (Again, unless there's a hurricane.  Then don't go outside.)\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JfucfI8.jpg\n###### My Old Backyard Shortly Before a Hurricane\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XShlu8K.jpg\n\n### More Money\n\nIf you're going to live in the US, there are few states where you [don't pay State Income Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_income_tax#States_with_no_individual_income_tax).  Florida is one of them.  When I lived in NYC, I had to pay Federal, State, AND City Income Tax on my low, early-stage-startup salary.  You don't end up getting much of a take home--even if you make good money.  In Florida, not only are the taxes low, but since we're have a major import port and things don't have to travel very far to get to our stores, everything-especially food-is much cheaper.  My rent is much lower than in NYC, too, and I get to live more central to the city, which I like.  More money also means a longer runway for your startup and investors money goes a longer way!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JjHV1vu.jpg\n###### Getting Some Juice Straight from The Grove!\n\n### Startup Friendly\n\nIn 2015, [Miami passed San Jose and reached up to the #2 city for Startup Activity in the US](http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-is-now-number-two-for-startup-activity-7802965).  Last year, Miami also had the highest concentration of startups by population.  Because of reasons one and two, there's a lot of investor Money in the city of Miami.  Rich old guys love to retire here, play golf, and fund pet projects.  Anecdotally, I've seen a lot more VC activity this year in Miami than I've seen in the last couple years.  We've started to get [hip coding bootcamps](https://wyncode.co/), [innovation centers](https://www.microsoftinnovationcenters.com/locations/miami), startup oriented co-working spaces--all with Miami cultural flare (and, of course, our new, delicious, [local craft brews](https://www.timeout.com/miami/bars/best-craft-beer-bars-in-miami)).  \n\n### Excitement\n\nIf you hear something weird on the news, chances are, it probably happened in Florida.  From [throwing gators into drive through windows](http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2016/04/08/video-released-customer-throwing-alligator-through-wendys-drive-thru/), to (multiple!!) [face-eating incidents](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article95896387.html), to the good ol' days of the [Cocaine Cowboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_Cowboys), you can bet that you'll never be bored in Florida.  \n\n### My Parents Moved to Sarasota\n\nSorry Mom and Dad, I love you guys, but I want at least a couple hours between us so I can live my life.  Lucky for me, it's a nice 3 hour drive right across Alligator Ally.  Many of my friend's parents moved over there after we went to University or moved out.  \n###### Side note: @charlieshrem I'm so sad I can't come up visit my parents and go to your dinner chat because I'm going to Devcon, but I REALLY want to meet you.  I hope you're down here again soon! \n\n\n## So, why are all you startup guys killing yourselves to live in NYC or Cali?  Come unwind, thaw out, and get your hustle on! [DAL\u00c9!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2OLJIbfTm8)\n\n## -Kat\n### Forever a Miami Baby\nhttp://i.imgur.com/g6TA5vS.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/d7amgmp.jpg",

My name is Jane, of course it\u2019s an alias.  I studied economics at a top university in Thailand but I wasn\u2019t as good as my friend, Lena.  Lena by that time was chubby and had acne scars on her pinkish cheeks.  She was the smartest student in our class.  She\u2019s fluent in English because she\u2019s from an international school in Bangkok while I\u2019m from the countryside.  I consider my English to be poor.  We both stayed in the university dorm because our university is far from Bangkok.  While I stayed at the dorm throughout the semester, Lena would go back home every weekend.  We became close friends as freshmen because we shared classes and activities together.  That changed when we turned sophomores because we were in different majors and rarely had a chance to talk anymore.  As far as I know, she got first class honor when she graduated.  Then we lost complete contact after that.\n \nFor those who don\u2019t know what a pathological liar is, I have a short explanation here.  Pathological liars are people who continually lie or make up stories that never exist in their lives.  Their lying tends to be their normal manner or habit.  You can find more information here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_lying .  Anyway, after 7 years I graduated in 2015.  Thanks (or maybe no thanks) to Facebook, I finally met Lena again.  I added her as a Facebook friend and according to her profile it seems like she\u2019s changed a lot from when I knew her during our freshman year at the university.  Lena is slimmer!  There are not many pictures of her on Facebook.  As I can tell from her pictures on Facebook, Lena seemed to be so shy.  I can\u2019t see her face clearly.  I only remember her long, light, beautiful, brown hair as she always dyed it when she was at the university.  She also seemed to have a luxurious life.  She always checked in at hi-class restaurants, posting food pictures.  Dozens of likes and comments about her life and food are always common as she had over 300 friends on Facebook; \u201cI\u2019m so jealous\u201d, \u201cI want to go to that restaurant\u201d, \u201cYou are so beautiful\u201d.  As for me, I can only afford one of those luxurious dinners a month or less because my mortgage already takes out one third of my salary.\n \nOne day, while I was walking in a city center department store, I noticed that Lena checked in at the same department store as I was.  I spontaneously texted her on Facebook messenger: Hey Lena, I saw you check in, I\u2019m at Paragon (the department store) too!  She replied, \u201cNice, wanna meet up? I\u2019m at Mandarin Oriental Shop B floor with my boyfriend and his parents\u201d (oooh, that's a very luxurious shop).  She offered \u201cI can go out and meet you at the food court for a minute\u201d.  I spontaneously replied \u201cNope, it\u2019s ok. Thanks for asking. You\u2019re with your bf's parents. I don\u2019t think you should leave them.  We can meet later.  I won\u2019t\u2019 bother you.  Enjoy dinner!  Here\u2019s my number and line ID, we can talk via line.\"  Note to reader: In Thailand, Line is the most popular messenger app.  You can also create a group chat and so on.  \n\nThat night Lena sent me line message.  Hey Jane.  I\u2019m so sorry for today.  I wanna meet you!  How is life?  I saw you on Facebook.  What are you doing?  Lots of questions, lots of updates came in that night and days after.  Lena told me her story about her family, boyfriend and friends.  Her family business sells tractors and luxurious cars.  Lena wants to open a coffee shop chain in a new (being built) department store but her father asked that she do more research before investing in this business.\n\nLena has a boyfriend, Tim, who owns a tour company.  They\u2019ve been dating for 1 year.  She has a close friend named Jonathan, aka Jonno.  Lena told me that she does\u2019t have many friends and Jonno is the closest one. The reason why they are so close is because Jonno is a friend and also an employee to Lena\u2019s father who's hired him to take care of her almost 24/7 with a salary of 5K (Me: what the\u2026!!!).  Since Jonno is gay, her father trusts him to do this job (taking care of her like a nanny).  \n\nOne day we manage to meet for dinner.  Finally, an in-person meeting!  I met Lena at a restaurant.  When she walked into the restaurant Lena looked so gorgeous. Lena is so slim now.  She\u2019s prettier than she was at the university. Lena explained that the reason she is so slim is because she got brokenhearted by her ex who is a consul. They lived far apart. They rarely met. She also told me that her current boyfriend is so boring. They had bad SEX! (Me: Oyyoiyoi! She was telling me her private life!). We caught up a lot and she said she will introduce Jonno to me later when we meet again.  Oh my! I became closer to her after the first meeting. (to be continued)",

I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/12/beef-fillet-wellington/)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465",

To stay vegan we have to plan and do a bit of research. We have to know what we\u2019re eating and where it came from. It\u2019s always good to ask around for a personal recommendation. Sometimes that\u2019s tougher the more that we travel.\n\nMost of us use [HappyCow](https://www.happycow.net/) as a veg* travel resource before we go. Here we are going to look at the cities with the most vegan restaurants, and then we have some recommendations from HappyCow\u2019s International Ambassadors on their personal favorites in those cities. Enjoy!\n\n**TOKYO, JAPAN**\nTokyo is the most populous metropolitan area in the world with an area of 2,188 square kilometers (845 square miles), there are over 13 million people. The city has everything and is one of the fashion capitols of the world. It also has over 175 vegan and vegan-friendly restaurants. It is not only a densely populated city, but it is also one of the safest in the world. There are thousands of sites to see, places to shop, and even Buddhist temples to sit and relax in.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Pure Cafe Toyko**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Ain Soph.Journey**\n\n*Hanada Rosso \u201cFresh, healthy and comforting\u2026\u201d*\n\n \n\n**HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM**\nA city of 9 million people, this is a vibrant and exciting city. Formerly known as Saigon, in recent years, Ho Chi Minh City has become an important trade and tourism hub for the entire world. The city is filled with sights and sounds that can be found nowhere else. The unique culture of Vietnam is embodied in this bustling and dynamic modern city.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Hum** \u2013 Hum is a fine dining vegan/vegetarian experience that expounds the health benefits of food. They \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even offer a great variety of raw dishes.\n\n*We ate delicious mushroom spring rolls, a coconut and jicama clay pot and a fermented bean tofu dish. To die for! \u2013 geminibec17*\n\n \n**NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK**\nWith a population of eight and half million within the city as well as millions more less than 50 miles away, this is one of the greatest metropolises in the world. With Broadway, dozens of museums, many of the world\u2019s most iconic buildings, and a culture that is legendary, there are few places that you can visit that are more complete than New York City. One amazing fact: There are over 800 languages spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse place in the world.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Blossom** \u2013 Not just some of the best vegetarian dining in the world, Blossom is considered one of the finest \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restaurants in New York, period.\n\n*The food was absolutely wonderful! Great atmosphere and friendly staff as well \u2013 I highly recommend it. \u2013 kelskris*\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**HanGawi (Korean)**  HanGawi is one of the most popular all vegan restaurants in the city. They feature many traditional vegan foods from Korea, including mountain roots and grains.\n\n*I was blown away by the creative, vegan Asian menu. There was so much choice and everything I ate was perfect. \u2013 FrancescaRose*\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Candle 79** \u2013 One of the best reviewed vegan restaurants in the New York City, they even have an organic wine and sake bar.\n\n*Unbelievable menu, great atmosphere, fabulous service! May come back again tomorrow!!! \u2013 christincollins*\n\n<center>http://www.happycow.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12079544_10156200660945331_1506718634851976835_n.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://www.happycow.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12046801_10156200660720331_2402665931858566839_n.jpg</center>\n<center>**Peacefood\u2019s Raw Lasagna**</center>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Peacefood** \u2013 International vegan food at its finest with raw foods, juices and even a bakery.\n\n*This place lived up to my expectations and I would gladly go again. Amazing food and an amazing vibe! \nAmanda7196*\n\n*Franchia \u2013 The sister restaurant to HanGawi, this wonderful restaurant offers modern international vegan foods.*\n\n*Great service, high quality food, amazing atmosphere \u2013 reneeareneea*\n\nhttp://www.happycow.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Kopps-Berlin-1.jpg\n**BERLIN, GERMANY**\nBerlin is one of the most vegan-friendly cities in the world. Europe\u2019s most populous city has a history that dates back to the Roman Empire and before. At the heart of the world\u2019s most influential countries, Berlin is a city filled with fun things to do and great places to eat. For hundreds of years, Berlin has been the crossroads of Europe and a vital part of the world economy.\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Cafe V** \u2013 German-style dishes made with tofu and seitan. They also have pizza and much more.\n\n*This is absolutely still my favourite veggie place in Berlin, as well as in Germany. \u2013 hack_man*\nhttp://www.happycow.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Kopps-Berlin-2.jpg\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Kopps** \u2013 Kopps offers an outstanding 5-course prix fixe menu. There is an outstanding wine list and lovely food.\n\n*Just finished the 5 course menu. Enjoyed every bite of it. \u2013 RobertHol*\n\n*Yellow Sunshine \u2013 This is an inexpensive vegan fast food restaurant serving traditional German and international foods.*\n\n*This was possibly THE BEST vegan burger I\u2019ve ever had and I had more than a few. \u2013 k-girl80*\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Sfizy Veg** \u2013 Pizza, pasta, and Panini sandwiches \u2013 need we say any more?\n\n*Nice cozy restaurant with a relaxed feeling. Highly recommended. \u2013 daniellundh*\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Vego Foodworld** \u2013 This restaurant has many traditional fast foods, all delicious and vegan.*\n\n*Fun & novel vegan junk-food run by a company that makes vegan chocolate bars. \u2013 Exquire*\n\n \n\n**BANGKOK, THAILAND**\nThere are few cultures that are as wonderfully unique and exciting as Thailand. The food of the country reflects the thousands of years of culture and tradition that people have been cooking here. The vegan food culture shares these flavors. Be sure to visit the ancient temples and modern architecture when you are in this astounding city.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Govinda** \u2013 Upscale Italian dining in the heart of Bangkok Thailand. Your brain might be confused, but your taste buds won\u2019t be.\n\n*Finally a vegetarian Italian getaway in Bangkok. Grazie mille! \u2013 SteffySteff*\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**May Veggie Home** \u2013 May Veggie Home offers many faux meats, including oyster mushroom curry and more.\n\n*I have been to this restaurant 3x in the past two days. \u2013 dianebash*\n\nhttp://www.happycow.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/11109149_1057869664227668_1160167205790668315_n.jpg\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Mango** \u2013 A mix of Thai and western foods with an art gallery and even free Wi-Fi, Mango is modern vegan dining and culture mixed together.\n\n*Really friendly staff/owners and excellent food highly recommend. \u2013 Changiboy*\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Jay Vegetarian Restaurant** \u2013 A vegetarian/vegan buffet\u2026 doesn\u2019t that sound amazing? It\u2019s worth the trip to Jay Vegetarian Restaurant.\n\n*\u201cI really love this authentic stall, run by a lovely woman in a small lane: http://www.happycow.net/reviews/jay-vegetarian-restaurant-bangkok-54690 It\u2019s about $1 for a buffet-style meal. There are a couple of dishes with egg, but she understands the word egg.\u201d*\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Baan Suan Pai**\u2013 One of the best reviewed in Thailand, this restaurant is located in the courtyard of a yoga and retreat compound.\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s a much fancier food court but still not expensive at all, maybe 2-3$ per meal. That\u2019s really close to the BTS station.\u201d Jule Kunkel*\n\n Thank you to HappyCow Ambassadors who shared with me their favorite restaurants in these fine cities!\n\nThis compilation was from a casual poll. I asked the ambassador group, on Facebook \"What is your favorite vegan city and restaurant?\"  This list is not inclusive or global, just a poll, thank you for understanding.  I'd love to know your choices too!\n\n*Images are from restaurants with explicit permission from each restaurant.

The company's first machine is located in city\u2019s Financial District at the intersection of Yonge and Adelaide. \u201cEnter the Deloitte entrance off Yonge St. and go up the escalator,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RubixByDeloitte/status/773620101476077569\">tweeted</a> the firm's blockchain team, Rubix by Deloitte (Rubix).</p>\n<p>Deloitte is comprised of the UK private company, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, and a network of independent member firms. Following a revenue <a href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/global-revenue-announcement.html\">announcement</a> on Wednesday, Deloitte has overtaken PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as the largest of the 'Big Four' accounting firm by revenue, earning US$36.8 billion last year. PwC has yet to release its 2016 earnings, but <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/about/global-annual-review-2015/revenues.html\">generated</a> US$35.4 billion in 2015. The Canadian member firm of Deloitte, Deloitte LLP, has 56 locations and 8,820 employees and headquarters in Toronto. The firm <a href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/about-deloitte-canada.html\">reported</a> annual revenue of $2.088 billion in 2015.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/deloitte-launches-rubix-a-one-stop-blockchain-software-platform/\">Deloitte founded Rubix in 2014</a>, exclusively to develop enterprise blockchain applications. \u201cRubix bridges the gap between the exponentially innovative nature of blockchain technology and the complexity of existing enterprise system environments,\u201d states the website.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe goal is to make bitcoin more accessible so that users can experience blockchain technology first hand,\u201d explained Iliana Oris Valiente, the original founder and strategy leader of the Rubix team. This will \u201cdeepen their understanding and ultimately increase adoption,\u201d she added. The BTM only needs a mobile phone number to be used.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/rlgnll1dr/image2.jpg\" width=\"907\" height=\"199\"/></center></p>\n<p>The bitcoin-dispensing machine was manufactured by <a href=\"https://www.bitaccess.co/\">Bitaccess</a>, an Ottawa-based bitcoin ATM maker founded in 2013. The company\u2019s base model sells for $7,000 CAD. Rubix has been collaborating with the start-up over the past few months.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeloitte has shown themselves to be a leader in financial innovation through their Rubix team,\u201d said Bitaccess co-founder Moe Adham. \u201cPartnering with Deloitte on this project is a natural fit for Bitaccess. It further advances our mission to commercialize blockchain technologies.\u201d</p>\n<p>The BTM industry has been <a href=\"https://coinatmradar.com/charts/\">growing steadily</a> in recent years. An independent BTM information portal,<a href=\"http://coinatmradar.com/\">CoinATMRadar</a>, shows that new BTMs are installed globally at a rate of 1.29 per day. A global total of 775 BTMs are shown on the site at press time, having nearly doubled over the past year.</p>\n<p>62 of the machines are manufactured by Bitaccess, located in 11 different countries throughout North America, Europe, and Thailand. The site <a href=\"https://coinatmradar.com/operators/\">lists</a> a total of 17 manufacturers and 28 operators of BTM networks. Giving Bitaccess an 8% market share. The company is the fourth largest BTM manufacturer behind Genesis Coin, Lamassu, and General Bytes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/wy5hzppa7/BTM_market_share_9_sep_2016.png\" width=\"699\" height=\"396\"/></center></p>\n<p>Deloitte\u2019s BTM adds to the existing list of 12 BTMs in downtown Toronto. The surrounding cities bordering Toronto together offer 31 BTM locations, giving Deloitte\u2019s new machine plenty of competition.</p>\n<p>Canada has been the primary proving grounds for BTM adoption, ever since the world\u2019s first BTM was installed in downtown Vancouver, at Waves Coffee shop in October 2013. The price of a bitcoin was US$200 at the time. The very next day, bitcoin began its steepest climb ever, reaching its all-time high of $1,200 within a month.</p>\n<p>The Canadian government <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/law/help/bitcoin-survey/#canada\">offers</a> an extra light regulatory environment. There is no regulation for BTM machine owners or manufacturers, since they are not considered money transmitters. However, there are proposed regulations on digital currency businesses.</p>\n<p>A July 2014 economic action plan <a href=\"http://www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/new-neuf/avs/2014-07-30-eng.asp\">proposed</a> that existing Money Service Businesses, who deal in \u201cvirtual currencies,\u201d should register themselves with FINTRAC, in order to fight money laundering and become compliant with the Terrorist Financing Act.</p>\n<p>By increasing access and understanding of bitcoin, Deloitte hopes that people will be \u201cbetter prepared to embrace and respond to the advancement of blockchain,\u201d according to Ian Chan, Partner and Deloitte\u2019s Exponentials and Innovation Leader.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/j5vohtnwf/image3.jpg\" width=\"907\" height=\"198\"/></center></p>\n<p>Many regulators, companies, and academic institutions have said blockchain has the potential to <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/industry-research-papers-highlight-blockchain-technologys-disruptive-potential/\">disrupt various industries</a>.

Also for freelancers need a good Internet, the average speed is in Chiang Mai - 20 Mbit / s, which is, in principle, tolerant. As a bonus - a lot of cafes with free Wi-Fi.</p>\n<h1>2. Bangkok, Thailand</h1>\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/jggfo5m8b/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s9.postimg.org/cpzyepz2n/p_4_58082.jpg' border='0' alt='p-4-58082'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/index.php?lang=russian'></a><br /><br />\n<p>Bangkok can be described roughly as well as Chiang Mai. Comfort, speed internet infrastructure and about the same. There is little difference in climate (south of Bangkok, so it is warmer) and the considerable difference in housing prices, which is not strange since Bangkok - Thailand's capital. So, a month renting an apartment you need to pay almost twice as much than in Chiang Mai.</p>\n<h1>3.

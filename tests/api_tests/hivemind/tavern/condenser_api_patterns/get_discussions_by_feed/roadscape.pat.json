How about an actor or actress that keeps pumping out great movies?\n\nThis is a phenomenon that is common on social media also. I regularly see great minds come on the scene but they all of a sudden disappear into the shadows. Their Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus go eerily silent. Where did these people go? \n\nThen you have folks like my friend [Michael Q Todd](https://steemit.com/@mqtodd) who is always around. He may be working on different projects but he always finds time to engage his followers across social media. The sad part is that the folks like Michael are very rare.\n\nThe key to Michael and I's success is not that we put out the best content. There are plenty of people online who are better writers, content producers or marketers. The key to our success is consistency. We are here day after day, week after week, year after year learning, engaging with our audience and building our personal brands.\n\n<center>http://www.randyhilarski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Attract-Your-Dreams-Focus-Small-Things-Eric-Thomas-Randy-Hilarski.jpg</center>\n\nIf I look back at the amount of people who I have met online that have chosen to let their personal brand grow idle, it gives me great sadness. You see the most important thing that you own online is your personal brand. I don't care what platform you are on.\n\nYou and I are probably not whales on Steemit so we have to approach the platform differently. You and I need to provide quality content on a consistent basis. On top of that we need to connect, engage and network with other Steemit users. \n\nDid you know I check all of your profiles before I follow you? It seems the biggest complainers are the ones who follow very few people and produce crap content. Or they wrote one piece of content that performed poorly weeks ago.\n\nLet me tell you a little secret about Steemit. The audience you build here will follow you to other platforms if you provide enough value and show them that you are authentic. What we are going to find in the coming months is that many folks will quit Steemit because they feel they did not get any value out of it. \n\nThese folks are the short term thinkers who find a way to complain about everything in life. Don't mind them, you are reading this because you want to be successful.\n\nFocus on the Steemit end game. This platform might exponentially grow or die a slow death but in the end you can and will make lasting relationships on this platform.\n\n<center>http://www.randyhilarski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Obsessive-Authenticity-Robert-Greene-Randy-Hilarski.jpg</center>\n\nDon't be a Steemit voyeur! Get into the game today. Start making content consistently. I don't care if you feel like it is not good enough. Start learning how to write, make videos or make images. They are all content that can be consumed throughout social media and Steemit. \n\n## Be Obsessive!! ##",

Click my name to follow me and check out my blog for the Preamble and Parts 1-2. All names are changed to protect inmates privacy.*\n\nMarch 31st, 2015 \n\nWoke up around 7am, barely slept through the night. The total shock of yesterday is starting to kick in. Omar said it would be super hard to sleep and he was right, but the earplugs helped a little. I took a shower this morning, there wasn\u2019t much of a wait. Using the showers are like trying to land an airplane on a runway with no traffic control. All the planes that are waiting to land and take off are speaking to each other directly. \n\nTo prevent yourself from crossing someone else you wait outside and yell: \n\n> Showers\n\nEveyone in the showers will reply\n\n> 1 on the right, 2 on the left\n\nMeaning there is 1 person on the right and 2 on the left, so there is a right shower empty. Then I say. \n\n> Coming in on the right\n\nI go into the changing room area assigned to my shower and say\n\n> In on the right\n\nWhen I\u2019m ready to cross into the shower I say\n\n> Crossing on the right \n\nAnd I let them know when I\u2019m in the shower. When I\u2019m finished, I do the same but backward. \n\n[![shower.jpg](https://s16.postimg.org/5y3oypyr9/shower.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/8s6uc60xd/)\n\nI was issued my khakis today and I have to wear them from 7am until 4pm. After 4pm I can dress down into shorts or sweatpants. They are olive green and not the most comfortable things in the world. \n\nIt feels weird not using a cell phone and technology. Everything here is word of mouth, there is no google and information is trickled in. I think the hardest part is learning how to use my own resources to grow and not the internet. I need to learn how to read bullshit and filter through wrong information to find the right answers. Your word is your life here, we all live together so if you don\u2019t follow through, no one else will trust you. Information travels fast here. The slang for when you hear about a rumor or unverified information is \u201cI heard it on Inmate.com\u201d\n\nOn the outside, I had this Bitcoin celebrity status. In here, no one knows me nor do they care about me. I\u2019m just inmate 92164-054. As I walk through the range, using the rest room, making coffee I notice some hateful stares. People have their every day routine. Some for 1, 5, even 10 years and here I am going about it like I own the place. I need to change that attitude and humble myself. How do I stay out of someones way but at the same time still be assertive? Everything is such a fine line here. If you back down you are a wuss, and if you stand up for yourself you go to the hole. I have a lot to learn. \n\nAfter my shower I spoke to Courtney and had a 12 minute call. This used up my 10 minute allocation for the day and 2 minutes of tomorrow but it was my first day and really needed to talk to her. \n\nShe found the visitor form on the BOP website and is printing and mailing it today. The visits are once a month Saturday and Sunday from 8am - 3pm. You get 1 weekend a month which is based on the last digit of your register number and last name. My number ends in 4 which is an even number and my last name ends in an S so my weekend is coming up this week! If I can\u2019t get her approved in a few days, I won\u2019t be able to see her for 5 weeks. On the outside I\u2019m so used to things being done within minutes of when I want it to be done, but in prison I have to learn to get used to things taking days sometimes weeks. I can\u2019t always get what I want when I want it, this is a thinking error as I would later learn. \n\nHere in Lewisburg, I learnt that there is a program called RDAP. The Residential Drug Abuse Program. RDAP is the prisons most intensive treatment program. Cognitive Behavior Therapy is used in a modified therapeutic community model where inmates experience living in a pro-social community. Inmates live in a unit separate from general population; they participate in half-day programming and half-day work, school, or vocational activities for 9 months. In reality, RDAP is 24 hours a day because your life in prison revolves around it. If you graduate, you can get time taken off your sentence from 6 months to 1 year. The program focuses less on drugs, more on dissecting your life and rational thinking. Why do you feel the way you do and how does that effect your actions and reactions. I may try and get into the program. I would get to go home earlier and it would help in my quest bettering myself. \n\n[![Dining-hall-e1411760469932.jpg](https://s16.postimg.org/ltsj20pbp/Dining_hall_e1411760469932.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/ruq7z3bxt/)\n\nSkipped lunch today because the line was too long. Lunch is served around 1030am and follows a 5 week menu. Wednesdays are burgers, and Thursday is chicken so those are the best days. Today they were serving chicken patties, although I\u2019m not sure if there is chicken in it. I think I\u2019m going to be a vegetarian in here. You wait on line, scan your ID card and get a tray which is what you may have used in school. Usually for lunch is a protein, a carb, vegetable and fruit. Today was chicken patty on a bun with baked potatoes and green beans. For dessert an apple or bag of chips. To be honest, some of the food isn\u2019t bad but I guess its because it was all I was used to. Unfortunately, the seating choices are as diverse as I\u2019m used to being from Brooklyn. \n\nI will likely make some soup in a few minutes of ramen and mackerel with some adobo, jalape\u00f1os and garlic powder. I miss Courtney a lot but I need to focus on getting out. We speak in the morning and we say good night to each other on the phone. During the day we email as well. \n\nTo use the email, you log into the prison intranet on one of the computers. You can add someone to your contract list and it emails the contact asking if they want to communicate with you. If they accept, you can start sending emails. It costs $0.05 a minute and there is a 90 minute delay from when you send an email to the person receiving it and vice versa. When you log out you have to wait 30 minutes before logging back in. \n\n[![Lewisberg Bunk.jpg](https://s16.postimg.org/6wk210c39/Lewisberg_Bunk.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/rgovzhru9/)\n\nMy locker is more like a pantry. I have candy, tuna fish, chicken breast, various drinks, ramen, soups, soy and hot sauce. Everything is either shelf stable or in powdered form. I\u2019ve seen some of the guys cooking up some crazy things, but right now ramen is as far as my culinary skills go. \n\nAn hour ago I watched CNN with Shimi. Shimi is the personal injury lawyer I mentioned earlier and he lives in Range 1, downstairs from me. He has been helping me out alot and I\u2019ve been shadowing him. Tonight he said after dinner I can go play spades with him and some other guys. \n\nEveryone in my Unit is pretty cool for like the first five minutes. I\u2019v noticed after that, either they become hostile towards me or ignore me all together. Overall its like living in a small town with minimal outside communication. In the bunk next to me is Tommy, a former judge from the midwest. I look forward to getting to know him. \n\nI used the bathroom earlier and a few minutes after I got out noticed a lot of hostile stares from guys in the range. I couldn\u2019t figure out why. When Omar got back from work I asked him and he spoke to some of the guys. He came back and told me that I smelled up the whole range because I did not courtesy flush. Courtesy flush? Yes, while you are sitting on th toilet you have to flush every minute or so because the water starts smelling up the place. He explained to them it was my first day but it was a bad first impression. \n\nAt 7pm after dinner and cards I\u2019m going to try out Yoga. I\u2019ve never done it before, but I\u2019m told its good to have in your routine and helps with stress and anxiety. \n\n\u2026\u2026\n\nDinner was pepper steak with broccoli and soda! Yoga was intense and the classes are offered 3 days a week. It takes you out of mental prison for an hour so its worth it. \n\nI\u2019m wiped out so I\u2019m going to call Courtney and try to sleep. \n\nI can do this. I think. \n\n-Charlie",

    "body": "Hi you all! Ross and I are so pleased that I\u2019m here and part of this innovative community and technology. I\u2019m glad to have the chance to tell my story directly to you -- to fill you in on the past three years of my life and my battle to free Ross.\n<center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yw2Vy4x-KQ</center>\n\nMy son Ross Ulbricht -- a peaceful, idealistic humanitarian \u2013was  tried and sentenced to double life without parole for all non-violent charges relating to his role in the Silk Road website. Silk Road was a free market experiment: a voluntary, anonymous marketplace that operated on the tor network using the crypto currency bitcoin. Many things, both legal and illegal, were exchanged, although there were restrictions of things considered harmful by the administration. For example, there was no child porn, murder-for-hire or stolen goods on the site. Drug sales were permitted, with marijuana the main product that was bought and sold.\n\nSince Ross\u2019 arrest it\u2019s been a David and Goliath fight against the US government. The investigation, pre-trial events, trial and sentencing are so rife with abuse and corruption that it\u2019s impossible to cover everything. Here are some major issues:\n\n<center> http://i.imgsafe.org/49dec2fca2.png</center>\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a wild and crazy three years to say the least. Since Ross\u2019 arrest I\u2019ve strived to the limits of my strength to direct attention beyond the sensationalism to the important precedents and issues at stake in this case and how they impact our freedoms in the digital age. In addition to Ross\u2019 release, my goal is to shine a light on the alarming loss of our liberty while raising funds to defend Ross. (Any payments from here go 100% to Ross\u2019 defense). This is basically my life now, with some down time sprinkled in.\n\nThings weren\u2019t always like this, and I often shake my head wondering how I got here! Before Ross\u2019 arrest I was the gracefully aging mother of two beautiful, well-adjusted adults, hoping for grandchildren and planning the rest of my life. I had pretty much retired from freelance writing and was continuing to work with Kirk, Ross\u2019 dad, in our business, Casa Bambu. (We rent bamboo houses that Kirk built to vacationers, off grid in the Costa Rican rainforest). One day I led a relatively tranquil life and the next I was falling, like Alice through the looking glass, into a bizarre world of the dark web, encrypted communications, digital currency, and the drug war. A right-brained, tech-resistant ex- hippie, I had only owned a smart phone for a month, had never been on twitter and barely heard of bitcoin (and only from Ross). When Ross was arrested I suddenly -- and urgently -- had to become adept at social media, public relations, fundraising, pgp, bitcoin and criminal law.  \n\nIt was urgent because I had to save my beloved son.\n\n<center>https://i.imgsafe.org/31d2386203.jpg</center>\n<center>Ross and Lyn shortly before his arrest</center>\n\nSo now my life is dominated by the fictional entity Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR) and I\u2019ve been on a crash course to do whatever it takes to free Ross: blog, comment, tweet, follow, unfollow, like, unlike, friend, unfriend, defend, raise funds, encrypt, decrypt, build websites, write press releases, give speeches, give interviews, challenge journalists, translate legalese, learn digital-speak \u2013 and now post on steem.it.  I have twitter followers all over the world, from Russia to Spain, from Australia to India.  I\u2019ve been called a jedi, a storm trooper, Dread Mother Roberts, a hero, a \u201cleading internet freedom activist and social media pro\u201d and a badass (fondly, by the lawyer).  Also some nasty things on the internet, but I\u2019m getting a thick skin.\n\nThe learning curve has been steep. Sensationalistic media; aggressive prosecutors; biased judges; cruel prison staff \u2013 the opponents are formidable and ruthless. But there have also been invaluable allies, like many of you, and that plus divine intervention has gotten us this far.  I have made so many courageous, generous, amazing friends on this journey. They are people I never would have met and it has enriched my life, given me hope. I\u2019ve often thought that the past three years would have been some of the most interesting, purposeful and exciting of my life except that Ross is in prison and that makes them the most traumatic, painful and difficult as well. As long as he\u2019s in there, I will not \u2013 cannot -- rest.\n \n <center>https://i.imgsafe.org/31d247242c.jpg</center>\n<center>Lyn speaking at porcfest.</center>\n\nThis journey has taken me from a prison in interior Brooklyn to an interview in a multimillion dollar Soho loft (on the same afternoon); from high priced attorney offices to clandestine meetings; from a freedom festival in New Hampshire to trudging through Austin streets hanging posters at SXSW (and then speaking there the following year).  Never having addressed audiences, I\u2019ve now spoken at numerous events, both in the US and Europe (including Porcfest, FreedomFest and the national Libertarian convention); appeared on a range of TV, radio and podcast shows, including Reason TV, CNN, HuffPost Live, Infowars and Fox; and given many interviews with both major and alternative media , including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Forbes and The Guardian. Along with Ross, I am prominently featured in the documentary Deep Web.\n\n Never in my wildest dreams would I have believed this would be my fate. \n\nPursuing American justice is expensive and the challenge is great, but I\u2019m fueled by a mother\u2019s love and now a righteous anger at government abuse. I have seen first-hand how prosecutors lie and obstruct. I have visited the prison with other families, desperate to see loved ones, the children tearfully clinging to their fathers. I personally know non-violent people rotting their lives away in captivity.  My perspective has changed forever.\n\nBesides my love for Ross and resistance to tyranny, a crucial thing that keeps me going is my faith in God. I have faced some of the darkest places in my mind, fear gripping me, my thoughts screaming, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this! They\u2019re too big!\u201d Yet I find peace and hope when I can turn the burden over and take on that day\u2019s fight once again. I have felt God\u2019s hand in this throughout, in many ways, large and small. There has been the unlikely but perfect timing of events; the right people arriving at the right time; doors opening when all seemed closed; the impossible occurring against all odds. I pray each day that God will use me, Ross and this situation for good and that it will shine a spotlight on evil. And of course that Ross will be out of that cage, in freedom where he belongs. \n\nThis is a bigger, more far reaching story than one man or website.  There are vital issues at play, ones that impact us all and are worth fighting for. We are in unchartered territory in the courts. Decisions and precedent made now, with the Silk Road case and others, will have far-reaching impact on freedom, innovation, fair trials and privacy.\n\n<center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8gR7jAG2U&amp;list=PLPefjTxHVZSo-zoK-Bap56eihCqhBn75N&amp;index=55</center>\n<center>The Unfairness of the Silk Road trial in 3 minutes</center>\n\nWe are at a crossroads in history. The question and challenge is which road will we take: the one to freedom and innovation, or the one to government intrusion, expansion and control. It is up to us to make sure we take that freedom road.\n\nPlease help us! Of course, please upvote this post. You can also go to FreeRoss.org for lots of other ways to support our battle. You can donate; play the art game; purchase at our store; volunteer; and spread the word on social media and to your network. Everything helps. We\u2019re just one family and some friends. We need you!",

    "body": "![enter image description here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Anonymous-Seal.jpg/1024px-Anonymous-Seal.jpg)\n\n\nA new [article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/zcash-creator-on-the-upcoming-zcash-launch-privacy-and-the-unfinished-internet-revolution-1472568389) just appeared online from the creator of Z-cash. For all who do not know, Z-cash will be the first theoretically proven totally anonymous crypto-currency. There have been others which use sophisticated schemes like ring signatures, stealth transactions, coinjoin, or Tor, but these do not have the theoretical rigor behind them that Z-cash does. Z-cash is a complete anonymity solution which hides all knowledge about the transactions, including the values being transacted, and who the sender or receiver is. As a result, Z-cash is invisible value exchange.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to be too anonymous?\n=====\n\nInvisible value exchange is definitely a double edged sword. You gain privacy which is extremely valuable in the digital environment where there is routine harassment and bullying of people perceived to have \"too much wealth\". At the same time this same technology which can protect a person from being bullied, can enable bullies to be bullies for hire, effectively turning electronic harassment into a trade or business. In the case where it is mercenaries for hire, something like Z-cash would allow a very wealthy individual to turn the tables on freedom fighters, activists, journalists, and developers, who get in the way of corporate or state interests.\n\n\nSo this technology is very much a double edged sword, a two way street, and whomever has the most money in Bitcoin today, may have the most to gain from something like Z-cash. **Note:** a lot of Bitcoins, DAO and other tokens have been stolen by hackers, and at some point this money is going to be spent or need somewhere to go. Z-cash with it's inteesting properties will be most attractive to blackhats and similar hackers who today might be using Bitcoin.\n\n\nThe problem with being totally anonymous\n==========\n\nIf you are totally anonymous then you have no reputation. If you are pseudo-anonymous then you have a reputation. Money isn't really as useful without a good reputation attached to it and as a participant in society, Z-cash probably will not improve the social status of it's users. On the other hand, it is possible that Z-cash can over time adopt features which allow for pseudo-anonymous reputation to be attached to it, but if Z-cash develops a stigma around it then people who have good reputations could end up staying away from it and then it could end up being one of those currencies people are embarrassed to use in public.\n\n\nThe main problem I've identified with being too anonymous is if someone robs a completely anonymous person, the anonymous person has a great difficulty proving they were robbed. Z-cash gets this part right by offering up a concept called a \"view key\" which can be shared with others, so in this way if something does go wrong there is at least a view key which proves the transaction occurred from A to B. A quote from the article:\n\n> . Only those with the correct view key can see the contents. Users have complete control and can opt-in to provide others with their view key at their discretion.\n\n\nGiving the user complete control is a good design decision. This makes Z-cash much more practical, but will that be enough?\n\nPrivacy can improve security by offering confidentiality and access control\n====\n\nPrivacy is a kind of access control and Z-cash provides a user with a greater ability to control access to their financial information. This is good for the security of users, but it is not the case that private by default improves security by default. Transparency can produce security as well and the important point is to know when it's better to be private and when it's better to be transparent, and this really depends on your situation. As long as the technology offers the users the ability to control their level of transparency by determining who can access what, then the technology empowers the users and can improve security.\n\nWhat will law enforcement (FBI) think of Z-cash?\n=========\n\nThe obvious question now is that if Z-cash exists, what is the FBI and other global law enforcement agencies going to do about it?  Politically it doesn't look good for the Z-cash technology ever achieving any kind of mainstream adoption. If the users of Z-cash are limited to the fringe, then they will easily be both socially and politically marginalized. Marginalized groups do not always get favorable treatment by society, and without mainstream adoption, the technology likely will be used as a pretext to further empower law enforcement under the guise that only the \"bad guys\" would be associated with a technology like Z-cash.  As mentioned before, social currency or social status is just as important as money, and if there is a social stigma put on Z-cash by law enforcement, politicians, and high status individuals, then it will probably be just another cypherpunk toy that the masses mock in movies as we see with Bitcoin.\n\nConclusion on Z-cash\n====\n\n\nZ-cash is a very interesting technology, potentially it has uses, but in the current political environment I would expect the positive uses to be overshadowed by the irresponsible uses. So from a researcher perspective, it's very interesting for sure, but from a practical or \"investor\" perspective, I do not expect it to catch on with the mainstream. If it doesn't catch on with the mainstream then it will be marginalized, and likely over time broken (compromised?) by the FBI and similar agencies just as Tor has been broken. Z-cash is a nice technological breakthrough that the world is not politically ready to accept or understand.\n\nAt the same time looking at the markets, I do expect Z-cash could get pumped pretty high as there is demand for it's utility as we see with Monero and Dash. Z-cash is the best technology for it's use case and going forward I do not see how Bitcoin will be able to continue to compete for the same demographic. \n\n\nReferences\n\n1. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/zcash-creator-on-the-upcoming-zcash-launch-privacy-and-the-unfinished-internet-revolution-1472568389\n2. http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/government-contractor-tor-malware/\n3. http://www.coindesk.com/europe-build-database-digital-currency-users/\n4. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/zcash-creator-on-the-upcoming-zcash-launch-privacy-and-the-unfinished-internet-revolution-1472568389",

We actually had stopped working on it much and were moving onto a much more ambitious project when we received the message it had been greenlit.   This happened a few weeks before I discovered **steem and steemit.com**.

These are current developer blogs and posting them should help inspire me to keep pushing forward.\n\n**Where we were at pre-greenlight:**\n<ul>\n<li>Completely redone character/avatar art</li>\n<li>Vast amount of the UI are redone for a new approach.   Not yet implemented in code.</li>\n<li>In house level editor - not likely to be released to the public anytime soon</li>\n<li>Designed as multiplayer from ground up, even when playing single player it treats it as a client/server configuration</li>\n<li>Host, and Join servers with the randomized map and background successfully being shared.</li>\n<li>Two alien races planned by design</li>\n<li>Image File system for combining 3D assets, particles, and 2D into a single performance friendly image at runtime</li>\n<li>Expanded infestation</li>\n<li>More sounds, More Art, more of everything...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vGDCH78.png\"/>\n\n<h1>What happened when we were greenlit?</h1>\nWe signed a big NDA and can't go into details of what goes on behind the scenes but it did open a wealth of opportunities to explore with their large Steam API with many features.\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Ypoulfu.png\"/>\n\nI began reworking the code to use Steam's built in Peer to Peer networking with the idea of completely being able to support inviting friends from your friends list and hosting games the way so many games are natively hosted on Steam.    This requires some work on my backend networking code.    I had that more or less handled and needing testing when I discovered **steemit**.\n\n@theanubisrider kept working on his tasks and has converted all the ship sprites to instead be 2 triangle rectangular planes in 3D that we then can use an atlas with and still use things like Normal Maps, Height Maps, Illumination Maps, Occlusion Maps, etc.      This will make the ships in the game appear more 3D and actually respond to lighting situations as though they were 3D while still being performance friendly.\n\n\n<h1>Screenshots</h1>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/4acokvx.jpg\"/>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tnw48qE.jpg\"/>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/MM6e8mN.jpg\"/>",

contemplative mood over the last few days. &nbsp;The main reason for this that I am due to have surgery on my left eye this Thursday (1st September) - sorry for constantly bringing it up and being such a wimp. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The surgery is routine and is in some ways self-inflicted - it is due to a complication with having had laser eye surgery last year to correct my vision. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Had I not had that done I wouldn't be in this position (although) I don't regret it. &nbsp;No procedure is without risk and since this is a second procedure the risk is increased. &nbsp;It is even greater because I am also a type I diabetic (on insulin) which slows healing down and makes complications more likely.</p>\n<p>My eyesight is very important to me particularly due to my artistic hobbies like photography. &nbsp;Luckily my right eye is absolutely fine at the moment.</p>\n<p>Anyway the natural anxiety over this has lead me to be quite introspective and think about life in general. &nbsp;I have been thinking back to some of the the things I have learned and how they might have helped me had I known them when I was younger.</p>\n<p>They are in no particular order. &nbsp;I make no apologies for some of them being quite obvious or even the sort of cheesy advice you would read on a greeting card.</p>\n<p>So here they are in no particular order:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Money and your career are important but not that important</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Serbian-Dinar-and-another-Currency-000082274485_Smalla1ad2.jpg\" width=\"839\" height=\"571\"/></p>\n<p>When I was younger I was (like many kids) convinced that having lots of money would bring happiness. &nbsp;Having the latest Nike Air Jordans and most fashionable clothes, gadgets and the like was a matter of not only pride but vane necessity.</p>\n<p>It was only later that I started to realise that whilst money is a necessity for paying bills and the like it is only a tool. &nbsp;Above a certain level of comfort having more money doesn't really equate to being happier. &nbsp;It just equates to being able to have more \"things\" i.e. possessions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Depending on how you get the money it can also lead to a poverty of the more valuable commodity which is time. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>By similar extension whilst your career should be important it should not be the most important thing in your life. &nbsp;No matter what you do you aren't going to be able to buy yourself more time so don't waste it needlessly going after more money or a better position at work. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is a kind of Faustian pact where you get the worse end of the deal. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Time is the truly important commodity and sharing it with others is one of the most valuable uses of it.</h3>\n<h1><br></h1>\n<h1>Following the herd (or shoal) doesn't doesn't pay off</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_16631433_SMALLec951.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>We are all programmed by society and culture to follow what is \"normal\" and ordinary. &nbsp;This is especially true during those early teen years. &nbsp;Even though we pretend to rebel by picking subcultures like goth, emo, metalhead or whatever this is just a thinly veiled surface level of individuality. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>At it's base it is as conformist as anything else and is merely designed to massage our egos whilst still allowing us to be cocooned within the comfort of our own selected \"tribe\".</p>\n<h3>Truly great people, the kind that change the world don't follow herds or tribes or anything else. &nbsp;They set their own destiny and forge their own path. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>They make the world follow them.</p>\n<p>I know what kind of person I would rather be and it isn't one of the sheep.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Follow your own dreams not those of others</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_76511897_SMALL42a71.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>This is related to the idea of ignoring \"herd mentality\". &nbsp;We often have dreams and expectations placed upon us by our family, friends and teachers. &nbsp;I remember once telling one of my teachers that I wanted to be an artist or a film director and being told:</p>\n<h3>\"You are much too clever to waste your life on something like that. &nbsp;You should be a doctor or a lawyer.\"</h3>\n<p>It may seem like a complement but these kind of sentiments can be just as damaging as more obviously disparaging ones because they psychologically close down certain options in our lives. &nbsp;One can be made to feel that doing what we want would be letting our family, friends and educators down so we push those things aside and just do what is expected of us.</p>\n<p>This ultimately leads to dissatisfaction with our work and our lives. &nbsp;It is much harder to change this in your thirties or later and much easier in practical terms to do it when you are in your teen years and choosing your career. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Paradoxically it seems harder in your teens to say no to the psychological pressure even though it is ultimately your choice.</p>\n<h3>Self confidence in your own ability to know what you truly want early one pays off in the long term. &nbsp;Don't live your life for other people.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>People who agree with you all the time aren't helping you</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Better_an_open_enemy_false_friendb2a45.png\" width=\"794\" height=\"403\"/></p>\n<p>We naturally like to associate with people who have similar views to us and seem agreeable to us. &nbsp;This is part of human nature. &nbsp;Unfortunately what many of us don't realise when we are younger is that a good friend needs to be honest with us. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Someone who is always a \"Yes-man\" can actually encourage us to stagnate and reinforce our negative behaviours. &nbsp;It is simply not healthy and it is dishonest. &nbsp;Your best friends are those who tell you the truth and call you out on your bullshit. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly in your work and acedemic life it is important to listen to conflicting opinions. &nbsp;Just reading material that agrees with what you already think prevents you from evolving both from a personal and an intellectual standpoint. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We can see this in modern internet culture where people focus purely on material that agrees with their political or societal opinions. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Ultimately it leads to greater division, polarisation and entrenchment of attitudes.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>There is no shame in changing your opinion</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/chinese-proverb-on-windmilla2b73.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"560\"/></p>\n<p>To some degree people who have very strong opinions may be respected. &nbsp;It is seen as a sign of confidence. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It could also be a sign of inflexibility and inability to change. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I believe now that life is all about change and evolution. &nbsp;If you stop moving you get left behind. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I was younger I would stubbornly hold on to opinions and beliefs as a matter of pride. &nbsp;There was a certain amount of machismo behind sticking to your opinions and not conceding to those of others. &nbsp;To change them would be seen as some sort of humiliation.</p>\n<p>This is a complete fallacy of course. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>To stick to an opinion merely for the sake of not changing is not only foolish it is positively pathological. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Ultimately it means that you do not progress as a person. &nbsp;I now realise there is no shame in changing your position and admitting that you were wrong. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In many ways it is a lot braver because you are sure to get flack from others who are unable to do the same for \"flip-flopping\".</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Cherish your friends and family because you don't know how long you have with them</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Happy-multigeneration-family-walking-in-the-countryside-000073792689_Small8784a.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>I found this out the hard way in my early twenties. &nbsp;A friend of mine (let's call him John) who I had been with throughout Junior school went to a different college from me. &nbsp;This was in a different area of the country. &nbsp;Though we often made plans to get together they would often follow through for logistical reasons.</p>\n<h3>Over time our conversations and meetings became less and less frequent as \"life\" started to get in the way. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>A few years later when I was home from University and I hadn't heard from him in a while I bumped into a mutual friend.</p>\n<p>Nothing in my life had prepared me for what I heard next. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A year earlier John had been involved in a minor road accident whilst riding his motorbike. &nbsp;He had fallen off as a result and had received what seemed at the time like a minor knock to his head. &nbsp;Feeling fine he had decided that he didn't need to go to hospital. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for him, that minor knock on his head had ruptured a small artery in his meninges, resulting in a slow but progressive increase in intracranial pressure. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>A few hours later he literally dropped dead. &nbsp;He was only 21.</h3>\n<p>I felt so much guilt. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This friend had been so close, like a brother to me. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He had died so suddenly and I hadn't even known. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I had so many regrets - maybe if we had gotten together before his death it could somehow have changed things just enough to prevent this from happening? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I kept having such thoughts and I still have them from time to time.</p>\n<h3>I don't think I have every truly gotten over the trauma of this.</h3>\n<p>You assume that the people you care about and love will always be there just because you can't imagine life without them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fact is life is fragile. &nbsp;Nobody knows how long they have to live.</p>\n<p>Life and death happen all around us all the time. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Appreciate and spend time with loved ones whilst you can because you never know when that time will be up, either for you or for them.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Your parents and grandparents were young too</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/Photo-album---photos-of-children-000070298559_Small3feff.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>One of my teachers at school used to say that -</p>\n<h3>\"When you are young you know everything except your own ignorance.\"&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;This is so true. &nbsp;Once we become teenagers we tend to assume we know better than everyone else. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When our parents and grandparents give us valuable advice we tend to ignore it because - what do they know? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We tend to forget that they were once young and had the same kind of hopes and dreams we do. &nbsp;By being further on in their lives and having more experience they can give us a perspective that we lack.</p>\n<p>They are a resource that we ignore at our peril.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Never give up on your hobbies and interests</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/painting-brush53238.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"530\"/></p>\n<p>We all know the saying that \"variety is the spice of life\". &nbsp;We all tend to get pushed for time as we get older and develop more responsibilities. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is very easy to give up on those simple hobbies that gave us so much pleasure when we were younger. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether it was engaging in a particular sport, listening to music, enjoying nature or just travelling we tend to give less importance and priority to these activities.</p>\n<p>These kind of activities are very important for recharging our mental energy and helping us to get away from the worries and concerns of life. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>One could almost consider them to be like a from of activity based meditation.</p>\n<p>I gave up on my art work for many years due to the sheer workload I had during University and then in work. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was a mistake and it was only through being forced to re-enage with it through ill health that I realised how important and fulfilling a part of my life it was and now still is.</p>\n<h1><br></h1>\n<h1>My Final Point: Life is short make sure you actually experience it</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_89191645_SMALL0da25.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>As you get older you start to realise how quickly time passes by. &nbsp;We have a tendency to live in either the past or the future, rarely experiencing the present. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not only does this make time appear to pass more quickly but it also leaves us unable to appreciate what we have at the time only realising it later through the lens of hindsight. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the principles of mindfulness is the idea of recapturing and experiencing the moment. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think we would all do well to follow this idea. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>By reconnecting with our momentary existence we can become more aware of our own thoughts, feelings and what we ultimately want. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>It can also allow us to readjust our focus on what is important and start to concentrate on it more whilst we still have time. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>So many of us simply drift through our lives without the kind of focus this could provide and you don't want to be the person who starts making these kind of observations when it is too late for you to be doing anything with them.</p>\n<h3>You don't want to end up feeling like you were just a passive bystander or a passenger in your own life.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_57565926_SMALLac7bb.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Thanks very much for reading. &nbsp;I hope you found it useful and interesting.</p>\n<h3>Do you have any similar things that you wished you had known when you were younger? Please share in the comments below.</h3>\n<p>This will probably be my last post for a while as I am due to have eye surgery tomorrow and will be recuperating for some days. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If I have time I might put out another post before the operation but if I don't please all take care and I wish you all the best.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>You can find more of my work by following me @thecryptofiend - thanks.</em></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "**Hi everyone!**\n\n*Today I would like to tell you about the most perspective technology of a past ten years, which can change our world and make our life so easier!*\n\n\n----------\n\n\n# What is the Internet of Things\n\nInternet of Things is a new stage of development of the Internet, that significantly enhances the possibility of collecting, analyzing and distributing of data that a person can turn into information and knowledge.\n\n![enter image description here](http://i83.fastpic.ru/big/2016/0831/49/691518dcfaa31e59e3b13ce866f3c549.jpeg)\n\n# Why do we need the Internet of Things\n\nThe ideology of the Internet of things is aimed at enhancing economic efficiency by automating processes in various fields of activity and exclusion of a human from them.\n\nAt the beginning of 2016 the most important concepts are:\n\n1. \"Smart House\"\n2. \"Intelligent Transport\"\n\n![enter image description here](http://i78.fastpic.ru/big/2016/0831/f7/9c955ed4affa905242c631b183fbfdf7.jpg)\n\nMankind has a chance to get rid of phobias, such as \"Have I closed the door\" or \"Have I turned off the iron,\" because this information will be on the smartphone and can be corrected from anywhere in the world. The monitoring system detects the faces of all who passed by your house or stood near the door of the apartment, and when the same person comes again it compares his face with a police database. Just in case. Refrigerator, equipped with a set of cameras will inform about the end of the shelf life of products. The smart cleaner will send a message about the finding of jewelry under the sofa.\n\n\n# How did the Internet of Things appear\n\n\nInternet of Things was born at MIT in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, the population of our planet was about 6.3 billion people and 500 million devices have been connected to the Internet. \n\nIn 2010, as a result of the rapid spread of smartphones and tablet computers, the number of connected devices has increased to 12.5 billion, while the world\u2019s population was 6.8 billion people.\n\n![enter image description here](http://i84.fastpic.ru/big/2016/0831/83/49910ef8ebb8062e47e48892763ed983.jpeg)\n\nThus, the Internet of Things \"was born\" between 2008 and 2009 years.\n\n\n# Internet of Things as a \"network of networks\"\n\nToday, the Internet of things is composed of badly interconnected disparate networks, each of which has been developed for specific needs. For example, today's cars have multiple networks: one controls the operation of the engine, the other - security systems, third provides connection, etc. The office and residential buildings are a set of multiple networks of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, telephone connection, safety, and lighting. With the development of the Internet of things, these and many other networks would be connected to each other and get more opportunities in the field of security, intelligence and control. \n\n\n# The value of the Internet of Things\n\nEven today the Internet of Things has caused widespread of temperature, pressure, vibration, light, humidity and physical activities sensors that help us to anticipate various problems.\n\nThe Internet started being used in previously inaccessible spheres. Patients began to swallow Internet devices to accurately diagnose some diseases and identify their causes. Microscopic sensors connected to the Internet can be attached to the plants, animals, and geological formations. The Internet now is developed even in the open space.\n\n![enter image description here](http://i84.fastpic.ru/big/2016/0831/aa/b541de35fad843d3f4d92b4fbcf888aa.jpeg)\n\n# Development problems\n\nThere are factors that can slow the development of Internet of Things. The most important are the transition to IPv6, the power supply of sensors and the adoption of common standards.\n\n*Deficiency of addresses and the transition to IPv6*\n\nIn February 2010 all IPv4 addresses were already occupied. This fact can significantly slow down the development of the Internet of Things, as billions of new sensors need new and unique IP-addresses. In addition, the IPv6 simplifies network management by using automatic configuration and the new, more effective information security functions.\n\n# Standards\n\nWhile in the field of standards there has been a significant progress, there is a lot of work ahead, especially in such areas as security, protection of personal information, communications and architecture.\n\nBy the beginning of November 2014 several organizations, including Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), which includes Dell, Intel, and Samsung Electronics started the development of universal specifications for \"smart\" electronics and related certification program.\n\n# Power supply of sensors\n\nInternet of Things needs sensors that would operate entirely autonomously. Now imagine what that means: we need billions of batteries for billions of devices installed all over the world and even in space. It is completely unrealistic. \n\nIn 2010, a great success has been achieved in this area. Scientists announced new nanogenerator - a flexible chip that converts human movements into the electricity. \n\n![enter image description here](http://i82.fastpic.ru/big/2016/0831/3a/152763f627dcff00fbfb572222280f3a.jpg)\n\n# Safe IoT ecosystem does not exist\n\nHP research found that about 70% of the analyzed devices do not encrypt wireless traffic. Web-interface of 60% of the devices were considered to be unsafe due to insecure access organization and high-risk of cross-site scripting. Most devices have passwords of insufficient resistance. Approximately 90% of the devices collected personal information of the owner without his knowledge.\nOverall, HP has counted about 25 different vulnerabilities in each of the studied devices (televisions, door locks, household scales, home security systems, electrical outlets ...) and their mobile and cloud components.\nThe conclusion of HP experts was disappointing: safe IoT ecosystem does not exist now.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n*So you see that this is a really useful technology of the future that would completely change our daily life and make it better and more convenient. But it has got some drawbacks that would be fixed in the period of 5-10 years so they are nor fatal.*\n\n[Follow me](steemit.com/@phenom), if you are a geek like me or interested in technologies and scientific/educational topics\n\nAlex",

But equally important, perhaps more so, is scholars\u2019 and translators\u2019 disagreements as to which ancient manuscript to use at the source text for those translations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>As previously alluded, there is no single ancient document that scholars or theologians can identify as the definitive, original source text for any book of the Bible. Instead, translators are left to choose between stunning variety of ancient manuscripts, many of which are incomplete and hopelessly irreconcilable. The preface to the New King James Version of the Bible hints at the true extent of these inconsistencies:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>Since the 1880\u2019s most contemporary translations of the New Testament have relied upon a relatively few manuscripts discovered chiefly in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Such translations depend primarily on two manuscripts, Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus, because of their greater age. The Greek text obtained by using these sources and the related papyri (our most ancient manuscripts) is known as the Alexandrian Text. However, some scholars have grounds for doubting the faithfulness of Vaticanus and Sinaiticus, since they often disagree with one another, and Sinaiticus exhibits excessive omission.</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Codex Sinaiticus is the oldest surviving complete copy of the New Testament. It dates to the mid 4th century CE and is presently housed in the British Library in London. Not only does the Sinaiticus exhibit \u201cexcessive omission\u201d, but it also includes writings that are not represented in our modern New Testaments at all, namely the Epistle of Barnabas and the Sheppard of Hermas. In addition, it is replete with scribal \u201ccorrections\u201d and alterations that scholars have painstakingly catalogued over the years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Another early extant copy of the Bible, which dates to a few decades later than the Sinaiticus, is the Book of Alexandria. Interestingly, it likewise contains writings not found in our modern New Testaments, namely I and II Clement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A third important early copy of the Bible is the Codex Bezae, which dates to the fifth century CE. It varies significantly from other early texts, to the great consternation of many scholars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>After comparing some of these various ancient source texts to the Alexandrian Text discussed above and noting some discrepancies in the ancient documents, the Preface to the New King James Version predictably attempts to minimize the significance of these differences:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>[I]t is most important to emphasize that fully eighty-five percent of the New Testament text is the same in the Textus Receptus, the Alexandrian Text, and the Majority Text.</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3><strong>But how and why we should be comforted by this statement is a mystery, because it explicitly recognizes that the three cited original source texts, which themselves are a synthesis of numerous inconsistent manuscripts (for instance, the Alexandrian Text is a synthesis of the Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, and assorted incomplete fragments of papyri), are inconsistent as to a full fifteen percent of the New Testament! </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3><strong>Bruce M. Metzger, PhD, a noted Bible scholar often cited by Literalists, estimates that there are about twenty four thousand ancient New Testament manuscripts in existence, with tens of thousands of known variations between them (The Case for Christ at 63-64). Professor Bart Ehrman, has pointed out that the number of variations in our surviving source texts exceeds the number of words in the entire New Testament.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>To list but a handful of the \u201cmanuscript differences\u201d one uncovers by reviewing these ancient New Testament source texts, consider the following ten: </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1) Later manuscripts of 1 John 5:7-8 contain a phrase that earlier ones do not. Specifically, later versions say \u201cin heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit\u2026\u201d. This phrase first appears in Miniscule 61, dating to the fifteenth or sixteenth century. The reader can see How We Got the Bible at 100 for an interesting discussion of how this verse came to be included in modern English Bibles, but to make a long story short, it was originally inserted by Literalists to bolster the doctrine of the Trinity. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>2) Later manuscripts of the Gospel of Mark contain an ending that does not appear in the earliest versions of the book. Specifically, Chapter 16:9-20 of Mark, which describes Jesus\u2019 post-resurrection appearances to Mary Magdalene and others, do not appear in the earliest and bests texts, such as the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. Likewise, they do not appear in the oldest known manuscripts of the Latin Vulgate or Old Syriac. The vocabulary used in these verses is highly suspect and generally does not fit with Mark\u2019s style. Furthermore, many expressions found in them appear nowhere else in the entire New Testament. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Because all of our earliest versions of Mark simply end his account with the discovery of the empty tomb (Chapter 16, verse 8), we can be assured that the expanded ending placed in our modern Bible is almost certainly inauthentic. After all, consider which is more likely: (a) Early orthodox Christians (who argued vehemently that Christ physically resurrected \u201cin the flesh\u201d and who were the keepers of the Bible for centuries) inexplicably deleted Mark\u2019s original account of Jesus\u2019 post-resurrection appearances before compiling our most ancient texts and destroyed all older versions, thus accounting for its absence in our earliest manuscripts; or (2) these same orthodox Christians intentionally added references of Jesus\u2019 post-resurrection to the end Mark to support their argument that he rose in the flesh and inadvertently failed to destroy all older versions. If we are to be fair, the second explanation is far more likely. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>3) In Mark 1:1, many of the oldest manuscripts do not include Jesus\u2019 title as \u201cSon of God.\u201d This \u201cdivine\u201d title was added by the church to bolster its claim of Jesus\u2019 divinity. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>4) The oldest and best manuscripts mistakenly attribute the Old Testament quote in Mark 1:2 to Isaiah rather than to Malachi. Later scribes corrected this obvious error by altering the text to attribute the subsequent quotes simply to \u201cthe Prophets.\u201d </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>5) Mark 11:26 does not appear at all in many ancient texts. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>6) Mark 15:28 does not appear in many ancient texts.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>7) Part of Luke 22:19 and all of Luke 22:20 do not appear in some ancient manuscripts.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>8) The oldest manuscripts do not contain John 8:1-11, which records the only gospel account of the woman caught in adultery, and Jesus\u2019 famous statement to \u201clet he who is without sin cast the first stone\u201d. About a dozen of the ancient manuscripts (the \u201cFamily 13\u201d miniscules dating to the ninth century) peculiarly place the story of the adulterous woman not in the gospel of John, but after Luke 21:38. However, based on the historical record, scholars are quite certain that this story was never part of John\u2019s or Luke\u2019s \u201coriginal\u201d account. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>9) The oldest manuscripts do not contain Acts 9:37, in which Phillip apparently requires a eunuch to profess a certain \u201cbelief\u201d that \u201cJesus Christ is the Son of God\u201d prior to being baptized with water. The eunuch\u2019s confession of faith appears for the first time in the Codex Laudianus, which is dated to the sixth century. This spurious addition was inserted long after Acts was written, likely in an effort to bolster the orthodox position that specific \u201cbeliefs\u201d were required in order to receive baptism and be saved.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>10) Matthew 23:14 is not found in the earliest manuscripts.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>And the Older Copies Weren't Really Any Better</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>One may be tempted to think that the early Church Fathers must surely have had \"truer\", uncorrupted copies of these books, copies that we may one day unearth or recreate through the aid of textual criticism. But if this is true at all, it is only marginally true. Even as early as the third century the church father Origen lamented: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>The difference among the manuscripts have become great, either through the negligence of some copyists or through the perverse audacity of others; they either neglect to check over what they have transcribed, or, in the process of checking, they make additions or deletions as they please.</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And, the so-called Father of Church History, Eusebius (c. 300) quotes the Bishop of Corinth, Dionysius, as similarly lamenting: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>When my fellow-Christians invited me to write letter to them I did so. These the devils apostles have filled with tares, taking away some things and adding others.... Small wonder then if some have dared to tamper even with the word of the Lord Himself, when they ahve conspired to mutilate my own humble efforts.</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>Literalists Attempt to Rationalize Away the Problem</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>While Literalists are quick to point out that most of the manuscript differences among the source documents are relatively \u201cminor\u201d in nature, and they attribute many of them to errors in transcription by the scribes charged with making copies of the sacred documents, their mere existence is troubling.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Even if all discrepancies resulted from scribal errors of a minor nature, they still provide incontrovertible proof that human error has corrupted what Literalist often argue is \u201cGod\u2019s infallible Word.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, having conceded that its possible for humans to have \u201cinadvertently\u201d altered God\u2019s word, if only in minor ways (they assure us), it seems to me that Literalists should have a hard time explaining why humans, especially ideologically motivated humans with a known propensity for forgery (like the early Literalist Christians) could not have also intentionally altered God\u2019s word in material ways to suit their purposes. Said another way, why would God have permitted his Word to be corruptible by human error, but not by human intent? If it is corruptible at all, it is surely corruptible by both. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Despite the self-evident sensibleness of this contention, \"faithful\" Literalists have historically attempted to argue the contrary. Daniel Whitby, a prominent, Literalist theologian of the early 1700's, was one of them: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>Whitby['s]...basic view was that even though God certainly would not prevent errors from creeping into scribal copies of the New Testament, at the same time he would never allow the text to be corrupted (i.e., altered) to the point that it could not adequately achieve its divine aim and purpose. (Ehrman, Misquoting Jesus at 85)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And yet, after being confronted with a the work of John Mill, a fellow of Queen's College who spent the better part of his life analyzing surviving Greek manuscripts (cataloging more than thirty thousand textual variations among them), even Whitby was forced to admit: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>I GRIEVE therefore and am vexed that I have found so much in Mill's Prolegomena which seems quite plainly to render the standard of faith [referred to as the \"rule of faith\" above and which, as the reader will recall was the method by which the orthodox distinguished \"authentic\" texts from forgeries when compiling the Bible] insecure, or at best to give others too good a handle for doubting. (quoted in Misquoting Jesus at 85)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Thus, if our modern Bibles are, as Literalists would have us believe, the infallible Word of God (at least in all material respects), they are so not because God has protected them over the centuries from human corruption, for the existence of manuscript differences and errors in translation is undeniable. Rather, if they are infallible, they are so only because the keepers of the Bible over the centuries have not made any material human mistakes in transcription or translation, nor have they intentionally perverted it in any meaningful way. And yet, like Whitby at his most honest, any fair contemplation of the evidence shows that this is not the case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>Not All Variances are Errors</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>It simply cannot be seriously maintained that all the known manuscript discrepancies in our Bibles were unintentional and immaterial. The most important of these differences, the additions that appear in later manuscripts which do not appear in earlier versions, can be directly traced to on-going and well-known debates within the early church on various theological issues, and perhaps not surprisingly, virtually all of these edits tend to bolster the orthodox, Literalist\u2019s arguments.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>This tendency to add orthodox teachings to scripture is too consistent throughout the centuries to be merely the result of random scribal errors. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the doctrine of the Trinity was not an explicitly stated theological concept when the earliest manuscripts were written, and it was the subject of much heated debate as late as the 4th century CE (and actually much, much beyond that, as any moder day Unitarian would tell you). That later manuscripts contain Trinitarian words or phrases which are not found in the earliest versions of those same manuscripts is compelling evidence of intentional revision by orthodox editors, not simply scribal error.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Even Bible scholars frequently cited by Literalists have had to admit this fact: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>I think that these words [concerning the Trinity in 1 John 5:7-8] are found in only about seven or eight [source] copies, all from the fifteenth or sixteenth century. I acknowledge that this is not part of what the author of 1 John was inspired to write. (Lee Strobel, The Case For Christ at 65, quoting Bruce M. Metzger, PhD)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The insertion of Jesus\u2019 title as Son of God in later versions of Mark 1:1 provides a second example of a spurious and intentional addition. Jesus\u2019 exact nature continued to be debated into the Fourth Century, with many Christians viewing him as having been purely human, others as purely God, and yet others as both. Those who viewed him as in some manner divine ultimately won the day. That his \u201cdivine\u201d title as \u201cSon of God\u201d appears in later versions of Mark 1:1, but not in earlier ones, again reveals the hand of editors intent on bolstering their theological case, and perhaps on harmonizing the Gospels. (As a side note, \"Son of God\" was not considered a divine title at all to Jews, as evidenced by various Old Testament personalities who, like Jesus, were called such. However, Greek culture, thanks to various pagan religious myths, did consider the \"sons of God\" to be divine.) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A third example is Paul\u2019s supposed directives for women to be silent in church, found in 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 and 1 Timothy 2:12-15. 1 Timothy is a known forgery designed to, among many other things, advance anti-Gnostic, orthodox, misogynist views which were certainly not Paul\u2019s own, so we will consider it no further. But what about 1 Corinthians, which scholars almost universally agree was indeed originally written by Paul? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>There are good reasons for thinking Paul did not write the passage about women being silent in chapter 14 [of 1 Corinthians]. For one thing, just three chapters earlier Paul condoned the practice of women speaking in church. They are to have their heads covered, he insists, when they pray and prophecy [teach]\u2014activities done out loud in antiquity. How could Paul condone a practice (women speaking in church) in chapter 11 that he condemns in chapter 14?</strong></em> <em><strong>It has often been noted that the passage in chapter 14 also appears intrusive in its own literary context: Both before and after his instructions for women to keep silent, Paul is speaking not about women in church but about prophets [i.e., teachers] in church. When the verses on women are removed, the passage flows neatly without a break. This too suggests that these verses were inserted into the passage later.&nbsp;</strong></em></blockquote>\n<blockquote><em><strong>Moreover, it is striking that the verses in question appear in different locations in some of our surviving manuscripts of Paul\u2019s letter as if they had originally appeared as a marginal note (drawn from the teaching of the forged letter of 1 Timothy?) and inserted as judged appropriate in different parts of the chapter. On these grounds, a number of scholars have concluded that Paul\u2019s instructions for women to be silent in 1 Corinthians may not be from Paul, just as the letter to Timothy is not from Paul. </strong></em>&nbsp;<em><strong>What, then, was Paul\u2019s attitude toward women in the church? In his undisputed letters, Paul indicates that \u201cin Christ there is no male or female\u201d (Gal 3:28), that is, that men and women were completely equal in Christ.&nbsp;</strong></em></blockquote>\n<blockquote><em><strong>Moreover, as scholars of the late twentieth century began to emphasize, churches connected in some way with Paul appear to have had women leaders. Just in the greetings to the church of Rome, for example, Paul mentions several women who worked with him as Christian missionaries (Rom 16:3,6, 12), another who was the patron of the church meeting in her home (16:3), one other, a woman named Phoebe, who was a deacon in the church of Cenchrea (16:1), and most striking of all, yet another women, Junia, whom Paul describes as \u201cforemost among the apostles\u201d (16:7). (Ehrman, cite forthcoming)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This last comment by Paul, where he acknowledges that women were included among the apostles, was so difficult for orthodox translators (many of whom were staunch misogynists as we shall see) to stomach that, until recently, translations simply changed the name of the person in question to \"Junias\", presumably a man's name. But: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>[W]hereas Junia was a common name for a woman, there is no evidence in the ancient world for \"Junias\" as a man's name. Paul is referring to a woman named Junia, even though in some modern English Bibles (you may want to check your own!) translators continue to refer to this female apostle as if she were a man name Junias. (Ehrman, Misquoting Jesus at 18)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Yet, another example of intentional revision occurs in Luke 2:33. Originally this verse said, \u201cAnd His [i.e., Jesus\u2019] father and mother marveled at what was said about Him\u201d, suggesting that Jesus\u2019 father was Joseph, which could not be if Jesus were born of a virgin. Consequently, Literalist scribes altered later versions of the manuscripts to read, \u201cJoseph and his mother marveled at what was said about him\u201d, thereby preventing anyone from interpreting Luke as suggesting that Joseph was Jesus\u2019 father. The altered version is the one that is preserved for us today in King James Version of our Bibles, although the New American Standard and New International Versions are among those that properly render the phrase as it was originally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Orthodox editors also made revisions to Luke 3:22 to counteract the claim by some early Christians that Jesus was not truly divine until he was \u201cadopted\u201d by God at his baptism. This theory, known as adoptionism, was popular among certain early Christian groups and, at least originally, had biblical support. For example, the oldest surviving source texts of Luke 3:22 quotes God as saying from the clouds at Jesus\u2019 baptism, \u201cYou are my son, today I have begotten you\u201d, which is a paraphrase of Psalm 2:7. However, orthodox scribes, who opposed the adoptionist theory, were naturally uncomfortable with a quote from God suggesting that Jesus was not begotten of God until the day of his baptism, especially when such language was different from that offered in Mark\u2019s and Matthew\u2019s accounts of Jesus\u2019 baptism, and directly contradicted John\u2019s account of Jesus\u2019 pre-existent divinity! </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>So, was Jesus begotten of God before his birth, as suggested in the opening chapter of John, or only after his baptism, as taught by the authentic Luke, or only upon his resurrection as taught by Paul? All of these inconsistencies were too much for Literalist orthodox editors to bear. To prevent the faithful from being \u201cmisled\u201d, Literalist scribes and translators simply altered Luke 3:22 to read, \u201cYou are my beloved Son; in You I am well pleased\u201d, an apparent illusion to Isaiah 42. This alteration had the three-fold benefit of preventing an adoptionist interpretation, harmonizing Luke\u2019s account of God\u2019s words with the accounts of Mark and Matthew, and linking Jesus to Isaiah and his prophecies.<strong> Perhaps it is for these reasons that the altered version survives to this day in virtually every modern translation of the New Testament (though the authentic reading is sometimes footnoted). </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>In another striking example of orthodox alterations, a whole scene was inserted into Luke to counteract the docetic \u201cheresy\u201d, or the teaching that Jesus didn\u2019t actually suffer during his passion due to his divine nature. The scene in question is the famous episode where Jesus, distressed over his impending fate, \"sweats blood\" in the Garden of Gethsemane. Luke 22:43-44 describes the scene as follows: </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening him. And being in great agony, he prayed more earnestly. Then his sweat became like great drops of blood falling to the ground.</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>As dramatic and memorable as this scene is, it appears only in later versions of the Gospel of Luke! It does not appear in the earliest and most reliable versions of Luke and is absent from Matthew, Mark, and John altogether. Although it is an obvious and spurious addition, it is preserved even in our modern Bibles (though again, some translations provide the authentic reading via footnote). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>One final example of Gospel alterations can be seen in their rather disingenuous anti-Semitism. It is exceedingly unlikely that the anti-Jewish sentiments expressed in the Gospels were written by first century Jews. It\u2019s presence within them strongly suggests the influence of pro-Roman, non-jewish editors who, after the fact, offered up the Jews as scapegoats for the actions of the Roman authorities. As Professor Eisenman has noted: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>It should be categorically stated\u2026that a Jewish document can be sectarian, that is, anti-Pharisee or even anti-Sadducee, as the Dead Sea Scrolls most certainly are and the Gospels at their most authentic sometimes are, but it cannot be anti-Semitic. This would be a contradiction in terms. (James The Brother of Jesus at 59)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In this respect, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>[I]t is an illuminating exercise to trace the treatment of Pilate [the Roman Governor] through our surviving Gospels. The more he is excused, the more the Jews are blamed. Our earliest account, Mark, shows Pilate and the Jewish people reaching a kind of agreement to have Jesus crucified. Pilate then orders it, and Jesus is taken off immediately to his death (Mark 15:1-15). In Matthew\u2019s Gospel, written somewhat later, Pilate is warned by his wife, who has had a bad dream, not to be involved in the affair; Pilate then shows that he wants nothing to do with Jesus\u2019 death by washing his hand of the business. \u201cI am innocent of this man\u2019s blood. See to it yourselves,\u201d he declares. The Jewish crowd then responds, \u201cHis blood be on us and our children\u201d (Matt 27:25), a response doomed to wreak havoc in the hands of Christian persecutors of Jews throughout the Middle Ages. </strong></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote><em><strong>In Luke\u2019s Gospel, written about the same time as Matthew, Pilate declares Jesus innocent three times, to no avail, and tries to arrange for King Herod, in town for the Passover Feast, to do the dirty work for him. But again it is to no avail. With little way out, Pilate yields to the demands of the Jewish leaders and orders Jesus crucified (Luke 23:1-15). In John\u2019s Gospel, the final canonical account to be written, Pilate again declares Jesus innocent three times, and then finally, when his hand is forced, turns Jesus over\u2014not, however to the Roman soldiers but to the Jewish people. Jesus is then crucified. (John 18:28\u201419:16) (Ehrman, Lost Christianities at 21)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Thus, as time passed, the Gospels reflected ever increasing levels of hostility toward the Jews, and accommodation toward the Romans. This is exactly what we\u2019d expect to see: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>[The Jewish historian] Josephus notes that all historical works form this period suffer from two main defects, \u201cflattery of the Romans and vilification of the Jews, adulation and abuse being substituted for the real historical record.\u201d (James the Brother of Jesus at xxii)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In short, no document that offended Rome, not even the Bible, could long persist in the ancient world. Rome was brutal in its suppression of dissent, especially in persistent trouble spots like the land of the Jews. Furthermore, once Rome became Christianity\u2019s sponsor in the time of Constantine, both Rome and the Church had every motivation to obscure the former\u2019s role in Jesus\u2019 death by offering up the troublesome Jews as scapegoats. Therefore, to the extent the Gospels vilify the Jews en masse (such as when the Jews amazingly and disingenuously cry out for the blood of Jesus to be on their heads and the heads of their children), and flatter the Romans in unbelievable ways (such as when the notoriously brutal and despised Pontius Pilate repeatedly declares Jesus\u2019 innocence and is made to wash his hands of Jesus\u2019 blood), we have evidence of late, non-Jewish editing of the Gospels. It should be remembered that most all the orthodox Church Fathers who selected and edited our Bibles were not Jews, and after Constantine many owed their livelihood to Rome. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>Hidden in Plain Sight</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>One might wonder how it is that orthodox leaders could have expected to hide all these inconsistencies for so long. In this respect, we must remember that, after the fourth century, the laity was not permitted to read the Bible directly, but rather had it read to them by priests. For centuries, Priests could simply choose to read those portions of the Bible that advanced the Literalist, orthodox agenda (such as the spurious addition of \u201cPaul\u2019s\u201d prohibition against women speaking in church), while failing to read contradictory passages, such as Paul\u2019s statement of equality in 1 Corinthians 12. Having no access to Bible\u2019s themselves, much less earlier versions of the work to serve as a basis for comparison, the laity never knew the difference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>Have We Found All the Alterations?</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In cataloging some of the known alterations and revisions to the Bible above, I have mentioned only a few of the more significant ones that persist in our modern Bibles. But, in addition to these, scholars have also identified numerous historical alterations which are mostly invisible to the modern reader because they have since been corrected via updated translations and modern revisions of older ones. So, even if our modern Bible\u2019s could by some miracle be deemed infallible, it is indisputable that centuries upon centuries of earlier Christians, the one's who developed our familiar Christian dogma, were denied this same benefit. And yet, we are to believe that the Atonement Theology that they developed by reading these faulty texts is nonetheless correct. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Can one be certain that scholars have catalogued all theologically-motivated alterations to scripture? Certainly not. We know that orthodox Christians intentionally altered the New Testament text to suit their agenda, we just don\u2019t know how much they did so. The reason is that:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>We don\u2019t have \u201coriginals\u201d of any of the books that came to be included in the New Testatment, or indeed of any Christian book from antiquity. What we have are copies of the originals or, to be more accurate, copies made from copies of the copies of the copies of the copies of the originals. (Ehrman, Lost Christianities at 217).</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>In short, given the extensiveness and importance of the theologically motivated alterations that have been detected, given that we don\u2019t have anything close to the originals to examine, and given that those surviving New Testament texts that we do have were all compiled and translated by orthodox Literalists, there is no way to be sure that our Bibles don\u2019t contain significant additional alterations which defy detection. Indeed, it seems exceedingly likely that they do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>Additional Literalist Rationalizations</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Literalist Christians argue that we should dismiss all these alterations, revisions, additions and edits to the Bible as \u201cimmaterial.\u201d They are immaterial, they argue, because they simply confirm the truth of whatever particular Literalist doctrine the additions support. In other words, Literalists argue that because what the additions say is true anyway, we shouldn\u2019t worry about them. An alteration supporting the Trinity is immaterial because the Trinity is true. An alteration suggesting Jesus suffered is immaterial because Jesus did suffer. An alteration supporting the notion that Jesus was divine at birth is immaterial because Jesus was divine at birth. \u201cNo harm, no foul\u201d is the rationale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>However, this argument ignores the fact that many, even most, Literalist doctrines were not accepted as \u201ctruth\u201d by a large portion of the earliest Christians, and very likely wouldn\u2019t be accepted as such today but for the Literalists\u2019 ultimate victory and recasting of the scriptures: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>[I]f some other form of Christianity had won the early struggles for dominance, the familiar doctrines of Christianity might never have become the \u201cstandard\u201d belief of millions of people\u2026. The New Testament as a collection of sacred books might never have come into being. Or it might have come into being with an entirely different set of books\u2026. (Ehrman, Lost Christianities at 6)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>The \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d rationale proffered by Literalists also ignores the fact that many of these alterations also serve the purpose of reconciling discrepancies among the Gospels, making them appear to bear witness to the same facts or \u201ctruths\u201d when they often don\u2019t. In other words, read in the original tongue, the doctrinal positions of the Literalists are not self-evidently true.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>For example, as we have seen, in its authentic form, Luke\u2019s account of Jesus\u2019 baptism suggests that Jesus was not begotten of God until the day he was baptized! This directly contradicts other biblical accounts, which suggest that Jesus was divine at birth, or even before birth, or only upon his resurrection. By altering Luke\u2019s account of the words spoken by God at Jesus\u2019 baptism so as to harmonize them with the other gospel accounts, scribes made sure that the orthodox view of Jesus\u2019 divinity was emphasized in our modern Bibles, and also disguised an obvious contradiction in what is supposed to be God\u2019s infallible word.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>If the orthodox didn\u2019t hesitate to alter the actual words of God quoted in the scriptures, then there\u2019s no reason to believe that they would think twice about altering, for example, Paul\u2019s letters. I will have much more on this later. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Finally, given the tendency of Literalists to construct entire theological concepts from only one or two Bible verses, any alteration to God\u2019s Word must be considered material and spurious. For example, the Literalist Christian theological doctrines of the Rapture, the Trinity, Original Sin, Jewish responsibility for Jesus\u2019 death, and the subservient status of women (just to name a few) find New Testament support in only a handful of verses oft cited by Literalist. If some or all of these verses are spurious, then these theological concepts are themselves questionable at best and fraudulent at worst. Any alteration to a supposedly infallible, God-inspired document must be considered substantive, meaningful, and unacceptable, Literalist justifications notwithstanding. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Educated Literalists who are aware of the above problems with their position sometimes resort to arguing that, biblical alternations not withstanding, the very survival of their faith is evidence of its authenticity: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>Why of all first-century figures, including the Roman emperors, is Jesus still worshiped today, while the others have crumbled in to the dust of history? It\u2019s because this Jesus--the historical Jesus\u2014is also the living Lord. That\u2019s why. It\u2019s because he\u2019s still around, while the others are long gone. (Ben Witherington, III, PhD quoted in The Case for Christ at 141)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Elaine Pagels sum up this particular Literalist argument beautifully: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>Traditionally, Christian theologians have declared that \u201cthe Holy Spirit guides the church into all truth\u201d\u2014a statement often taken to mean that what has survived must be right. Some historians of religion have rationalized this conviction by implying that in Christian history, as in the history of science, weak, false ideas die off early, while the strong and valid ones survive. The late Raymond Brown, a prominent New Testament scholar and Roman Catholic Sulpican priest, stated this perspective baldly: What orthodox [Literalist] Christians rejected was only \u201cthe rubbish of the second century\u201d\u2014and he added, \u201cit\u2019s still rubbish.\u201d ( Pagels, Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas at 76-77)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But, the flaws in these \u201csurvival of the truest\u201d arguments should be apparent to all. First, if indeed the Holy Spirit guides the decisions of the church \u201cinto all truth\u201d, how do we explain the mistakes that churches of all denominations and persuasions throughout the centuries have made and now acknowledge? In the Catholic tradition, Crusades, witch hunts, inquisitions, corruption, Papal incest, the peddling of indulgences, and outright purchase of the throne of St. Peter are all documented facts of church history. To name a few more specific examples of Church mistakes, the Catholic Church burned Joan of Arc at the stake for heresy, only to name her a Saint some 500 years later. In 591 CE, the Vatican, via Pope Gregory the Great, declared that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute, only to recant this teaching more than one thousand years later, in 1969. In the 16th Century, Pope Paul the 4th banished the Jews of Rome to live in a ghetto, where they were confined from sunset to sunrise, and the Middle Ages are replete with examples of church-sponsored persecution of Jews, including the Spanish Inquisition. It was not until this century that Pope John Paul II finally acknowledged how misguided the Catholic Church had been in persecuting the Jews, apologizing for it publicly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The history of Protestant Churches is likewise riddled with mistakes which they now only reluctantly acknowledge--the Salem Witch Hunts, support of slavery, and collaboration with murdering dictators just to name three. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this, how can anyone seriously assert that the \u201cHoly Spirit guides the church into all truth\u201d or, if it does, that the Church has at all relevant times been guided by the Holy Spirit? More specifically, are we to believe that the Church was temporarily misguided when it did the horrible things noted above for which it later apologized, but was perfectly guided when it designated some Christian writings as canonical (biblical) while brutally suppressing those Christian writings that it deemed \u201cheretical\u201d? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Second, the Literalist contention that in the marketplace of ideas truth ultimately prevails, is likewise unpersuasive. Even if we accept the doubtful premise that, if ideas are permitted to compete for the heart and sole of humanity, true ones generally become accepted over time while false ones fall away, the same cannot be said where coercive and suppressive techniques such as those discussed above, and many more that will be detailed below, are used to prevent the competition of ideas in the first place! For anyone to now assert that, after a fifteen hundred year history of propaganda and suppression of so-called heresy through book-burnings, inquisitions, forgeries, torture, burnings at the stake, misleading translations, and brain-washing on a massive scale, we are to accept the Literalist Church\u2019s present-day existence as evidence of the truthfulness of its message is simply absurd.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Third, Buddhism and Hinduism are both older than Christianity and have, by comparison, almost no history of coersive proselytizing, yet their membership rivals that of all Literalist Christian churches combined. If the Literalist \u201csurvival of the truest\u201d argument is to be accepted, then these religions must share the title, but I don\u2019t know many Literalist who would willingly concede this point. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And finally, the idea that the \u201cheretical\u201d ideas of the past have not survived to the present, while those of Literalist Christianity have, is simply a false premise to begin with. Although, the \u201cheretical\u201d spiritual ideas of our Christian ancestors do not exist today in any large-scale, institutionalized form (except perhaps in secret societies that developed during the time they were actively suppressed), they nonetheless have persisted to the present as evidenced by the popularity of so-called \u201cNew Age\u201d spirituality, which has much in common with the Gnostic and pagan ideas that were suppressed for centuries. Even many of our most popular movies--such as The Matrix and the Star Wars series, just to name two\u2014are replete with Gnostic ideas. Indeed, these ancient, \u201cheretical\u201d teachings have survived every century\u2019s attempts at repression: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>In all periods of the world\u2019s history, and in every part of the globe, secret orders and societies have existed outside the limits of the official churches for the purpose of teaching what are called \u201cthe Mysteries\u201d: for imparting to suitable and prepared minds certain truths of human life, certain instructions about divine things,\u2026about human nature and human destiny\u2026. </strong></em>&nbsp;<em><strong>***</strong></em> <em><strong>[B]ehind all the official religious systems of the world, and behind all the great moral movements and developments in the history of humanity, have stood what St. Paul called the keepers or \u201cstewards of the Mysteries\u201d [1 Corinthians 4:1]. From that source Christianity itself came into the world. From them originated the great school of Kabalism, that marvelous system of secret, oral tradition of the Hebrews, a strong element of which has been introduced into [the] Masonic system. From them, too, also issued many fraternities and orders, such for instance, as the great orders of Chivalry and of the Rosicrucians, and the school of spiritual alchemy. Lastly, from them too also issued, in the seventeenth century, modern speculative Freemasonry. (W.L. Wilmshurst, The Meaning of Masonry at 22-23.)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>If \u201csurvival\u201d is the test of truthfulness, the \u201cheretical\u201d ideas of our Gnostic ancestors have at least equal claim to the \u201corthodox\u201d idea of our Literalist ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>To conclude this chapter, we have seen how the battles for Christianity shaped our New Testament. To quote Professor Ehrman: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>[T]hese confrontations were waged largely on literary grounds, as members of the proto-orthodox group produced polemical tractates in opposition to other Christian perspectives, forged sacred texts to provide authorizations for their own perspectives (forgeries, that is, claiming to be written by Jesus\u2019 own apostles), and collected other early writings into a sacred canon of Scripture to advance their views and counteract the views of others. It is out of these conflicts that the New Testament came into being, a collection of twenty-seven books taken to be sacred, inspired, and authoritative. (Ehrman, Lost Christianities at 7)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Even so, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>[W]hen we talk about the \u201cfinal\u201d version of the New Testament, we are doing so in (mental) quotation marks, for there never has been complete agreement on the canon throughout the Christian world. (Ehrman, Lost Christianities at 231)</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>What Literalists today consider the divine, infallible Word of God is indisputably a compilation of various inconsistent source texts that have, at best, been subjected to the unconscious biases of translators throughout the ages and, at worst, have been intentionally altered and relentlessly edited to serve the objectives of those in power, namely orthodox Literalists. As one Christian scholar has noted:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote><em><strong>Our modern Greek text [from which our modern English translations are derived] may be described as a reconstructed or restored text. Only two alternatives are available if we seek to print a Greek text. Either we can select one manuscript and make it the standard text, or we can consult a number of manuscripts and authorities and by comparison reconstruct a text which we feel is like the original. If we choose the former course, we are destined to failure, for no one manuscript is free from obvious scribal errors. If we choose the latter course, we will be assured of getting much closer to the original New Testament autographs. For this reason the latter course has always been followed in the printing of the Greek New Testament. This means that our modern text is an edition of the New Testament text restored through all the aids of textual criticism. (How We Got the Bible at 104).</strong></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Thus, if there ever was an infallible version of the Bible, it is undoubtedly lost to us today, and has been lost for almost two thousand years. No fair-mined, rational, and knowledgeable person can conclude otherwise. <strong>We have no Gnostic Bible\u2019s today only because the orthodox Literalists were the one\u2019s who compiled our Bibles, suppressing all other scriptures and disguising the Gnostic ideas in those they retained. How Literalist gained their power over the Bible is the subject of the next chapter.</strong> &nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

The search results are way better than last time I looked.\n\nYesterday, I did a search on @dwinblood and I scrolled through it.    I actually found some posts people had mentioned me or thanked me that I never saw before.    This is pretty useful.     I know he is working closely with @fabian on some **jsnode** updates and that this code base is primarily his own rather than using any source from steemit.com.\n\n**NOTE**: See how one of those posts was by ***steemswede*** and not me?   That is useful to me.\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YV7OikZ.png\"/>\n\n*I have never posted to promote another person's post before*.    In this case though I know he is funding this project using proceeds from steemit and that he has contracted others to assist.\n\nI know he has big plans and I'd love to see them work out.     \n\n<h1>If you haven't done so...</h1>\n\nVisit <a href=\"http://steemshovel.com/index.html\">steemshovel.com</a> and give it a try.\n\nThen if you liked it consider visiting <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemshovel/@kaptainkrayola/steemshovel-com-update-08-30-2016-improved-search-results\">his most recent post</a> and giving it an up vote so he has further funding and incentive to keep on developing.\n\n\n<h1>Please note</h1>\nIf you up vote my post I will send him the SBD as I feel bad.   I didn't want attention to my post.   I wanted attention to his.\n\nIf you comment and ask questions (preferably on his) then he will answer the questions and he's told me he'd put together a post to answer those questions and share plans as relates to the things people talk about.\n\nHe is a capable developer, yet developing in a vacuum is tricky.   He needs your feedback.",

For anyone flagging this post, please consider reading the article linked below, where @fyrstikken slanders @stellabelle with an entirely fictional account of her pumping up Synereo/AMP. Nearly every word of this **comic** is taken from @fyrstikken's own mouth/keyboard and those words were originally directed at myself, @stellabella and the \"minnows\".\n\n*Today we take a detour in Steemocracy Land and venture down Drama Lane. Everything in today's episode was inspired by actual events and mostly actual comments from https://steemit.com/synereo/@fyrstikken/why-on-earth-would-i-chose-synereo-over-steemit-synereo-does-not-even-exist. I hope you get a kick out of it as much as I did. =)*\n\n***\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/lcxgevlb1/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_1.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/hbbrvh3ml/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_2.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/rwvn7h9y5/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_3.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/9txz2iopp/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_4.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/n9pl5pml9/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_5.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/izaxa4hi5/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_6.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/l2lchshb1/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_7.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/gffag0ty5/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_8.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/6gubtjkil/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_9.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/50itbehlp/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_10.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/7gkmp8zod/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_11.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/61nne9nz1/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_12.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/gzpq4yxst/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_13.png\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/50nep56zh/Steemocracy_Volume_12_Scene_14.png\n\n\n***\n***BTW, I'm still waiting for those damn puppets to explain, \"like a child\", what the Hell all of that was about.

When we enter this wonderful world of blockchains, we bring with us our expectations of security and safety. It's natural. \n\nYet Steemit is being marketed quite fervently to people on other centralized social media sites, to entice them with you \"We pay you to blog\". People are use to the Facebook experience, the Twitter experience, or their own personal blogs that are a palimpsest. A palimpset is a manuscript or document in which the original writing or drawing has been effaced, through scratching or chemical removal, to make room for later writing but of which traces remain.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Codex_ephremi.jpg\n\nThink of it as a chalkboard. This word harkens back to a day when writing material was scarce and hard to produce.\nYour new users are coming from a chalkboard world where it is easy to edit, delete, and start again. \n\nSteemit has been a wonderful introduction into decentralized  systems for me. I was unaware of the potential for good and the potential for harm upon joining the site. No where in my introduction did it explain that what I wrote would be indelibly inscribed upon the block-chain. That there is no delete, no edit button. No one to ban a user who's harassing me. \n\nWhile the freedom that comes with this technology is liberating for some, it may not be a good fit for a lot of adapters. \n\n@smooth joined us in steemit.chat and cast much light on the subject for me. It was an awakening experience when they laid it out pure and simple. No one will protect you here so you have to protect yourself. \n\nMe in my naivety, fresh off the programming of a centralized existence. I railed against this answer, as if maybe they hadn't properly understood what I was proposing (censorship, moderation, etc). Their frank honesty was freshing as they explained \"look, it's not that I don't care, I do care, it's simply an inherent part of this system.\" \n\nThis flies in the face of expectation. New users should be met with a big red warning box upon setting up their account, or upon hitting 'post' about the rules of this new game. It's an alien concept to some of us. \n\nEnticing, but also dangerous if not fully consented to. I urge the devs to consider such a 'declaration' of Steemit's inherent differences to other social media sites somewhere in the account creation. Make it clear and legible. I urge everyone who's marketing for Steemit to make sure you mention these inherent traits to your audience.  \n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Transparency.jpg\n\nIf transparency is law, then we should do everything in our power to make the inherent dangers of Steemit as transparent as possible as well.\n\n*images from http://www.texample.net/ and wikipedia*",

Well, as we shall come to see, it didn\u2019t. But, to the extent that some modern Literalists believe that there is a single agreed-upon, infallible book of scripture, it is due, in their view, to the concept of \u201cdivine inspiration\u201d\u2014the idea that God\u2019s hand directed both the writing and the compilation of the Bible over hundreds of years.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But, is this idea of divine inspiration a reasonable one? As suggested in the prior chapter, if God had intended for us to look to a history book for our spiritual salvation, he certainly should have, dare I say would have, made his intentions plainer, no? As Professor Ehrman notes:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It is one thing for believers to affirm, on theological grounds, that the decisions about the canon, like the books themselves, were divinely inspired, but it is another thing to look at the actual history of the process and to ponder the long, drawn-out arguments over which books to include and which to reject. The process did not take a few months or years. It took centuries. And even then there was no unanimity. (Lost Christianities at 230)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Because few lay Christians have ever done so, let\u2019s examine this drawn-out process in more detail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>The Gospels</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Much of the early arguments over the Bible centered upon which gospels should be included, and which excluded, from the New Testament. After all, as previously noted, there were far more gospels in circulation than merely the four known to our Bibles today:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>The greatest difficulty was in choosing the Gospels, and after much controversy, four were chosen: three, those of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are synopses of Jesus\u2019 life, while John\u2019s Gospel concentrates on a few specific miracles performed by Christ. (Solomon J. Schepps, Foreward to the 1979 edition of Lost Books of the Bible at 9)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Limiting the Gospels to only four was very important to some early Literalist leaders, although other Literalists and most Gnostics opposed this limitation, and the rationale for it was strained at best.</strong> Irenaeus, who we met in the last chapter, was one of the earliest and most vehement proponents of a four gospel canon, arguing that, \u201cit is not possible that there can be more or fewer than four\u201d for \u201c just as there are four regions of the universe, and four principal winds\u201d there must be only four gospels. Though hardly compelling, this rationale has been frequently cited over the centuries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Later orthodox Literalists, who ultimately assumed control over the selection process (as we will discuss below), did offer more rational justifications for limiting the gospels to four: They deemed some of the additional ones to be merely supplementary or redundant and therefore unnecessary, while they viewed others, particularly those without a Literalist bent, as outright heretical:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Of the accounts of the life of Jesus that were rejected by the Fathers, many were considered supplementary rather than false. Such was the case with the Gospels of Peter and Nicodemus and the two accounts of Christ\u2019s infancy (I and II Infancy)\u2026.</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Peter\u2019s Gospel, which was once held as high as those of Matthew and Mark, and more highly than those of Luke and John, was ultimately rejected because it differs too much in its details from the three chosen synopses. The Gospel of Thomas, one of the Nag Hammadi documents, was rejected for a very different reason. It opens by saying that he who understand the words of Jesus will be saved. This, of course, is in direct contradiction to the chosen Gospels\u2026which say that it is he who believes that will be saved\u2026. (Forward to the 1979 edition of Lost Books of the Bible at 9-10)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>The last of the \u201cchosen\u201d gospels, often called the fourth gospel, was that of John. But the modern reader may be surprised to learn that many early Christians disapproved of it selection:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Even its first generation of readers disagreed as to whether John was a true gospel or a false one\u2014and whether it should be part of the New Testament. John\u2019s defenders among early Christians revered it as the \u201clogos gospel\u201d\u2014the gospel of the divine word or reason (logos, in Greek)\u2014and derided those who opposed it as \u201cirrational\u201d (alogos, lacking reason). Its detractors, by contrast, were quick to point out that John\u2019s narrative differs significantly from those of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. [A]t crucial moments in its account, for example, John\u2019s gospel directly contradicts the combined testimony of the other New Testament gospels. (Elaine Pagels, Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas at 34-35)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Even so, because it can be bent to a Literalist interpretation, John\u2019s gospel came to be accepted as canon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>By way of contrast, the Gospel of Peter--a book much prized by most early Christians, rivaling in popularity the Gospels of Matthew and Mark and exceeding Luke and John--was ultimately rejected because it lent itself to a potentially \u201cheretical\u201d interpretation known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism\">docetism</a>. Although it came in a variety of forms, docetism can be understood for purposes of this book as the belief that Christ\u2019s divine nature kept him from experiencing true pain and suffering during his life and death. Serapion (c. 199), the orthodox Bishop of Antioch, (c. 199), concluded that because the Gospel of Peter could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with orthodox teachings (which held that Jesus suffered in the ordinary sense), it could not have been written by the Apostle Peter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>While modern scholarship has confirmed that the Gospel of Peter was not written by the historical Peter, Serapion\u2019s rationale for dismissing it should concern those who assert the Bible\u2019s infallibility. Serapion discarded the book simply because he disagreed with it, not because he had any actual evidence or knowledge of forgery. Thus, in Serapion\u2019s approach we see the beginnings of an orthodox \u201clitmus test\u201d for determining the authenticity of early Christian manuscripts\u2014those that largely agreed with the orthodox position, or could be interpreted or easily edited to do so, were frequently held to be authentic, while those that outright contradicted orthodox views were always discarded as forgeries.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Renowned scholar Bruce M. Metzger, PhD, acknowledges that the compilers of the Bible applied just such a litmus test. According to Metzger, for a book to be considered canonical it must have met three tests:</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>First, the books must have had apostolic authority\u2014that is, they must have been written either by apostles themselves, who were eyewitnesses to what they wrote about, or by followers of apostles.</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>[S]econd, there was the criterion of conformity to what was called the rule of faith. That is, was the document congruent with the basic Christian tradition that the [orthodox] church recognized as normative?&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>And third, there was the criterion of whether a document had had continuous acceptance and usage by the church at large. [Quoted in The Case For Christ at 66]</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>Other scholars have noted that the litmus test came in four parts rather than three, recognizing an additional requirement that the book be \u201cancient\u201d. But regardless, it is the second test, the \u201crule of faith\u201d, that is most intriguing to critical scholars.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>The \u201crule of faith\u201d, sometimes called the \"standard of faith\" rested on the now questionable assumption that the orthodox view of Christianity represented the exclusive authentic tradition.</strong> Under this standard, any early Christian document that contradicted the orthodox understanding was considered by the orthodox Literalists of the second and third centuries to be a forgery. <strong>For instance, the Gospel of Peter met every prong of the orthodox litmus test noted above save one\u2014the \u201crule of faith\u201d. After all, it was ostensibly written by the Apostle Peter and it was widely used and considered authentic by a great number of Christians, proving itself to be even more popular than Luke or John. The simple fact is that we don\u2019t read the Gospel of Peter in our Bibles today only because parts of it could not be reconciled with certain orthodox teachings and, as we shall see, it was the orthodox who compiled our Bibles.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Perhaps this rationale for excluding the Gospel of Peter and other books is acceptable to those who take it on faith that the orthodox tradition was the true and complete one, but it is troublesome for those who know otherwise. After all, <strong>the reasoning employed by the early orthodox is circular: \u201cWe\u2019re right and they are wrong\u201d, contended the orthodox leaders who compiled our Bibles. \u201cSo those manuscripts that agree with us are obviously authentic, while those that do not are certainly forgeries. Therefore we shall create a collection of the \u2018authentic\u2019 teachings, and then we can point to the authenticity of this collection as proof that our interpretation of Christianity is the right one.\u201d One doesn\u2019t have to be a logician to find the holes in that reasoning.</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>The Letters</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the debate over the Bible wasn\u2019t limited to the Gospels alone, but included the New Testament letters (epistles) as well. Several of the epistles in our present-day Bibles were not well respected by important early Christians, even some Literalist ones. <strong>In Origen\u2019s (c. 210) catalogue of New Testament scriptures, the Epistles of James and Jude are omitted, and Origen notes that many Christians were skeptical of 2 Peter and 2 and 3 John. More than a hundred years later, Eusebius (c. 315) states that some Christians of his time still doubted or outright rejected the authenticity of these same five books. Eusebius himself considered Revelation to be spurious. Jerome (c. 382) spoke dubiously of the epistle to the Hebrews. As late as the fifth century, the Syrian church venerated only 22 books, excluding 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude and Revelation. By contrast, the present day Ethiopian church accepts all twenty-seven books of our present day New Testament, but adds four more.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>The famous fourth century teacher known as Didymus the Blind was among those who believed that 2nd Peter was a forgery. Interestingly though, he cited the Shepard of Hermas and other noncanonical books favorably.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>The last book of the Bible, Revelation, is not included in the various catalogues of the New Testament offered by such notable early Christians as Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 340); the Bishops at the Council of Caudices (c. 364); Gregory Nazianzen, Bishop of Constantinople (c. 375); and Philastrius, Bishop of Brixia in Venice (c. 380).&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>In short, as late at 400 CE there was no accepted, universal canon of Christian scripture. And, as we shall soon see, there still isn\u2019t even today.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Forgery, Forgery Everywhere</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Forgery was commonly practiced in ancient times, so early Christians had reason to be skeptical when their opponents pointed to various manuscripts to \"cinch\" their argument. And as we shall see, we have even more reasons to be skeptical of these same manuscripts today.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Arguing in support of the integrity of our modern Bibles, Literalists often cite the research of critical scholars who have proven many of the excluded texts, such as the once-prized Gospel of Peter, to be forgeries (i.e., it was not really written by the historical Peter). But, these Literalists overlook the fact that these very same scholars have also shown several of our New Testament letters to be forgeries:</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Scholars have long recognized that even some of the books accepted into the canon are probably forgeries. Christian scholars, of course, have been loathe to call them that and so more commonly refer to them as \u201cpseudonymous\u201d writings. Possibly this is a more antiseptic term, but its does little to solve the problem of a potential deceit, for an author who attempts to pass off his own writing as that of some other well-know person has written a forgery. That is no less true of the book allegedly written to Titus that made it into the New Testament (Paul\u2019s Letter to Titus) than of the book allegedly written by Titus that did not (Pseudo-Titus), both claiming to be written by apostles (Paul and Titus), both evidently written by someone else. (Ehrman, Lost Christianities at 9)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>In fact, all of Paul\u2019s New Testament \u201cPastoral letters\u201d--1 and 2 Timothy and Titus--are now known to have been written long after Paul\u2019s death, very likely in the late first century. &nbsp;Among the New Testament books attributed to Paul, only Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, 1 Thessalonians, Philippians, Romans, and Philemon are universally recognized by critical and \u201cfaithful\u201d scholars alike as authentic.</strong> Ephesians, Colossians and 2 Thessalonians are sometimes disputed, but the definite consensus of critical scholars is that they are either fabrications or severely edited versions of some now lost originals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Although I cannot document here all of the various, compelling reasons why critical scholars are so sure that many New Testament epistles are faked, I will take a moment here discuss the Pastorals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In addition to the skepticism expressed by early prominent Christians and church fathers like those noted in the previous section above, the earliest extant catalogue of Paul\u2019s letters makes no mention at all of the Pastorals. Indeed, there is no evidence of their existence prior to c. 190 when Irenaeus conveniently makes mention of them. And yet, even despite these references by Irenaeus, Eusebius (c. 300), the so-called \u201cFather of Church History\u201d, does not include the Pastorals in his catalogue of the books of sacred scripture, even though he definitely knew of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But modern scholars have many additional reasons for doubting the authenticity of the Pastorals. For one, they curiously reference aspects of church structure and hierarchical governance that, although favored by the orthodox, did not exist during Paul\u2019s lifetime. The structure of church governance discussed in the Pastorals (a top-down hierarchy) is in many ways inconsistent and irreconcilable with the organizational structure of Paul\u2019s churches described in his authentic writings (which took a more democratic, bottom-up presbyterian approach).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Additionally, the vocabulary and tone of the Pastorals is curious. They use a number of words not found elsewhere in Paul\u2019s authentic writings, and specifically contradict the teachings of the known authentic writings on many points. Not surprisingly, these points of contradiction typically advance an orthodox understanding of Christianity, with the Pastorals apparently serving to \u201cclarify\u201d those parts of Paul\u2019s authentic writings that lent themselves to a Gnostic, \"heretical\" interpretation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>For these and other reasons, critical scholars are in near unanimous agreement that the Pastorals are second century forgeries, and rather poor ones at that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Circumstantial Evidence of Forgery</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Although the most \u201cfaithful\u201d of Literalist attempt to dispute the direct evidence of forgery noted above--rationalizing, for example, that the unusual vocabulary of the Pastorals might be attributable to the fact that Paul may have dictated his various letters at different times to different scribes who sometimes paraphrased him (while nonetheless perfectly preserving his \"divinely inspired\" message, we are assured)--<strong>there can be no dispute on the following point: To advance their cause, certain highly educated proto-orthodox forgers authored letters in the names of the Apostles or their followers, letters that their descendants eventually excluded from the Bible for one reason or another. </strong>For example, as mentioned previously, some orthodox sympathizer forged a letter from Titus, now called \u201cPseudo-Titus\u201d (meaning \u201cfalse Titus\u201d), that is not found in our New Testament. Extra-biblical documents forged in the name of the Apostle Paul include 3 Corinthians (created in the second century largely in order to undermine the docetic \u201cheresy\u201d, it was eventually accepted as canonical only by the Armenian church and certain Syrian churches), several letters from Paul to the Roman philosopher Seneca (designed to cast Paul as a great philosopher), and at least one to the church at Laodicea. Yet other known Pauline forgeries are lost to history\u2014we know them only because they are referenced in ancient writings that have been preserved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Faithful readers should not be surprised that all these letters were being forged in Paul\u2019s name. After all, 2 Thessalonians (2:2) records that Paul was concerned that people were forging letters in his name even in his own time. However:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>In an interesting twist, scholars today are not altogether confident that 2 Thessalonians itself was written by Paul. And so we have a neat irony: either 2 Thessalonians was written by Paul and someone else was producing forgeries in Paul\u2019s name, or 2 Thessalonians itself is a forgery that condemns the production of forgeries in Paul\u2019s name. Either way, someone was forging books in Paul\u2019s name. (Lost Christianities at 10)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Although these undisputed forgeries weren\u2019t included in our New Testaments, to the relief of many Literalists, their mere existence casts additional doubt on many of the books that did. These extra-biblical forgeries prove indisputably that some early, highly-educated proto-orthodox sympathizers--members of the very group whose spiritual descendants ultimately organized and canonized the New Testament as Holy Writ (as we shall see)--were ready, willing, and able to employ deceit to advance their cause and to undermine the authority of their Christian opponents, going even so far as to forge letters in the name of key Apostles. Even the Catholic Encyclopedia admits as much: \"Both Catholics and Gnostics were concerned in writing these fictions. The former had no motive other than that of pious fraud.\" Gnostic forgeries were then presumably \"impious frauds.\"&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Combine this known and admitted propensity for forgery with the doctrine-based litmus test later adopted by their descendants for purposes determining the authenticity of ancient Christian documents, and it would be a divinely inspired miracle indeed if some forgeries didn\u2019t make it into our New Testaments.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>So, even if we ignore the all-but-conclusive direct evidence of forgery within our New Testament, we have compelling circumstantial evidence as well: We know with certainty that the Literalist Church had the means to commit forgery, as evidenced by, among other things, their extant forgeries that did not make it into the New Testament. We also know that the Literalists had the motive to forge documents and include them in the canon (e.g., by forging documents in Apostles\u2019 names and designating those documents as the infallible Word of God, Literalists would gain an advantage in the battles for the heart and soul of early Christianity). Finally, Literalists had the opportunity to include forged documents in the Bible: A century or two after these documents were forged, the spiritual descendants of these Literalist forgers attempted to \"close the cannon\" and adpoted a doctrine-based litmus test of authenticity that all but assured some forged documents would be canonized.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In light of this evidence, it is only the most \u201cfaithful\u201d of Christians who deny that parts of the New Testament are obvious forgeries. Sadly, such \u201cfaithfulness\u201d borders on irrationality: It is not merely \u201cevidence of things unseen\u201d (as Paul defined faith), but the irrational rejection of things seen plainly. It is not merely an acceptance of the unprovable, but acceptance in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Why should anyone have such faith? More importantly, why would a benevolent, loving God have made such irrational faith a precondition of salvation? I can think of no reason at all, but I can, and have, identified many reasons why less than benevolent, power-driven humans did so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Bibles, Bibles Everywhere</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Even if we ignore the known forgeries in the New Testament, there are many other problems with Literalist claims of the Bible's infallibility. One is that, as previously alluded, there is simply no such thing as the Bible. <strong>Over centuries what we now call the Bible has undergone numerous changes, and \"the\" church has never enjoyed a definitive version. </strong>For example, the identity of the books comprising the Old Testament has changed over the years, the Apocrypha was dropped from the Protestant Bible altogether after the Council of Trent (1545-1563) and, as we have seen, the books of the New Testament weren\u2019t fixed until the late fourth century or early fifth century, and even then there still wasn\u2019t complete unanimity in Christendom. <strong>The Catholic Encyclopedia admits, \"The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning...has no foundation in history.\"&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Another problem with claims of biblical infallibility is that, even today (and ignoring disputes over which books are canonical) we have numerous versions of \u201cthe\u201d Bible. <strong>Just since the King James Version was first published in the early 1600\u2019s, English speaking peoples have seen more than three hundred English translations of the Bible alone! </strong>A trip to the local bookstore will acquaint the reader with some of these, and a somewhat more comprehensive listing can be found here.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>So, why the need for so many Bibles?</h3>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>Well, different versions exist for two primary reasons: (1) scholars disagree about which of the ancient manuscripts should be translated into our modern Bibles, and (2) translators disagree as to how to properly translate a given manuscript into a language understandable by modern audiences. Let\u2019s discuss each of these disagreements, beginning with the last one first.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Difficult Translations</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Jesus and his immediate followers, like most Jews of Palestine for centuries before them, spoke Aramaic, a language that is all but dead today. However, the oldest complete New Testament manuscripts still in existence are all written in an ancient form of Greek, called \u201cKoine\u201d, and all of these oldest manuscripts are \u201cuncials\u201d, meaning that they are written in only capital Greek letters with no spaces between words, no line breaks, and almost no punctuation marks\u2014i.e., no periods, no commas, no page breaks, and no exclamation points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>These facts are important for several reasons. First, they demonstrate that, with only a few exceptions, even the oldest existing copies of the New Testament capture the words of Jesus and the Apostles only in translated form. </strong>We do not know the actual words that were originally spoken by Jesus and his Apostles in Aramaic, rather we have only a Greek hearsay translation. And, unfortunately, something is always lost in translation: As Rabbi Judah eloquently stated, \u201cHe who translates a biblical verse literally is a liar, but he who elaborates on it is a blasphemer.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The translator\u2019s job is to express in language understandable to his audience the meaning of words originally spoken or written by someone else using a different language. Given linguistic differences in grammar, syntax, punctuation and figures of speech, this is no easy task under the best of circumstances\u2014but, Bible translators face additional complications. NAMELYTHEYARECHARGEDWITHACCURATELYTRANSLATINGANCIENTMANUSCRIPTSTHATAREWRITTENINALLCAPSDEVOIDOFPUNTUATIONORSPACESANDTHATWEREWRITTENTHOUSANDSOFYEARSAGOINLANGUAGEORDIALECTSTHATHAVEBEENDEADFORCENTURIES.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>If that last \"all caps\" sentence didn\u2019t make any sense, it is only because I wrote it in uncial form in hopes of giving the reader some appreciation for the difficult task of translating ancient uncials. Here\u2019s what I actually said: \u201cNamely they are charged with accurately translating ancient manuscripts that were written in all caps, which are virtually devoid of punctuation marks or spaces, and that were written thousands of years ago in languages or dialects that have been dead for centuries.\" If the reader had difficulty making sense of the \"all caps\" phrase above (even though it was written in modernEnglish), imagine how much greater the difficulty of interpreting a dead, foreign language written in such a manner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The first step in any translation of an ancient document is to develop an understanding of the original author\u2019s intent. As anyone who has ever attempted to interpret a document knows, this is more art than science, especially when the original author has been dead for two millennia, came from a foreign culture, and spoke a dead language. Given the difficultly that each present day generation has in understanding the next one (and vice versa), imagine how much more difficult it must be for a modern translator to truly see the world through the eyes of a first century writer from another culture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>In short, despite their best efforts, a translator\u2019s presuppositions (paradigms) affect his or her understanding of the original writer\u2019s intent, and therefore taint his or her interpretation of the original writer\u2019s words. The Preface to the New King James Version of the Bible, which is itself \u201cthe fifth revision of a historic document translated from specific Greek texts\u201d, is to be commended for acknowledging as much explicitly:</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>[T]he most important differences in the English New Testaments of today are due\u2026to the way in which translators view the task of translation: How literally should the [original] text be rendered? How does the translator view the matter of biblical inspiration? Does the translator adopt a paraphrase when a literal rendering would be quite clear and more to the point?\u201d [parentheticals and emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>In other words, as the preface to the New King James version makes clear, the meaning of the translated Bible varies according to the particular translator\u2019s presuppositions, including whether or not the translator presupposes that the Bible is a spiritual book written by mortals, or a divinely inspired book of history. Or, said another way, the Paradigm of Historicity affects the translation! In this manner, centuries of translator bias (until very recently, almost exclusively Literalist ones) have been not-so-subtly incorporated into the substance of the most Bible versions available to us today. We will expose many of these as we proceed.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Assuming a translator can overcome the first challenge of truly understanding the intent of the original writer, the second step in translation is to then render the that understanding in language comprehensible to the translator\u2019s audience. The Christian William Tyndale was the first translator to offer an English Bible (c. 1526) derived from the most ancient Greek manuscripts available at the time (rather than later Latin manuscripts that had served as the basis for most previous translations). For this, he was eventually burned at the stake for heresy. Even so, many of his words survive to this day. It was Tyndale who, via artful translation, created from whole cloth many of the most memorable words and phrases found in our modern Bibles:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It was Tyndale who established \u2026that the Bible should not be in the language of scholars but in the spoken language of the people. [H]e coined such words as \u201cPassover,\u201d \u201cscapegoat,\u201d \u201cmercy seat,\u201d and \u201clong-suffering.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote><br></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Many expressions of Tyndale are also unforgettable, cherished by countless readers of the English Bible: \u201cthe kingdom of heaven is at hand\u201d (Matt. 3:2); \u201cthe pinnacle of the temple\u201d (Matt. 4:5); \u201cthe salt of the earth\u201d (Matt. 5:13); \u201cdaily bread\u201d (Matt. 6:11); \u201cConsider the lilies of the field, how they grow\u201d (Matt. 6:28); \u201cmeek and lowly in heart\u201d (Matt 11:29); \u201cshepherds abiding in the field\u201d (Luke 2:8); \u201ceat, drink, and be merry\u201d (Luke 12:19); \u201cfatted calf\u201d (Luke 15:23); \u201conly begotten son\u201d (John 1:14, 18); \u201cin my Father\u2019s house are many mansions\u201d (John 14:2); \u201cin whom we live and move and have our being\u201d (Acts 17:28); \u201cGod forbid\u201d (Rom 3:4); \u201csounding brass\u201d and \u201ctinkling cymbal\u201d (1 Cor. 13:1); \u201cin the twinkling of an eye\u201d (1 Cor. 15:52); \u201csinging and making melody (Eph. 5:19); \u201coffice of a bishop\u201d (1 Tim. 3:1); \u201cthe pleasures of sin for a season\u201d (Heb. 11:25); \u201can advocate with the Father\u201d (1 John 2:1); and \u201cBehold, I stand at the door and knock\u201d (Rev 3:20). (How We Got the Bible at 178-179)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Despite their familiarity, the above expressions do not appear in the original Greek, at least not in so many words:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>[I]t is noteworthy that these expressions could have been translated differently from the Greek text, yet because Tyndale had such an ear for the English language, these [para]phrases live on. [parentheticals added]. (How We Got the Bible at 179)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In short, as previously stated, something is always lost (and sometimes added)in translation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>An Important Diversion to Discuss Misleading Translations&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Before moving on to discuss the second primary reason that there are so many versions of the Bible\u2014namely, disagreements over which ancient documents to translate,--its worth pausing here to explore the significance of translator bias. <strong>Until very recently, virtually all Bible translations were overseen by committed Christians steeped in the Literalist, orthodox tradition. Even most of the so-called heretics of the last thousand years were, like William Tyndale, Literalists. Consequently, the Paradigm of Historicity, and all orthodox doctrines derived therefrom, weighed heavily on their efforts, and the biases of these original translators have influenced subsequent translations ever since.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Translators who presuppose that the Bible is the \u201cinspired\u201d word of God naturally \u201cview the task of translation\u201d, if only unconsciously, as supporting this idea.</strong> <strong>Such translators assume that God\u2019s inspired Word simply can\u2019t contradict itself or contain error. Thus, centuries of translators have adopted interpretations and translations that seek to reconcile or downplay inconsistencies or discrepancies that are evident in the original tongue. For example:</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>All of the Gospels present but one view of Jesus, that he is the Son of God. Yet in presenting this view their individual descriptions of him and his sayings often employ different words. Through the years, these verbal distinctions, either intentionally or unintentionally, tended to be \u201charmonized\u201d by the scribes. Thus it is a sound conclusion that in parallel accounts the text which preserves the minute verbal differences is generally the [more authentic] text. (How We Got the Bible at 93)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The result of this translator and scribal bias for consistency is that some parts of our modern Bibles appear to modern readers to be more of a coherent whole than they actually are, while other parts appear to less of a whole than they should. The following pages will provide numerous examples of the former, but here I will note one very basic example of the latter:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>\u201cJesus\u201d is the Greek rendering of the Hebrew name \u201cJoshua\u201d, meaning \u201csavior.\u201d It was a very common name among first century Jews. And yet it has become customary among translators to render the name of the Old Testament hero of Exodus as \u201cJoshua\u201d and that of the New Testament hero of the same name as \u201cJesus\u201d. Inconsistently translating these names adds to Jesus\u2019 uniqueness while at the same time obscuring certain similarities in the lives and actions of the two biblical heroes that may otherwise be obvious. The differing nomenclature discourages the reader from drawing analogies between the lives of the two figures, analogies that the authors of the gospels almost certainly intended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Translator bias has also served to obscure some striking similarities between the New Testament and other Gnostic scriptures. The Bible is almost always rendered in the familiar \u201cchurch speak\u201d originally adopted by Literalist translators over the centuries. However, it\u2019s important to understand that identical Greek words and ideas appearing in surviving Gnostic writings are typically rendered in unfamiliar \u201cpagan\u201d, heretical language, or simply left un-translated altogether, making these works seem more foreign, bizarre, and incredible than they should. To illustrate the point, let\u2019s consider just how strange, dare I say Gnostic, parts of the New Testament sound if we translate them from the Greek using the same principles often employed when translating Gnostic manuscripts.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Greek word for wisdom is \u201cSophia\u201d, which is also the name of the Greek goddess that personified the same. In Gnostic mythology, Sophia was the companion and lover of the Logos (often translated as \u201cword\u2019, which we will discuss more below), which all Christians equate with Christ (thanks to the opening chapter of the fourth gospel). This may be one reason why translators almost always translate the Greek word \u201cSophia\u201d as simply \u201cwisdom\u201d in the New Testament, but as \u201cSophia\u201d in most Gnostic texts. But is such inconsistent treatment justified? <strong>What happens, for example, when we translate some familiar Bible passages using principals of translation traditionally applied to Gnostic texts? Let\u2019s begin with words attributed to Paul in Colossians 1:8 (highlighted words are those that have been reworded using more consistently applied principles of translation, as is done with non-canonical books from the time):</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>We proclaim [Christ]\u2026teaching every man in the ways of Sophia that each may become an initiated member of Christ. (Colossians 1:28)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Translated in this manner, and remembering that in Gnostic theology, Sophia was the lover of the Logos (Christ), Paul sounds\u2026well\u2026radical. In essence, Paul teaches that we become one with Christ (that is, \u201cmembers\u201d of Christ) by learning the ways (i.e., assuming the role) of his mythical lover, Sophia. Though strange, this lesson is actually consistent with orthodox doctrine that the church is the \u201cbride of Christ\u201d, and it is also indistinguishable from the Gnostic teaching on this subject.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Continuing:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>My purpose is that they may\u2026become one in love, so that they may\u2026experience the Gnosis of God\u2019s mystery, namely, Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of Sophia and Gnosis. [emphasis added] (Colossians 2:2-3)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Here Paul teaches that mystical \u201coneness\u201d is achieved through Gnosis (or experiential knowledge) of God\u2019s \u201cmystery\u201d, which he defines as Christ. Christ is not discussed as an historical personage, but as a higher consciousness that, once identified with to the exclusion of our ego (i.e., once we become one with it), leads to spiritual insight\u2014hidden wisdom (Sophia) and knowledge (gnosis). This is pure Christian Gnosticism, plain and simple. Only the common misleading translation keeps us from seeing it as such.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Proceeding further:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>We speak of Sophia among the initiated; not the Sophia of this aeon, nor of the rulers of this aeon, who are passing away; but we speak of God\u2019s Sophia in a mystery. (1 Corinthians 2:6)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It is central to our faith that in the end we will all attain Oneness through Gnosis of God\u2019s Son, becoming fully initiated human beings, equal to nothing less than the pleroma of Christ. (Ephesians 4:13)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>\u201cGod\u2019s Sophia\u201d, \u201cinitiated\u201d, \u201cmystery\u201d, \u201caeons\u201d, \u201coneness\u201d and \u201cpleroma\u201d, all of these are quintessentially Gnostic terms, terms one would find repeated over and over in most any Christian Gnostic texts such as those found at Nag Hammadi. And yet, although they are expressed in the original Greek manuscripts of our Bibles, these terms are foreign to most Christians simply because bias, primarily the doctrine of divine inspiration and the Paradigm of Historicity, keeps translators from expressing Paul in this way. Rather than use the word \u201cinitiated\u201d, which is a more proper and accurate translation of the original Greek, and one they surely would have used if translating the same word in a Gnostic text, translators substitute the word \u201cmature.\u201d Rather than use the Greek word \u201cGnosis\u201d, which describes subjective, experiential knowledge (like knowing how to ride a bike) as opposed to objective, intellectual knowledge (like one plus one equals two), translators just use the more antiseptic (if somewhat misleading) English word \u201cknowledge\u201d, which has the added benefit of obscuring Paul\u2019s Gnostic tendencies.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Another example of a translation that obscures the similarities between the Gnostic texts and the New Testament is the rendering of logos in many Gnostic texts as logos, but in the New Testament as \u201cWord\u201d (such as in John 1:1) The Greek word logos, which is the root of the English word \u201clogic\u201d, has no strict English equivalent. It can be alternatively translated as \u201cword\u201d, \u201creason\u201d, or \u201cidea\u201d depending upon context, but it actually contains elements of all three, plus more. No one English word captures the true essence of the Greek logos.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In the centuries before and immediately after Jesus, \"logos\" was a term of art used by pagan philosophers and adepts of the Mysteries Religions, including the Christian Gnostics. They generally used it to describe the thoughts of God\u2019s Mind through which God created and sustains the universe, or said another way, the objects of God\u2019s consciousness. To put it in terms readily understandable to most present-day Literalist Christians, before God spoke the words \u201cLet there by light\u201d (Genesis 1:3), God had to first have the idea (logos) of light in mind, else his words would have had no meaning or effect. Because thought, which is made manifest in words, must precede action, Gnostics came to view God\u2019s thoughts/ideas/words as the true source and sustainer of all Creation, present with God \u201cin the beginning\u201d, for creation could not exist prior to God conceiving of it. These divine thoughts or ideas, which are separate from God and yet one with Him (in the same sense that our thoughts are separate from our minds yet have no existence outside of them) are the divine logos. It will serve our purposes sufficiently if we conceptualize the divine logos for now as God\u2019s consciousness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In Gnostic mythology, which the reader will recall contains much figurative language, creation is the result of the one transcendent God becoming consciousness of Himself. Exactly how this happened is a mystery symbolized in numerous and varying myths, but Gnostics reasoned rightly that consciousness requires both a subject and an object\u2014that is, there must be a witness (the person or thing that is conscious\u2014i.e., the \u201cmind\u201d) as well as the witnessed (i.e., the person or thing of which on is conscious, or the \u201cthought\u201d). In the Gnostic allegorical myths that seek to encode this truth, Gnostics often referred to the original witness (i.e., the \u201cmind\u201d of God) as \u201cthe Father\u201d. Likewise, they referred to the thoughts of that Divine Mind, the ideas which God\u2019s Mind contemplates, as \u201cthe Son\u201d or \u201cthe Logos\u201d (Word). Thus, thoughts (the Son) were conceptualized as the \u201coffspring\u201d or \u201cfirst born\u201d or \u201cbegotten\u201d of the mind (the Father), present with God at the dawn of creation. Before God thought, nothing was, for consciousness did not exist. Thus, Father and Son are as inseparable as thought is from mind. The Athanasian Creed expresses these ideas perfectly:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten, The Son is of the Father alone, neither made nor created, but begotten. [N]one is afore or after the other, none is greater or less than another.</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And, as Origen once noted, \u201cThe Father did not beget the Son, but ever is begetting him.\u201d</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>The experience of this simple idea was almost certainly part of the fundamental Inner Mystery taught by all Gnostic Mystery Schools in the centuries before and after Jesus. Centuries before Christ the pagan Gnostic Heraclitus (c. 600 BCE) wrote, \u201cThe Father and Son are the same.\u201d According to Clement of Alexandria, the pagan Gnostic Euripides had years before \u201cdivined as in a riddle that the Father and the Son are one God.\u201d The legendary pagan sage Orpheus, who lived, if at all, thousands of years before Christ, is quoted by the Christian Clement of Alexandria as having taught:&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Behold the Logos divine. Tread well the narrow path of life and gaze on Him, the world\u2019s great ruler, our immortal king. (Quoted in The Jesus Mysteries at 83)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Clement of Alexandria himself writes:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>The Son is the Consciousness of God. The Father only sees the world as reflected in the Son. (Quoted in The Jesus Mysteries at 84) [parentheticals added]</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Continuing with this idea for a moment, it is important to note that Gnostics sought to explain the mystery of human consciousness by characterizing it as fragmented, dispersed pieces of the One Divine Consciousness\u2014that is, of the Son or logos, which Christians specifically equate with Christ. How portions of the One Divine Consciousness came to be dismembered and encapsulated within each of us, how we lost our ability to \u201caccess\u201d or \u201crely on\u201d it in our daily lives, and how we can regain it, are all mysteries described allegorically in many Gnostic and Christian myths. For Christians, the most important of these myths are those describing the Incarnation of Christ (God\u2019s consciousness becoming encapsulated in man), the Fall of Man (man losing his ability to rely on that consciousness and instead being ruled by his unconscious paradigms and passions, which Paul called \u201cthe flesh\u201d), and Christ\u2019s Crucifixion and Resurrection (describing the way back to union with God, or oneness with the cosmic consciousness).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>These Gnostic teachings about the dispersion of human consciousness, and its reunion with God, may seem quite strange to Literalists, so I will again remind the reader of just a few of Paul\u2019s words on this subject:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>For just as the body is a unity and yet has many members, and all the members, though many , form only one body, so it is with Christ\u2026.[i.e., the logos or Son]. For by means of one shared Spirit [or consciousness] we were all baptized into one [spiritual] body\u2026.&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>Now you (collectively) are Christ\u2019s body [i.e., the Logos, the One Divine Consciousness], and individually members [i.e., dispersed pieces] of it. (1 Corinthians 12:11-27)</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>It is inherent in our faith that in the end we will all attain Oneness through Gnosis of God\u2019s Son, becoming fully initiated human beings, equal to nothing less than the pleroma [fullness] of Christ. [Ephesians 4:13 as rendered in Jesus and the Lost Goddess at 149))</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In Ephesians 4:25, Paul writes \u201c[w]e are all parts of one body and members one of another.\u201d In Colossians 1:25-28, Paul writes that his purpose in life is to reveal to us the Mystery that was hidden in past ages--namely, that Christ (i.e., the logos) is in us! In Galations 1:15, Paul writes that \u201cGod revealed his Son in me\u201d [emphasis added]. Demonstrating that he had come to identify completely with this higher consciousness within him, and ceased identifying with his ego, Paul states, \u201c[I]t is no longer I [i.e., my ego or \"flesh\"] who live, but Christ [the logos] lives in me; and the life I now live in this body I live by faith\u2014by reliance on and complete trust in the Son of God\u2026.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>As we have previously noted, Jesus offers the same teachings, most explicitly in the Gospel of John (17:19-26). There, Jesus prays that his followers will come to know their true nature. He prays that they will be \u201csanctified by the Truth\u201d so that they:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>all may be One--just as You, Father, are in Me and I in you, they also may be One in Us. [I] in them and You in Me, in order that they may become One and perfectly united....</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>And nowhere is this pre-Christian, Gnostic teaching of creation emerging from the oneness of God through the facility of the logos (which is then dispersed among all peoples) better illustrated than in the opening Chapter of the Gospel of John (v. 1-4):&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote>In the beginning was the Logos [i.e., Divine Consciousness, or thoughts of God, confusingly translated as \u201cthe Word\u201d], and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things came into being by Him, and apart from him nothing came into being [i.e., nothing existed prior to God becoming conscious]. In him was the life and that life was the light [i.e., consciousness] of men.</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I could continue with innumerable examples of how misleading translations, warped as they are by the Paradigm of Historicity and doctrine of divine inspiration, have served to obscure similarities between Gnostic and Literalist texts. But the above is hopefully sufficient evidence for now that, properly translated and freed of the Paradigm of Historicity, large parts of the New Testament support, indeed demand, a Gnostic interpretation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>(to be continued in Chapter 5, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/god/@sean-king/reading-the-bible-is-like-picking-out-diamonds-from-dunghills-part-2\">Part 2</a>)</p>\n<h2><br></h2>\n</html>",

    "body": "With the implementation of steemit **Promoted** content there has been much talk on post visibility and curation. The thought for an up vote multiplier came up in a comment by @mark-waser in response to @calaber24p's post <a href='https://steemit.com/steemit/@calaber24p/we-as-a-community-need-to-create-a-better-new-user-experience'>Better New User Experience</a> saying essentially that we need to give more power to new users...  in order to make them feel like they have an impact on the platform and to keep them around. \n\nNow I do agree that most new users may not have the best luck or experience during their first couple of posts. I understand it may be frustrating to work on a post for hours and have it amount to $.05 or even $0.00 in rewards. This doesn't mean we should be giving every new user the ability to earn more from less powerful votes or even give more with less power. There is a way for newer, steem lacking, users to contribute more effectively and that would be an UpVote Multiplier option. At the cost of their **Voting Power %** any user could multiply their vote up to **10 fold**. This would allow them to give a post everything they got when it comes to curation and visibility.\n\n<h1>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/vote_multipler_177799.png</h1>\n\n<h1>How would this work?</h1>\n\n**Possible Solutions**\n- Only for users under 100M Vested (Current Minimum for Slider Voting Percentage)\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/sadwhale6c4f0.jpg\n\n- Using the multiplier would dramatically decrease your voting power\nI think this would be important to have the multiplying for your vote be a serious decision and would limit the use of its potential $ power. \nExample Formula below: *Regular Vote % Cost = Rv | Multiplier = M | New Voting % Cost = NRv*\n<code>  NRv = (Rv(M)) + ((M)2)  </code>\n\n**I'll use myself as an example**\nBase: I just Upvoted a post and it cost me 1 % of my voting power and the post received $.11 \n\nIf I were to give this vote a 4x Multiplier using the above formula (my voting % cost would be)\n<code>  12% = (1 * 4) + (4*2) </code>\n*This would result in $.44 going to the upvoted post*\n\nIf I were to give this vote a 10x Multiplier using the above formula (my voting % cost would be)\n<code>  30% = (1 * 10) + (10*2) </code>\n*This would result in $1.10 going to the upvoted post!*\n**You can see at this point my vote is worth a hell of a lot more and the post have a much higher chance of trending**\n*especially when compiled onto of other votes*\n\nThis was by giving a bigger reward to a post it will cost you. \n\n- **Potential UI designs for the Upvote Multiplier**\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/vote_multipler_2d83d7.png\n\n- **Although I think this would end up creating massive rewards (too high) I designed UI designs for users who currently have the pop up slider**\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/vote_multipler_357821.png\n\n*As you can see in the designs I also agree with @summon on his idea for having the % editing able for more accurate voting*\n\n**Some potential problems?**\n\n- Users overusing the Multiplier and limiting themselves to a very small number of votes per 24 hours. \nThis may cause a lot less interactions (upvotes and comments) overall on the platform. \n*However I feel as though (Myself Included) many users only upvote a few times a day right now and new users from lack of ability to impact the upvoted post , don't up vote at all*\n\n- I really want to open this up to a solid discussion so please comment and get it rolling\n\nLook forward to the comments, concerns, ideas, concepts , and everything in between. \n\nBlue",

Well, Dapple allows you to keep your source code wherever you\nwant (by configuring the `sol_sources` property in your `dappfile`),\nand so far the convention has always been to put it in `contracts/`.\n\nNexus has decided to move away from this convention as part of a more\ngeneral policy to try to whenever possible avoid the term \"contract\".\nBecause \"smart contracts\" are neither smart nor contracts, and because\nthe term \"contract\" in particular already means something different,\nwe are taking this opportunity to move to the tried-and-true `src/`.\n\nIf you think of a directory as a \"vault\" for source code, then you see\nwhy it made sense to bring this up in the context of today's dapp. :-)",

    "body": "http://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/chilling.JPG\n\n# Sunday 8/28/2016 - Wilder Ranch State Park, Santa Cruz, CA\n\nWilder Ranch lies just beyond the western boundary of Santa Cruz. it runs from the coast across almost 10,000 acres up towards the redwood covered mountains beyond the UCSC campus.\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/wilder_all.jpg\n\nFor this adventure we pulled off to the right of Highway 1 and scrambled up the steep roadcut towards the ocean. This part of Wilder Ranch is made up of coastal bluffs. The vegetation here is a coarse patchwork of sagebrush, coyote bush, lupines and yarrow. Don't forget the ubiquitous poison oak!  \n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/riparian.JPG\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/riparian2.JPG\n\nThe riparian corridors are inaccessible but are lush even in the heat of late summer. Willows and alders make up the bulk of the overstory, while tulle reeds, bulrushes, and sedges choke the flooded streams that can't yet reach to the ocean.\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/midden_all.jpg\n\nWilder is home to not only a wealth of natural wonders but also some archaeological ones. Wilder ranch features several midden sites. Middens are human-created deposits of shell, bone and stone fragments; basically indigenous American refuse piles. These middens belonged Ohlone people.\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/field1.jpg\n\nYou don't have to travel far to find the first one. It's right there, crumbling into the highway! As you climb the roadcut you'll notice specks of white in the hard packed earth. These are bits of broken shell. At the top of the climb the ground levels out, and an empty field is the first stop on our adventure.\n\nUnder the shrubs, you can find a scatter of stone and bone. Colourful, glassy flakes of chert are easy to spot against the dull mudstone.\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/chert1.jpg\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/chert2.jpg\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/romanrobots1.jpg\n*romanrobots for scale*\n\nUnder the grass, rich dark soil hides.\n \nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/gopher.jpg\n\n The gophers do the work for us, disturbing the ground and pushing up cultural artifacts. This is both a blessing and curse! Archaeologists can determine the age of an artifact based on its depth. Excavations happen centimeter by centimeter to record the deposition of artifacts and soil over time. Gophers however disturb this 'statigraphy' by moving earth as they burrow. The figure that sticks out in my mind from school is something around a ton of earth in the course of its life. \n\nAs we walked,  I observed the contents that the gophers had delivered to the surface. A few large mussel shell fragments, some chips of chert, a bone fragment (it looked like portion of a rib to me!).\n\n# Obsidian\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/obsidian_all.jpg\n\nAt first I thought it was a bit of broken glass. The neck of a beer bottle, but something bothered me about its shape and the edges. As you can see from the pictures, there are conchoidal (half circle) fractures usually produced by a blow. The edges certainly do look worked. The rainbow sheen is also a clue. \n\nObsidian was a valuable resource for the Ohlone, because it isn't found around here. It was imported into the region from the volcanic north. While buying something from Arcadia or Redding and having it delivered to your door is easy as pie today, in prehistory it was quite a feat! Transporting razor sharp rocks hundreds of miles through a sophisticated trade network without so much as a horse and cart is an incredible thing! \n\n# Half a Biface?\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/biface2.jpg\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/biface1.jpg\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/biface3.jpg\n\nThe second find of note was a half-biface shaped piece of chert that appeared to be worked into the familiar \u2018arrowhead\u2019 shape. However it was missing it\u2019s second half. This could have been a crafting error, or possibly another tool with only one cutting side. Worked stone tools were treasured artifacts and were often repurposed after they broke in the course of their life.\n\n# Bone with Cut Marks?!\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/bone1.jpg\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/bone2.jpg\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/bone3.jpg\n\nI\u2019d need a microscope to tell, but the distal end of the this deer tibia (guess, didn\u2019t have my osteology books with me!) appears to have some cut marks on it! In my previous visits, I\u2019ve never found this large a mammal bone in these small gopher piles! \n\n# To the Beach! \n \nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/beach.jpg\n\nWe take the coastal trail that takes us past the small farm and the scrubby brush surrounding the neat rows of rosemary. The shrubs are teeming with birds, and the ground is littered with terrestrial snail shells. The path curves along the riparian corridor and brings us to the overlook. \n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/nomansbeach.JPG\n\nThis beach is off limits to humans. Flocks of birds and the occasional seal carcass are all I can spot with my binoculars. The path follows the cliffs dipping down towards a beach for human access. This small sandy outcrop is hemmed in by the mudstone cliffs one both side. At the back of the beach cut out of the soft stone you can find a sea cave draped in ferns!  \nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/cave_all.jpg\n\nI have yet to explore the back of it. I\u2019m afraid of who I might find sleeping inside. We watch the waves for a few moments before resuming our loop through the park. From our vantage point on the cliffs I spot seals on the tidal benches below.\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/chilling.JPG\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/seals1.JPG\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/seals2.JPG\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/seal3.JPG\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/seal4.JPG\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/seal5.JPG\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/seal6.JPG\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/seal7.JPG\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/seal8.JPG\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/seal9.JPG\n\nAs we watched them, we noticed that the ones in the water would deliberately splash with one flipper smacking the water. It would often be echoed by another seal nearby. \n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/splash.JPG\n\nEventually one of the seals noticed us on the cliffs and decided that it was time to scoot. \n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/escape_all.jpg\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/greatescape.JPG\n\nWe started a bit of stampede.\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/birds.JPG\n\nThe cormorants were settled in for the night. The sun was getting low in the sky so we moved on. The trail isn\u2019t a long one. Soon we were on the other side of the rosemary farm. \n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/farm.JPG\n\nEagle-eyed romanrobots spotted a little quail, who we swore was some kind of fat little bird at this angle because it looked just like a round little ball.\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/quail.JPG\n\nWilder Ranch\u2019s Coastal Trail is quick little jaunt through the coastal scrub and grasslands of Santa Cruz, County. Keep your eyes on the ground and you may find specks of white shell. Birds, lizards, and marine mammals are just some of the wildlife you\u2019ll encounter! Bring a flashlight, some water, your binoculars and as always your sense of wonder!\n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/Wildranch/sunset.jpg\n\nLove, \nRen\u00e9e",

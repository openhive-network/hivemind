It stinks in here, Ange.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ange turned to her friend and was very puzzled.\n\u201cI mean it\u2019s a mixture of tom-cat pee and...\u201d Dusty paused, she didn\u2019t know if she should go so far as to describe exactly what she could smell, but then she decided, in for a penny... \u201cWell, you know when someone\u2019s had sex and they\u2019re not exactly hygienic to begin with?\u201d Dusty asked carefully and waited for Ange\u2019s nod. \u201cThat horrible sharp, fishy smell?\u201d Dusty left it at that and allowed Ange to catch her meaning.\n\u201cOh God, no! My bedroom doesn\u2019t smell that bad does it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it does, but it won\u2019t in a while, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Dusty bent to pick up the sheets and saw the sticky mess that Ange had begun to clean up. It had soaked through the bottom sheet, onto the bed and left a large stain like an old bloodstain that someone had made a half-hearted attempt at cleaning. The sheet was in much the same state but the stain was still wet, and cold was emanating from the centre of the bundled sheets.\nDusty held the sheet out to Ange and against her better judgement, she bent forward and took a sniff. \nDusty threw the bundle out onto the landing as Ange recovered from the overpowering stench that had assailed her nostrils.\n\u201cCome on, we\u2019ve got to clear the room.\u201d Dusty told Ange.\n\nThey worked together for the rest of the morning, taking out the mattress together and leaning it up against the banister and then moving the bed and standing it up against the wall. They were fortunate in the fact that the bed was one of those low, modern ones that didn\u2019t take much shifting or hefting. Then Dusty began to lift the carpet at the corner of the room. Ange asked what she was doing and Dusty explained.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to draw a pentagram on the floor. I have to make sure that the floor is perfectly clean because if there\u2019s any chance of dirt in the pentagram, you\u2019ll be in a lot of danger, and so will I. Fetch the hoover will you? Don\u2019t take the sheets please,\u201d Dusty called as Ange went to do as she was asked.\n\nOnce the floor was cleared of the carpet and vacuumed thoroughly, Dusty fetched her tankbag from her motorcycle. Inside it was a large black sheet, larger than a double bedsheet, a large container of salt and two candlesticks with candles. She was careful to lay the sheet down on the floor without wrinkles or folds and then she took off her clothes and placed them in a pile in the corner of the room. Ange was a little embarrassed but was becoming far too tired to worry about her best friend\u2019s strange behaviour. Dusty went into the bathroom and took a very quick but thorough shower and came back all clean but with damp hair.\n\nThe sheet had a very faint outline of a circle and a star in the centre of it and Dusty traced the outline in salt. She opened the container and allowed the salt to fall in a steady stream onto the sheet in a perfect circle. Just before the circle was completed, she beckoned Ange to step forward and only completed the circle once she was inside it. Then she drew the star-shape to complete the pentagram. Dusty told Ange to sit down in the middle of the star where there was a large clear patch, free of salt. Then Dusty placed the two candlesticks on either side of Ange and lit the candles. When Ange was comfortable, Dusty stepped out of the pentagram and muttered a lot of words that Ange didn\u2019t recognise. After a short time, Ange didn\u2019t notice that Dusty was speaking words she didn\u2019t understand, she drifted into a very deep and restful sleep, still in the sitting position. \nWhen Ange had dropped to sleep, Dusty picked up her tankbag again and removed a very sharp-looking knife. It would seem to be a ceremonial dagger except that the edge was glinting as it was moved. There was nothing ceremonial about the dagger; it was a weapon and an effective one at that. Dusty was still naked and she opened out the sheets that Ange had stripped from her bed only a few hours before. She folded them so that the majority of the sticky wet mess was on the inside and then sat upon the pile of bedding, she was still naked and she was exceptionally calm. She watched her friend recharge her batteries in a deep and enchanted sleep and she waited.\n\nThe clock on the bedside table that had been taken out to the top of the landing ticked and Dusty could see it from where she sat. The hands were crawling their way towards three a.m. and the Witching Hour. Dusty made herself ready. From the ceiling in one corner a dark patch spread. It looked very much like damp or mould, dark grey with patches of black. From that patch a figure appeared and dropped to the bedroom floor. Dusty recognised it at once.\n\u201cImpundulu, we meet again.\u201d\nThe figure wore his seducing image but Dusty was not fooled by his Glamour. Her eyes were demon\u2019s eyes and she had performed the correct rituals to enable her to see past his enchantment and she saw him in his true form, repulsive and grotesque.\n\u201cDusty the demon hunter, what are you doing here? I do hope that you\u2019ve come to offer me a threesome?\u201d  His words dripped honey and were meant to antagonise her but he tried only in a flippant manner because he realised that she was not going to fall into his traps designed to make her angry and mentally off-balance.\n\u201cI suppose I should have realised that it was you that had come for her. You are by far the most powerful Incubus and I should have guessed that only one so powerful as you could bewitch her and toy with her for so long without killing her.\u201d Dusty played her own game and she was far better at it than Impundulu was. He did not realise that she was flattering him and making him preen and prance in his vanity. He did not realise that she had his scent on her from sitting on the bedsheets and therefore he was attracted to her by the smell. He also did not realise that she had stood for a reason and that reason was not to give him the full view of her trim and supple body but it was to entice him into the bathroom.\n\nImpundulu followed Dusty without a glance at Ange and he sniffed the air as he went across the landing. He was entranced by her swaying hips as she walked slowly and seductively before him. When he had followed her through the bathroom door into the dark room, she pushed it closed and turned to face the Incubus. \u201cNow, Impundulu; watch.\u201d Dusty pulled the light cord and the fluorescent lights illuminated the bathroom. Impundulu did not understand for a moment and his demon eyes were dazzled by the bright light reflecting off the gleaming tiles and the mirror facing him... and the mirror behind him on the back of the bathroom door. He was caught between two mirrors and in them; he could see his image from the front and the back views. He could also see his Glamour image and his true image and he screeched in fury.\n\u201cYou have tricked me you traitorous bitch! You have trapped me!\u201d\n\u201cYes I have and now, I intend to send you back to the hell-hole that spawned you.\u201d She pushed the demon hard in the middle of what passed for a chest and he stumbled backwards towards the mirror on the bathroom door. As he passed through the glass and into the world beyond, his claw reached out and grabbed for Dusty. He could not get a proper grip on her because she had no clothes on but he had grasped for the hand that held the knife and he managed to get purchase on her fist and he desperately clung on, dragging her with him through the mirror and into his world.\n\nHe let her go as he landed on the ash floor, because she had twisted her wrist and the lethal blade had gashed his arm to the bone. As she landed gracefully, she instantly clothed herself in her usual black jeans, black boots, black t-shirt and black leather bike jacket. He was again furious when he realised that she was not a stranger to his world, she was used to the Astral Plane and knew very well how her powers of self-perception worked. \nInstead of attacking her, Impundulu took to his heels and fled deeper into the ravaged lands that he called home, holding his arm and dripping black blood on the surface of the pathway.\nShe could see into the distance where Impundulu was heading and she was in no particular hurry to follow him there. Ange would be safe for a good few hours yet and so Dusty took a look around and got her bearings before making a move.\nShe saw the Ash Desert stretching out interminably to her left and she would rather have followed Impundulu through that harsh and unforgiving landscape than to the Wraith Mountains where he had taken off to.\nSighing, Dusty took to the air and moved upward. Impundulu was visible against the dark red of the ash road; he was a pale and bright thing against the background. She did not understand why he had decided to run rather than fly until she heard the caw of a massive vulture above her. Impundulu had set his familiar on her and it had brought some friends! Dusty looked above her and saw that the vulture was accompanied by hundreds, if not thousands of smaller birds. There was a variation of all shapes and sizes following her but as she watched, her fear melted away because the smaller birds were flying lower than the vulture and they were obscuring the vulture\u2019s view of her. As soon as Dusty was certain that the vulture could not see her for the mass of birds between it and her, she slowed in her flight path and hovered for a while until the birds had all gone past. \nTo be on the safe side, Dusty dropped to the ground and changed the colour of her clothing to a more camouflaged red. Not only would the vulture not be able to spot her from a great distance, neither would Impundulu or any other demons.\nAs she walked, she had time to think on Impundulu and his motives, not to mention his familiar that Dusty had just avoided.\n\nPart 1 here: https://steemit.com/succubus/@michelle.gent/dusty-the-demon-hunter-a-short-story-in-a-few-parts-1\n\nPart 2 here: https://steemit.com/succubus/@michelle.gent/dusty-the-demon-hunter-part-2",

Where are you?\u201d \nDusty went into the kitchen and put her hand on the kettle, it was warm, so Ange had done as she\u2019d been told, but where to find her? \nIt didn\u2019t take long, she was in the living room, slumped on the sofa in front of the TV, her mug of coffee balanced upon her knee but tipping precariously. Dusty took hold of the mug gently and pulled it out of Ange\u2019s grip. Ange woke up at the disturbance and startled herself. She jumped in her shock and Dusty saw the dark smudges under her eyes that told of nights without sleep.\nWhen Ange had got a grip of herself again and Dusty had made them both a fresh mug of coffee, Dusty insisted that Ange tell her everything.\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed though,\u201d Ange complained.\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re also exhausted. This is a new thing, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve just had one bad night; you\u2019ve not slept properly for a week if the coal sacks under your eyes are anything to go by. It\u2019s about time you either told me about it or you went to see the doctor.\u201d\nAnge looked at her friend and sighed. She knew that Dusty was right; the sleepless nights were killing her and would cost her the job she had strived so hard to get. She knew she was lucky to get her dream job right from leaving college and she would do anything to keep it.\nSo Ange bit the bullet and told Dusty everything.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be mad at me, I know you don\u2019t like them, but I went to Bella\u2019s house last weekend, it was supposed to be an erotic lingerie and toy party but the girl that was supposed to come didn\u2019t show up and we\u2019d got all the wine and everything and we didn\u2019t want to give it up as a wasted night so Bella...\u201d Angie paused.\n\u201cGo on, what did Bella do?\u201d Dusty prompted.\n\u201cShe fetched her Ouija board out.\u201d Angie didn\u2019t say any more, she waited for Dusty\u2019s reaction, which didn\u2019t arrive.\nAngie waited for the outburst but Dusty sat in the chair across from her, sipping her coffee and waiting for her to continue, so she continued.\n\u201cWell, it was all very funny to start with, only one girl refused to play with it but we called her chicken until she gave in. I\u2019m not sure we should have goaded her like that because as soon as she touched the plant... the plan... whatchamacallit?\u201d\n\u201cThe planchette.\u201d Dusty helped.\n\u201cYeah that. As soon as she touched it, it started to move.\u201d\n\u201cYou were touching it too?\u201d\n\u201cYes. There was only me and her touching it, the others put their fingers back on it as soon as it started moving.\u201d\n\u201cThen what happened?\u201d Dusty prompted again.\nAnge looked at her friend and tears welled in her eyes. \u201cWhat have we done, Dusty? Have we released something?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. Tell me when your nightmares began.\u201d Dusty put her mug on the table and went to sit at the side of her friend. She didn\u2019t sit too near because she could sense that Ange wasn\u2019t feeling comfortable with the closeness of her. Dusty could wait until Ange did feel comfortable but for the time being, she sat where she was, next to her on the sofa, but not touching.\nAnge looked into her own mug and sighed again. \u201cThe planchette was going crazy, it was whizzing all over the board and we couldn\u2019t tell which letters it was pointing to. Bella was laughing for a bit until the planchette flew off the board and hit her mum\u2019s photo. She got mad at us then and said we\u2019d gone too far. The girl that started it grabbed her coat and left the house. She didn\u2019t take her wine or anything, she just went. I think she ran down the path after she slammed the door. I was a bit scared then. We didn\u2019t throw the planchette, well at least I know I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOK, I\u2019ve got that bit, now, did anything happen that night?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah, as a matter of fact, I think something did. I had a fabulous dream but I can\u2019t remember what it was about. There was a really gorgeous bloke in it and...\u201d Ange stopped speaking because Dusty\u2019s face had taken on an expression that she didn\u2019t like. It scared her because Dusty\u2019s face had gone pale enough to make her dark eyes stand out in sharp contrast and it was quite weird how her eyes seemed to glow in her face. Ange thought that the irises had a red ring around them but Dusty blinked and the effect was gone. Dusty looked pale and worried but Ange assumed that was because she was concerned for her own health.\n\u201cDid you dream that you had sex with this gorgeous bloke?\u201d Dusty asked in a quiet voice.\nAnge\u2019s cheeks grew hot as she blushed. \u201cDusty! What sort of question is that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honest one. Did you dream that you had fantastic sex with him?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes...\u201d\n\u201cAre you on the Pill?\u201d\nAnge\u2019s cheeks had not had time to cool from the previous embarrassing question and they coloured up hotter and redder than before but this time she answered truthfully and immediately.\n\u201cYes I am.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s some good news at least.\u201d Dusty said almost under her breath but Ange heard her.\n\u201cReally, Dusty? I mean, really? You\u2019re happy because I can\u2019t get pregnant by a dream lover?\u201d\n\u201cYes Ange, really. That\u2019s not a dream lover, it\u2019s a nightmare one. You\u2019re being attacked by an Incubus. I don\u2019t know if the Pill will be enough to stop your body from becoming pregnant by the Incubus. My thoughts would suggest that if you can remember to take it, you\u2019ll be ok but if your subconscious takes over and makes you forget to, well then you could be in trouble.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell, Dusty? What are you telling me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you that you\u2019re being attacked by a demon and he wants nothing more than to make you pregnant because if you survive that experience, he\u2019ll have the chance of a semi-demon offspring and that will be no good for you, not at all.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know all of this?\u201d Ange was Dusty\u2019s very best friend, the closest she had and because of that fact, Dusty decided to tell her.\n\u201cI know all of this because my mother was attacked by an Incubus. She was a virgin when it attacked her and she eventually became pregnant. My grandparents were religious and at first wouldn\u2019t believe that she was pregnant but when she started to get a little bump, they realised that it was true. They didn\u2019t believe her that she was a virgin though, not until they had her examined, thoroughly.\u201d Dusty watched Ange\u2019s expression as she took in what Dusty was telling her and the realisation of the type of examination Dusty\u2019s mother had been put through at first shocked and then disgusted her.\n\u201cSo what did your grandparents do then?\u201d\n\u201cWell, they tried, I suppose. They took her to see their minister who offered to bless the pregnancy. Some hope that was. Then they decided to get a proper priest in to do an exorcism and the Incubus showed up for that one. It threw things at them all, it laughed at the ceremony and it assaulted my mum, in front of her parents and that priest. They could all see her clothes being moved around as its hands were all over her. It was very bizarre of course and mum was nearly hysterical. I think that when it pulled her dress up and it became obvious that it was trying to have sex with her on the table that she was lying on, the priest threw holy water on it. I don\u2019t think it did anything really, from what mum told me, but it made it angry enough to slash at the priest\u2019s face before it left.\u201d\n\u201cDid it come back?\u201d\n\u201cNot before I was born but after that, yeah, it came back and it wanted to take me but my mum fought hard for me.\u201d Dusty became solemn then and Ange waited in silence. Dusty\u2019s eyes welled with tears and they appeared to be a lighter shade than they had a few minutes before. \u201cIt killed my mum on my eleventh birthday. It came for me and mum wouldn\u2019t let it have me and instead of being invisible, it appeared to her as it had when it first seduced her. I saw it too. He was so handsome, he was almost beautiful. He had long blonde and wavy hair, his eyes were bright blue and his mouth just asked to be kissed.\u201d Dusty saw Ange\u2019s expression of shock. \u201cYeah, I know but even at eleven I knew that he was gorgeous, but it was a \u2018Glamour\u2019. It wasn\u2019t its real image and mum saw it reflected in the mirror over the fireplace and she threw salt at it.\u201d\n\u201cDoes salt work then?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it may have burned it a bit but it made it angry again. It snapped her neck and then snapped her back and left me alone. I don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t take me with it when it had the chance but my grandparents came round for my birthday party and found me crying over her body. I went to live with them after that.\u201d\n\u201cOh my God Dusty, is it going to kill me?\u201d Ange started to shake but Dusty still didn\u2019t reach out to her.\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not going to die. I won\u2019t let it kill you. I\u2019m going to get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cKill it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t kill it, it\u2019s a demon but I can make it wish it had never thought of choosing my best friend to seduce.\u201d Dusty\u2019s eyes had the red ring around the irises again and this time, Ange didn\u2019t mistake it for her imagination. She saw the sparks dancing in the irises and she knew that her friend was going to kick some Incubus ass! \u201cNow, show me the sheets.\u201d\n\nPart 1 here: https://steemit.com/succubus/@michelle.gent/dusty-the-demon-hunter-a-short-story-in-a-few-parts-1",

He came closer to her slowly so that the tiny hairs on her neck bristled with his nearness before he touched her and her body shuddered deliciously. She was tense with excitement and shaking as he got close enough to touch her with the tips of his fingers. The first touch from him was electric and her skin tingled wherever his feather-light touch stroked. His lips brushed her neck and she closed her eyes and leaned her head back on his broad shoulder. His arms snaked around her and folded her into his embrace. His lips were replaced by his teeth on her tender and sensitive neck and again she shuddered, the nips were gentle yet insistent. \nHis breathing was becoming laboured as his passion rose to match hers and he pressed himself against her. She could feel his excitement and her mouth opened to allow her panting breath an escape route. He stopped nibbling but held his teeth close to her neck and his tongue flicked out between them to tease her earlobe and he listened to her. She was impatient for him to restart his seduction but he knew that he was in complete control and he made her wait.\nHis hand went up to her throat and with his fingernails he gently traced from her chin down... the tension was excruciating and almost beyond her endurance. She wanted to take his hands and place one on her breast and the other between her legs but she seemed unable to control her limbs. Her hands and arms were immobile and a fleeting thought crossed her mind \u201cOh no, not again!\u201d\nWith that thought embedded in her mind and her body unwilling to respond to her commands, his caresses and strokes were perceived differently and they became more invasive and she still could do nothing. Her mind was screaming her protest but her body, her treacherous and lustful body was urging him on!\nAs he laid her down she closed her eyes because she did not wish to see the person that was pleasuring her and yet violating her night after night in her dreams. She knew that he was aware that she was protesting inside her mind. He knew that her free will was locked away in the dream-state. He knew and he took full advantage of her instincts to mate and he laughed. It was a sinister and dark laugh and she cringed from it.\nAs he lowered his body onto her, she gasped for his flesh was ice cold, almost painfully so. She could not move her arms to stop him but it seemed that her legs were under no such restrictions; they wrapped themselves around him. He was the consummate expert in seduction and he controlled himself perfectly. He continued to work his magic upon her and she had no choice in the matter as she was compelled to wrap her suddenly movable arms around his neck to pull her up close to his body. \nThe cold of his skin was still disturbing to her inner mind, she thought that he would have warmed up a little, but no, he was still unnaturally cold and she was still so very hot and she wanted his coldness to douse the fire between her legs and yet she didn\u2019t!\nShe hung onto him with arms and legs squeezing his body until her muscles ached. Her head hung down back toward her pillow but still she did not let go, her arms couldn\u2019t let go, they were not hers to command yet.\nShe was still aching for more of him and she did not want it to end. Her mating instinct had swamped her free will and it was all but silent as her legs pulled her yet closer to his deathly-cold body, her arms crushing her breasts into his chest and her fingers entwining themselves in his hair. The difference in temperature between the two was making condensation on her perspiring body and where they were touching, flesh to flesh began to feel slimy and clammy.\nAs he approached his own end, his body began to change. His skin became coarser, as did his hair. She felt as though she had hold of hanks of horse tail rather than the silky smooth hair of her lover. \nHis skin became scaled and the part of her that was based in reality was repulsed but the dreaming part was striving for more before he released her and left.\nShe was unsatisfied, she felt dirty and defiled even as her body was shuddering with ecstasy. Her body was over the throes of passion as she felt the beginning of his. Her arms became weakened and she flopped back onto the bed. Her legs weakened a moment after but he maintained the connection between them as he did indeed let loose his final shout of passion. She shuddered anew as he grunted his pleasure, and she was more determined than ever to keep her eyes closed tight against the vision of horror that she knew her dream lover had turned into.\nShe turned her head as he planted a kiss on her cheek, his lips were no longer inviting and warm, they were scabbed and cold. He laughed at her grimace and then she knew that he had gone.\nHer bed was saturated with sweat and something cold and sticky that was the residue of the night\u2019s exertions.\nShe was repulsed and disgusted and she stripped her bed for the third time that week.\n\nAfter a fifty minute shower that left her feeling scrubbed but not cleansed, she phoned her best friend, Dusty.\n\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore, I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019ve rung work to say I\u2019m ill three times this week already and they are starting to ask questions. I can\u2019t tell them I\u2019m having nightmares, not at my age, but what can I do?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m coming over; I think this is something I have to see for myself.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be daft, there\u2019s nothing to see...\u201d\n\u201cHave you washed the sheets from your bed?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, not yet, how did you know about the sheets?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a few minutes, get the kettle on.\u201d\n\nPart 2 here: https://steemit.com/succubus/@michelle.gent/dusty-the-demon-hunter-part-2\n\nPart 3 here: https://steemit.com/succubus/@michelle.gent/dusty-the-demon-hunter-part-3",

    "body": "The creature screamed and stood to its full height, or almost. It was impossible under the eight foot ceilings in the jail.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/c8fe81a2e8.jpg)\nAll that stood between us and a full-grown sasquatch was a row of iron rebar, welded into a grid, with squares a little smaller than a man\u2019s head. \n\nThe smell was overwhelming, as the thing beat its chest with massive arms and showed a row of yellowed teeth. It\u2019s blood-orange eyes, bored right through us. \n\n\u201cJack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Phil?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext time you think it\u2019ll be funny to apply for a research grant\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n**\u201cGo screw yourself, man. I think I just wet my pants.\u201d**\n\n*In the cell behind us, two furry shadows, about the size of a chimpanzee, each, seemed to be laughing. Their mother was now gripping the bars on the front of our cell. As far as she was concerned, the only way to her babies, was through the space we were currently occupying.* \n\nLess than two weeks earlier on the campus of OCCC community college in Oklahoma City\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u201cJack Bannister,\u201d I sat up. My biology professor had just dropped my latest paper on the desk in front of me and woke me up. The lecture hall was nearly empty already, how long had I been out? I looked  down at the paper a large F was circled at the top. I sighed, this wasn\u2019t good. \n\n\u201cThat was a brilliant piece of fiction, Jack. Consider applying to the film program, they\u2019re looking for screenwriting majors,\u201d he moved to the next student. \n\n\u201cPhillip  Johnson, well done as always, see you beautiful people tomorrow,\u201d he called after us as we exited. \n\n\u201cJack, if you don\u2019t pass biology, there will be no transfer next semester, you get that right?\u201d Phillip said, grabbing my arm. \n\n**\u201cYes mom, look, I\u2019ll just drop the class and keep it off my transcript,\u201d I said.** \n\n\u201cWhat? Do you actually pay attention to anything? If you drop that, there\u2019s not enough credits on your transcript, no more financial aid, no more school until you get the money to pay the bill\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d I said, slapping him on the chest as I brushed past him, snatching a notice from the \u2018Science Opportunities\u2019 billboard. \n\n\u201cBrilliant idea, Phil, brilliant! Look, here\u2019s your money right here!\u201d \n\n*I turned the paper to face him and he took it, reading, \u201cInternational Fellowship of Sasquatch Researchers grant application? Are you freaking serious? This is not legit, man. And if  it  was, you wouldn\u2019t get it.\u201d*\n\n\u201cWanna bet?\u201d\n\nOver the next 24 hours, I became as much of a bigfoot expert as I could, consuming over 12 hours of \u201cDiscovery Channel\u201d documentaries, searching dozens of websites and watching another 2 hours of Youtube footage. \n\n**I could do this.** \n\n> Pause for just a moment. If I had been able to see into the future to\n> see exactly where this all was going to lead, it\u2019s doubtful I would\n> have been so cavalier, but who knows? You only live once, right?\n\n\u201cOkay, here\u2019s the plan. We set up a camera, create a Vlog, back date the whole thing and put together a resume. We take some selfies in places that look like bigfoot country, write a few blog posts and send in the application. With my writing abilities and your\u2026pessimistic attitude, we\u2019re perfect.\u201d I told Phil.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your project?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe project, you have to have a project you want funded with the grant, what\u2019s it going to be?\u201d Phillip asked smugly, sure I\u2019d missed this detail. \n\n**\u201cWe\u2019re going to Honobia,\u201d** \n\nI said, booting up my tablet and clicking on a tab way in the back as a webpage popped up. \u201cWe\u2019re going to shoot the Bigfoot conference.\u201d\n\nThe next day we had a response. They wanted a telephone interview. I was a finalist for the grant. \n\n\u201cThis is not going to work,\u201d Phillip said, \u201cYou fooled them with a fake Vlog, now you think you can pass yourself off as one of them?\u201d \n\n*We were in the commons when the call came, at least six kids I didn\u2019t know were waiting to listen in. I turned on speakerphone and set my phone on a table.* \n\n\u201cHello, Jack Bannister?\u201d the voice on the other end sounded tough, and spoke with a twang that wreaked of backwoods. \n\n\u201cYes, sir that\u2019s me,\u201d I replied, trying to match his tone. \n\n*\u201cWell, this here is Petey, wit the IFSR, we\u2019re calling about the application for our grant money.  I got Wilkes here with me, listening in,  we\u2019re the grant committee and we were very impressed with your application, there*.\u201d \n\n\u201cThank you sir, so what else would you like to know?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot too much, I reckon. So, you got a team to cover Honobia? We\u2019d love to see it dun right.\u201d\n\n**\u201cUh, yeah, team, they\u2019re listening in right now. My roommate, Phil is my uh\u2026\u201d I looked to Phil.**\n\n\u201cDP, uh, director of photography,\u201d he whispered. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the DP, you know, directory of photography and we have an audio guy,\u201d I covered the phone, \u201cWho here can do foley?\u201d six hands shot up. \u201cReally? Who knows what I just freaking said?\u201d one hand remained up, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cCarlos Mendez,\u201d he said. He looked serious and he was carrying a digital recording rig, \u201cIs this a paying gig?\u201d\n\n\u201cCarlos  Mendez, on foley for our audio, and we\u2019re really excited to get down there and, uh , get this thing in the can,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cIs it paying?\u201d Carlos hissed. \n\n**\u201cWell, you got yourself a grant young man. We wuz thinking we  could just PayPal the money, that work?\u201d Petey said.** \n\n\u201cUh, yeah, how soon do you think that would be, we\u2019re needing to rent some uh, some gear\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this here your PayPal email what you sent the application from?\u201d Petey asked. \n\n\u201cYes, yes sir, it is,\u201d I replied, holding my breath. \n\n**There were sounds of clicking on a keyboard, \u201cDammit, Wilkes, you spill tobacco on my keyboard agin? The damn enter key is stickin. There, you got it\u2026now. We look forward to hearing from you.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cWait, what? That\u2019s it? Uh, okay, so when do we check in?\u201d I said, trying to sound professional enough to not get the charges reversed instantly.**\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch, wunce you got sumthin,\u201d Petey said. \n\n\u201cHow will you know?\u201d I asked. \n\n**Petey chuckled, \u201cCryptozoology is a pretty tight knit community, we\u2019ll know.\u201d** \n\nThere was silence, \u201cHello?\u201d A dial tone erupted from the speaker, followed by a ping. \n\nI picked up my phone and the whole room collectively held its breath, as I checked my email, \u201cHoly crap! It\u2019s there, Phil, I just got a grant to make a movie about something that doesn\u2019t even exist, for $10,000.00 dollars!\u201d\n\n*Everyone in the commons cheered. People were stopping to stare, poking their heads out of doors. Students, who had heard the story, were informing total strangers, everyone was smiling except for Phil.* \n\n\u201cDo you know what you just did?\u201d he swallowed.\n\n\u201cYeah, I just got $10k for making a movie, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\n\n****\u201cYou just signed a contract with the Little Dixie Mafia to make a scam movie for 10 grand,\u201d he said quietly. He looked so pale I thought he might pass out.** \n\n\u201cDude, lighten up, they are just a bunch of ignorant rednecks, it\u2019s fine. Come on, we got a movie to make man!\u201d \n\n*By five PM that night, I had a list of 25 film students begging to crew my movie. I didn\u2019t know what we would do with them all but Phil, who had finally come around, said sell them a producer credit, since that\u2019s what they needed anyway, was resume credit. So, I did who knew so many of them would go for it?* \n\n\u201cMan, do you know how much money is here?\u201d Phil said, sweating. \n\n\u201cYeah, over $12k, man, this might just turn out to be a legit thing,\u201d I replied. \n\nPhil, huffed, \u201cYou\u2019re still not getting it, this has got to be meth money, and the guys who sent you that $10,000.00 don\u2019t mess around, Jack. My uncle was a sheriff deputy in McCurtain county and I am telling you, you don\u2019t want to scam these guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, so, we go to the festival, pick up some ideas on a bigger story, and make a real movie,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cThe one thing you may know even less about than the Little Dixie Mafia is film making.\u201d\n\n**I smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s why I have you Phil,\u201d I said hugging him.** \n\n\u201cGet off me, dude, I have a girlfriend,\u201d he said, \u201cbesides, highschool AV club and a couple of summer film camps did not prepare me to manage a $12,000.00 production budget. Look, if you want me in on this, you\u2019re doing it my way,\u201d Phil said. \n\n\u201cFine with me, all I really wanted was to pay for school, and that is covered.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, no, not it\u2019s not. We can\u2019t touch this money except for film expenses until we have something to show for it!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole reason I started this, what do you mean, no? There\u2019s plenty. How much can a film cost?\u201d\n\n*Phil Just laughed.* \n\n**The next morning, my account balance was $700.00.**\n\n\u201cWhat the hell? Where did all of the money go?\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, the investment capital, by law, has to be held in escrow until it\u2019s spent on expenses, so I moved it. The rest we spent on equipment, a van and a trailer,\u201d Phil informed me. \n\n\u201cOkay, so when do we go pick it out?\u201d \n\n\u201cPick what out?\u201d Phil asked. \n\n\u201cThe van, the gear?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rental package, there\u2019s no picking it out,\u201d Phil said. \n\n\u201cSo, you mean we spent $12,000.00 and after this is over I don\u2019t even get a cool camera?\u201d I was starting to regret inviting Phil. \n\n**The doorbell rang, on the step was an Amazon package.** \n\n\u201cCool, it\u2019s here already!\u201d Phil said, taking the package  and slicing it open. \n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d \n\n\u201cThe camera you wanted,\u201d he said, pulling a Go Pro with a head mount out of the box. \u201cHere, play with this.\u201d\n\n*I did, and by the time we were ready to load up, we had also acquired three body cams, that we intended to wear throughout the entire experience. We picked up the van and trailer the day before and unbolted the back seats to make room for an air mattress, at Phil\u2019s suggestion, in case we needed to camp in the van, leaving enough room for up to 6 passengers.* \n\n\u201cWe need a line producer,\u201d I insisted, consulting my \u2018film for dummies\u2019 guide to make sure I was using the right term. \n\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t, that\u2019s the same as a script supervisor and only happens on dramatic films, \u201c Phil answered. \n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t care what we call her, but she is coming,\u201d I said, holding up my phone to show Phil the hopelessly hot girl who had been begging for days to be included. \n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, a group of about 50 students were in the parking lot at the college when we rolled in to load out the rest of the camera  gear into the trailer. Considering it was 5 am and this was a commuter school, that was impressive. \n\n*Our fans had taken to social media over the planning period and so far, we had over 200 signed up to receive notifications every time we \u201cwent live\u201d on Facebook. I had to admit, fame felt nice. While Phil went in with Carlos to check out the gear, I stayed behind to guard the van and by the time they had the last case in the trailer and had slapped the padlock shut, there were more than a hundred students, and miscellaneous Sasquatch fans milling around, a few even had banners.* \n\nBefore Phil could stop me, I had scrambled to the top of the van, \u201cHello, Oh Triple C!\u201d I yelled into the morning air, and got a roar back from the crowd. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re off to solve one of life\u2019s final mysteries and bring you real footage of the hairy man himself, Sasssssquaaaatch!\u201d They cheered. \n\n*Somewhere in the back of the crowd, someone was holding up a giant Sasquatch cutout from a beef jerkey company promotion. They crowd surfed it up to the van, with a sharpie attached and I signed Sasquatch\u2019s face and sent him back.* \n\nI\u2019d left the driver\u2019s door open and made my exit gracefully, sliding into what I thought would be an empty driver\u2019s seat, only to end up in Phil\u2019s lap, \u201cDude, I\u2019m driving.\u201d\n\n\u201cDude, I signed the insurance paperwork, no you\u2019re not,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cCome on, just scoot over and let me pull out of here, my fans expect it,\u201d I pleaded. \n\nPhil stopped thumbing in our destination on his Iphone and sighed. \n\n\u201cFine, but we\u2019re pulling into the Circle K, you got me?\u201d\n\n\u201cCopy that, Captain!\u201d I stood  up on the running board, waving to the fans, as Phil moved into the passenger seat and Carlos buckled into the front bench seat. \u201cBigfoot or Bust!\u201d I screamed and rolled my window down, as we cruised out of the parking lot to cheers. \n\n**\u201cAll right, pull over,\u201d Phil said.** \n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m driving,\u201d I laughed. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Phil said. \n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d I replied, \u201cin fact it looks painful!\u201d\n\n*Phil reached across and grabbed the wheel, threatening to throw the van into park. I let go, and laughed, \u201cOops, you\u2019re over the line there buddy, would you like to let me drive, wreck this thing before we even get off campus?\u201d*\n\nHe rolled his eyes and set up, stiffly, as I retook the wheel and stepped on the gas. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a child,\u201d Phil said. \n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t changed since you met me in third grade,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\n**We pulled into our campsite at dusk.** \n\n*It might have been sooner, but Phil fell asleep and we were in Gainesville, before I realized my mistake. The campground was down a dirt road. The photos must have been a few decades past, because the \u201cgeneral store\u201d was now a pile of ashes, the pool was a rusty, empty hole, filled with broken furniture and the office looked like a reject from \u201cfixer uppers\u201d. But, the water was fine, the shower was hot and our tent was up before dark.* \n\nThat night, we shot a bit of \u201cBlair Witch\u201d footage, with Carlos and Phil in the tent, pretending our camp was being marauded, while I, with the best \u201cBigfoot\u201d voice, slapped the tent around and growled. \n\nTo make Phil happy, I insisted we would only be using it as Youtube footage for our fans, but I fully intended to see it in the movie. Little did I know. \n\n**We settled in,  cooked dinner and took turns in the pay shower, having just enough quarters for all three of us to get a 5 minute hot shower.** \n\nWhen Phil came out of the shower, it was dark, he found that his clothes were missing, and a mysterious large, wet footprint was clearly visible where his clothes had been. As I joined in the search, Carlos donned a Sasquatch mask I had brought for just such an occasion and waited around the corner in the direction the footprint indicated. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not too sure about this, Phil,\u201d I said. \u201cI was in the crapper the whole time and Carlos is back at the tent man, what if that\u2019s real?\u201d \n\n**Phil swung his maglight up into my eyes, temporarily blinding me, \u201cNonsense, Jack, I know your handiwork when I see it. Get my clothes back, now!\u201d**\n\nI shook my head no, with my best leery expression, \u201cHell no, I heard something rummaging back there and I\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Pete\u2019s sake!\u201d he said, \u201cFine! I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d \n\nOn about the second step, Phil tripped on his towel but proceeded into the darkness, my bodycam catching glimpses of his white ass as he hustled around the corner. I scrambled to catch up. \n\n\u201cRRRRAAAAAAHHH!\u201d Carlos bellowed, clawing sightlessly, inside the huge mask, with foam rubber Bigfoot claws as he met Phil coming around the corner into the dark.  He managed to connect, knocking Phil\u2019s glasses from his face. \n\n*Now, there is something that happens to a person not used to the out-of-doors when they make contact with an unknown creature in the dark. As rational as Phil was, in that moment, he genuinely believed he was encountering a living Skunk Ape in it\u2019s natural habitat. He went a little crazy.* \n\nPhil jumped back, dropping his flashlight. Then it seemed, he decided that turning his back on a potential carnivore twice his size was a bad idea and the two squared off, neither able to see the other clearly. \n\n**\u201cShit!\u201d Phil said and I considered stepping in, since Phil never cusses, but it was too late.** \n\n*As Carlos stepped toward him, stomping, bowlegged, in the giant bigfoot feet, Phil launched a kick, straight out in front of him that connected squarely with Carlos\u2019 family jewels and lifted him a full six inches off the ground.* \n\nAs Carlos fell backward into the mud we\u2019d created to take the imprint of the bigfoot shoes , Phil launched himself, stark naked on top of him. \n\n*\u201cI got one! I got one!\u201d they rolled in the mud for a minute, Phil undoing the last hot shower we had quarters for. Meanwhile, I\u2019d managed to get the Go Pro rolling and was torn between laughing and already regretting what was coming next as I filmed the entire incident.* \n\nAfter about thirty seconds of grappling, Carlos broke free and limped off around the corner of the bathhouse, howling, for all the world, like a legitimate giant primate in excruciating pain. Lights moved toward us from every corner of the campground. \n\nPhil, meanwhile, found his glasses, right where he had stepped on them, nearly broken in the center. I went to find his towel, which by  now, he\u2019d completely forgotten about. So when the first campers arrived with a camping lantern, he was revealed in all his mud covered glory, glasses askew and hair spiked up with silt and grass. \n\n\u201cWell, hell,\u201d said one older woman, \u201cThat\u2019s not even a very convincing costume! Their peckers are bigger than that!\u201d\n\n\u201cIda Mae, how would you know?\u201d asked her husband.\n\n**\u201cWell, John,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s not something you forget.\u201d**\n\n*\u201cUm, er, excuse me,\u201d Phil said, snatching up a hairy bigfoot glove from the ground to cover himself with, looking down at it in confusion. I wrapped the towel around him and hustled him back into the bathhouse where another camper took pity on him and funded another round of hot water.* \n\nI made the glove disappear and went to check on Carlos, who I found writhing in agony in his tent, a package of frozen hotdogs covering his groin. \u201cYou okay, buddy?\u201d\n\nHe responded angrily in Spanish. I never knew what he was saying, but it was something about going home, I gathered later when his uncle, who lived nearby,  showed up in a rusty Ford truck to take him back to the city, walking like a donut with a bite out of it. He rolled over the side of the truck bed into the back, and lay there, on a 5  pound sack of ice, eyes barely open. \n\n**\u201cI\u2019ll send you your pay,\u201d I said. He replied in Spanish, and I\u2019m pretty sure it was my first death threat. It wouldn\u2019t be my last.** \n\n\u201cDos veces,\u201d his uncle said, holding up two fingers, then folding one of them down to leave just the middle one. \"You pay twice,\" he paused, making sure I got the message, before getting into the truck. \n\n*He had indeed earned double pay, but the Youtube video I\u2019d captured alone would pay that! I laughed.* \n\nWhen I caught up with Phil, he was retelling his harrowing tale around a campfire, while several veteran Squatch hunters prepared to enter the surrounding woods in search of the beast. \n\n\u201cThis is just like him,\u201d one man said, \u201csomehow he shows up during the festival every damn year. You\u2019d think one of these times we catch him on camera. Hey, Jack, right? Did you get him with yours?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I lied. \u201cIt happened too fast.\u201d \n\nThe conference hadn\u2019t even started yet and already I had enough footage to make the money back, I thought. \n\n**What we would experience over the next week would change everything.**\n \n## Look for the upvote button below.

Pages that I never remember visiting, but, printed out after finding them in my browser history.* \n\nI opened the window a crack, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust checking up on you man. Haven\u2019t seen you in a bit, feeling any better?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d I coughed. That coupled with the fact that my eyes were blurry, red, and puffy from almost total lack of sleep and the rash I was developing from wearing the same clothes must have sold him. \n\n**He looked convinced.** \n\n\u201cOkay, well, we\u2019re almost out of cat food. I won\u2019t be able to walk Ralph tomorrow, or change the litter boxes. I have to visit my mom,\u201d he said, looking worried. \u201cHey, you haven\u2019t seen my essential almond oil have you? In a small glass vial.\u201d\n\nMy mind raced, great. He wouldn\u2019t be here, and I had to face them alone. I couldn\u2019t just let them die, after all, even if they were part of a conspiracy to end humanity. \n\nI shuddered, \u201cUm, no. I haven\u2019t seen it. Okay, I\u2019ll PayPal you some money for the cat food and don\u2019t worry about Ralph. I'll be fine. Thanks.\u201d I pulled the blind closed, before he could say anything else. \nIt was probably best if he wasn\u2019t here. \n\n**He was probably in danger.** \n\n*I turned back to my room, which was starting to look like a sniper\u2019s nest. My childhood pellet gun was propped against the headboard. I had a five-gallon  bottle of drinking water, and several empty gallon jugs filled with\u2026*\n\nThere was a bark at the door and scratching. This might be it, the attack I'd been expecting. I looked up to the air conditioning vent, over the bedroom door. That was where I figured the attack would come from. \n\n*Petey, the parakeet, could easily fit through there and deliver a fatal dose of poison while I slept. It was covered in cardboard, held in place with duct tape. The room was warm and beginning to stink because of it.* \n\nI crawled behind the bed, then stood up where they couldn\u2019t see my feet from under the door. I retrieved the pellet gun and pumped it up. The scratching stopped. The vent blockade held. \n\n**I would survive this time, but how much longer?** \n\nIf I was going down, it was going to be documented. I needed video gear, and I knew just where to find it, Ludwig\u2019s closet. \n\n*When he\u2019d first moved in he\u2019d said, \u201cDude, whatever I have is yours to use, just be sure you take care of it, and put it back where it goes.\u201d I waited until he went to work.* \n\nHe must have had a dozen cameras, each with its own tripod. There was lighting gear, and some stuff I didn\u2019t recognize. Finally, in a box in a corner, I found the perfect solution, a body camera. It was motion sensitive and could record up to 48 hours of \u201carchival quality\u201d footage. \n\n**Which, I figured, meant crappy, but it would work. Now it was time to find out what they were up to.** \n\nAfter the first night, it was a ritual, put the laptop to sleep and move it to a new hiding place. Every morning, it would be back on the breakfast table, open, with the screen saver up. \n\nBut no matter how smart my pets were; they couldn\u2019t grasp the intricacies of history recovery, so I\u2019d managed to retrace their every step. \n\n - Worldwidehits.pup\n - Wild4hits.pup\n - OrchestratingViralHits.cat\n - And my favorite, TheLeagueofDomesticatedAnimals.org\n\nThe sites were filled with webcam video of domestic pets engaged in communicating with each other. Of course, I couldn\u2019t tell what they were saying. \n\n*Most of it looked like Youtube cat videos, which made me wonder, how long had the pets of the world been plotting their takeover? Were they mind controlling us into making these videos and posting them?*\n\nAs best as I could figure, my pets were out to destroy me. What I didn\u2019t know yet, was why. So, I\u2019d put a sign on my bedroom door, claiming illness and asking Ludwig to walk the dog and change the litter boxes. \n\n**I'm sick, stay out for your own health. Please feed the animals and walk Ralph, oh, and empty the litter boxes, thanks!**\n\n*I hadn\u2019t been into the main part of the apartment, with the exception of first thing every morning to retrieve the computer and feed my animals, and a few late-night  visits to the bathroom.* \n\nI\u2019d been entering and exiting through my window, up the fire escape to the roof and down the main stairs of the building, six flights to the street. \n\nOutside the ring of website printouts on my floor, was another layer of discarded paper, mostly made up of fast food wrappers and cups. I couldn\u2019t eat anything that had set in the apartment, that much was clear. \n\n**It was likely all poisoned.** \n\nI\u2019d found out a few things. A kid in my building had supplied a red thumb drive that allowed me to track every keystroke. He got it from a guy who worked in the bodega on the corner, and he used it to hack Wifi whenever his mom couldn\u2019t pay the bill.  \n\n*He said whoever it was, using my computer, was using a virtual keyboard, through Bluetooth, similar to what a paralyzed patient might use. They were typing by focusing, one letter at a time. I hadn\u2019t told him about the animals yet.* \n\nThe virtual keyboard used the webcam to scan their visual patterns, and I assume was  adapted for animal usage. A group of video clips I\u2019d recovered showed Ralph calibrating the software, which was hidden in a secret, password protected drive the thumbdrive had located and gate crashed on the first night. \n\n**These animals were using the computer\u2019s retinal scanner. They must have been.** \n\nIt seemed they were working for hire and got paid in bitcoin, but what were they doing with it? I had no idea. I\u2019d found an account labeled, \u201cWreckitRalph\u201d on a bitcoin exchange, and a Coinbase wallet with a balance that made me lose my breath a bit. \n\nWhat had they done to earn this kind of funding? How many bodies were already strewn in their wake?\n\nMy forensics expert from Craigslist, who had assured me, after $300 in testing, that the bottle did indeed contain pure cyanide in a liquid form, had told me to be careful. \n\n**He handled a lot of contract work for the police and saw all kinds of bodies turn up every day.**  \n\n*I couldn\u2019t trust official channels. Not after the last time. He\u2019d provided a printout of his test results, and it was added to my evidence wall. No one could accuse me of not doing my homework this time.* \n\n\nI stepped carefully over my printouts to the wall and taped another image to my web. In the center was a printout of Benedict Cumberbatch, from a picture I\u2019d gotten on my phone. Surrounding him, with strings running out, connecting each image, were my pets. \n\nThen animals I\u2019d found in common on all the sites they\u2019d been visiting, especially those they had messaged, or commented on posts from. This latest one brought the total up to 78 hitmen in their league. \n\n**Before I\u2019d discovered the LDA resistance on the Conspiracy Infowarrior Forum, I\u2019d really thought this was all in my head.** \n\nHowever, several forum members had confirmed my photos and were finding other connections too. They\u2019d been excited by my finding the bitcoins. It was the last piece in their puzzle. They claimed the League of Domesticated Animals went back millennia, through the richest and most powerful families in the world. \n\n*Then there was Lenny, the pet psychic. He psychically tapped into my pets remotely, using my address. He\u2019d confirmed what I\u2019d suspected, Benedict Cumberbatch was the mastermind, not just of the conspiracy inside my own apartment, but the larger globalist agenda of the League. His was a dark soul.* \n\nI could almost feel his malevolence after doing some meditation techniques Lenny had given me to tap into their collective psyche. He\u2019d thrown in his entire PDF library, and only charged me for the $200 consultation, because he thought this was a real issue and his research might help. \n\nAfter reading his EBook, \u201cHow to be Your Pet\u2019s Best Psychic Advocate\u201d I\u2019d almost made a break through with Ralph. After chanting his name, tantrically for almost an hour,  I could feel his spirit shifting, as he sat outside the door whining, then got peaceful. I was so close to recovering him from the brainwashing the League had put in place, when the mailman showed up at the apartment door, and Ralph had to go and bark at him. \n\n**I could feel his reluctance to leave, but his instincts overpowered me.**  \n\nThat night, I slept. I had to. It had been nearly four days since I\u2019d closed my eyes for more than thirty minutes. My dreams were disturbing. I could feel Max, Ralph, Penelope and Petey reaching out to me. \n\n> But just when I was about to herd them through my room onto the fire escape, Benedict, burst from his bowl, flooded the apartment and charged down the hall.  He was fifty times his normal size, his eyes  blazing with dark psychic power, just as Lenny had described it. He  rode a swell of water, creating a tidal wave that swept me out through  the window. My pets left behind in the clutches of a ruthless, worldwide web of house pet assassins with a goldfish as their mastermind.\n\n*When I woke  up, the bed was soaked, and at first I thought it had been more than a dream. After discovering that 4 of the 5 gallons of water from the bottle I\u2019d had set up on my end table, was missing, I knew what had happened. Somehow, one of them had penetrated my security, tipped the jug while I was sleeping and attempted to drown me.* \n\n**I looked up, and sure enough, the cardboard that had formerly been securely taped over the AC vent was now flapping in the breeze.**\n\nThe cold air was sending me into near hypothermia as I shivered in my soaked clothes. Maybe that was part of their evil plot! It was time to fight back. I checked the clock. It was ten after 5, I\u2019d have to wait until Ludwig left for the train to visit his mother at 7. \n\nFortunately for me, the crowd at the Infowarrior forum was way ahead of me in their preparations. After expressing my concern about falling prey to Benedict's obviously superior mind control skills, they\u2019d suggested a supplier of RFID and high frequency blocking clothing. \n\n**I could purchase a hat with a wire mesh running through the fabric, designed to prevent any type of radio frequency, or psychic attacks.** \n\nThe delivery of my \u201cbattle helmet\u201d as I was calling it, had been the mail that interrupted my deprogramming of Ralph the day before. I\u2019d managed to retrieve it later at around 1 am, while most of the animals slept. \n\n*Petey, the parakeet, normally tucked under a blanket and quiet at night had given me away, however, spotting me from his cage and sounding the alarm.* \n\nRalph was  the first to respond, laying down a layer of slime on the wood floor, just outside the hallway, in an epic shower of toilet bowl drool, snot and saliva that sent me sprawling flat on my back. \n\n**While Max went for my jugular, rubbing and purring, to distract me while he extended his claws, Penelope took a bite out of my leg.** \n\n*In hindsight, this may have been due to my pants pocket being filled with salted peanuts, in the shell, which she loves.* \n\nMeanwhile, my package, which I had thrown in my attempt to regain my balance, had landed somewhere in the living room. Ralph had retrieved and deposited it on the table, directly in front of Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s bowl. \n\nI had a choice, retreat to my room before they could carry out whatever devious plan came next, or face the fish and collect the hat that could very well be the salvation of the human race. \n\nI stared across my living room, meeting Benedict\u2019s cold, fishy glare. The moonlight filtering in through the windows, struck the bowl, illuminating it in an eerie glow as he hung there, motionless, perfectly suspended in the exact center of the bowl. \n\n**I\u2019d always wondered how he managed it. Now, I imagined he\u2019d learned it from some Koi Zen master in whatever Thai backwater, Ludwig had collected him from in his travels of the Orient.** \n\nIf I was going to win this one, I\u2019d need food. Not for me, but to distract his minions, and I knew just the thing. I limped into the kitchen. I reached into the back of the pantry and dug to the very back of the top shelf. \n\nMy fingers located two tins of smoked sardines in mustard sauce. They had been lying in wait for just such an occasion since I had received them three years ago in the bottom of a basket I\u2019d ended up with at the company White Elephant gift exchange. \n\n*I pulled the tab on both cans and as the pungent aroma filled the apartment, I could almost hear Ralph drooling. Max was already rubbing against my legs in anticipation. I had to separate them from Benedict before I could risk a direct confrontation.* \n\nHobbling as quickly as I could, I made it to the bathroom and turned to find that Penelope\u2019s curiosity had gotten the better of her too, three sets of eyes glowed at me from the bathroom door, Ralph\u2019s stomach emitting a low rumble. \n\nI hopped onto the toilet and dropped the two cans into the bathtub. Ralph and Max raced each other to be the first to taste this delectable smell, and I leaped over them, gained safe footing on the hallway carpet and shut the door, trapping them inside the bathroom. \n\n**Now for Petey.** \n\nPenelope had managed to escape the bathroom and followed me, watching my every move as I hurtled down the hallway, forgetting my limp as I vaulted over the back of the sofa, grabbing the blanket I kept there for TV watching as I soared past it. \n\n*I twisted an ankle, as one foot landed on the corner of the coffee table coming down.* \n\nThe pain sent a surge of adrenaline through my body. Petey was screaming and I could feel Benedict\u2019s piercing Psychic attack, pounding like pulses of high pitched static, as I swept the blanket up and over my head, shrouding the bird, who fell silent. \n\n**It was now or never. I turned to face my malevolent piscine adversary.** \n\nOnly one of us was going to survive the final showdown. I advanced toward his bowl, using Lenny\u2019s patented Mindblock breathing technique as I went. I knew that if I let my guard down for just a second, it would be too late. \n\n*I reached for the fireplace poker, afraid to venture any closer. I knocked the mailing envelope, holding my new, anti-mind control cap into the floor and dragging it toward me. The pain from the psychic bombardment was almost overwhelming.* \n\nAs I limped back to my bedroom in retreat, I could hear Ralph whining at the bathroom door, but it was all I could do to drag myself to the safety of my bedchamber and shut the door, just in time to prevent Penelope\u2019s entrance. \n\n**At precisely 7:01, I heard the apartment door shut, as Ludwig left for his train, as he did every Sunday.** \n\nI checked myself in the mirror. I had pulled on the cap, it\u2019s wire mesh layer concealed within the fashion-forward  poplin, but I could feel that it was working. \n\nI added an extra wrap of duct tape at the cuffs of my hoody and the bottoms of my jeans, and donned the heppa filter dust mask I\u2019d found in the top of my closet, with some old remodeling supplies. \n\nThen, I pulled on the white paper painter\u2019s suit and a pair of clear, plastic goggles, the kind that seal at the sides, like a diver\u2019s mask. Heisenberg, I thought, chuckling. That goldfish would never know what hit him.  \n\n*As a final touch, I pushed in foam earplugs, which in retrospect, is probably why I didn\u2019t hear Ludwig come into the apartment in the middle of operation flush Benedict. I grabbed my pellet rifle, shouldered an old hockey stick, also from the closet, and shoved the handle of a small dip net into the hip pocket of the painter\u2019s suit.* \n\n**Everything seemed to move in slow motion as I left the bedroom.** \n\nThe bathroom door was closed, meaning Ralph and Max were still under control. I\u2019d only have Penelope and the fish to worry about. I moved down the hall, hugging the wall and peered around the corner into the living room. \n\nBenedict was swimming laps, and Penelope was nowhere to be seen. \n\nDip net in hand, I approached the goldfish bowl and was just about to drop the net into the water, when I felt my knees give out under 200 pounds of solid mastiff. \n\nAs he rolled into me, Ralph\u2019s whipped his leash up and around my neck, catching there, so that when he bounded back across the room to Ludwig, he dragged me with him. These animals would stop at nothing to end my life!\n\n**Ludwig reached down and helped me up, his  lips were moving, but I couldn't hear him.**\n\n*In his brainwashed state, it was probably for the best, he'd just try to talk me out of what had to be done. He looked shocked as I knocked him cold with a right cross from the hockey stick I still held tightly clutched in my hand. *\n \nWhen Ludwig came to, sitting on the sofa, bound with duct tape and gagged, he was understandably pissed, but I was ready to explain. With the laptop open on the coffee table, I revealed all of my evidence, step by step, building my case for the assassination of Benedict Cumberbatch. \n\n**I showed him the videos, the bodycam footage, the forum posting, the photos.** \n\n*I explained to him how the psychic jamming hat worked, and how he was currently under the influence of a very powerful psychic goldfish, so I understood if this all seemed a little extreme to him.* \n\nI brought out the cyanide bottle, and showed him the bitcoin account, and just as I was about to suggest he try Lenny\u2019s mind-control-block breathing technique, my phone chimed. I pulled it out. \n\n**\u201cYou have a PayPal money request from WreckitRalph@zmail.com\u201d it read.** \n\nI looked at the screen in disbelief, \u201cYou\u2019re Wreck it Ralph?\u201d I said. \n\n*Ludwig nodded vigorously. It was all starting to come together. The late night tv, the animals seeming love for him. He was the grand conspirator. He\u2019d probably trained Benedict in mind control; it was him the bitcoin was all going to. This made so much more sense now. He had to be stopped.* \n\n**I grabbed the pellet rifle and pumped it as hard as I could.** \n\nI\u2019d heard once that if you put a pellet through a man\u2019s eye at a point-blank range, it would penetrate through to the brain and instant death. \n\n*I knew that meant life in prison, but I couldn\u2019t let this go on any further. If the League was allowed to continue, who knew how long the human race had left?* \n\nI steadied the rifle with my right hand, while my left moved to the gag in Ludwig\u2019s mouth, \u201cOkay, Ludwig, I\u2019m going to execute you. You shouldn\u2019t feel a thing, do you have any last words?\u201d \n\n*As the tape peeled away, Ludwig let out a sigh, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to avoid thinking you were crazy, but this takes the cake. Yes, I\u2019m Wreck it Ralph! Did you honestly think a mastiff, a gray tabby and a mini lop were taking orders from a maniacal goldfish to destroy the human race? You know what? Forget it, just shoot me.\u201d*\n\n\u201cWell, when you say it like that...\"\n\n\u201cIt sounds crazy? It is! Look, those accounts aren\u2019t about animal hitmen you idiot. They're my video  channels. It\u2019s how I make my living! The bitcoin? I convert that to pay my rent, buy gas, make my car payment. The crime procedurals are part of my writing research, I write detective novels and that cyanide your idiot friend tested? It\u2019s essential almond oil for my psoriasis, \u201c Ludwig said. \n\n**I sat heavily on the coffee table. I had made a series of very bad assumptions.**\n\n*There was one thing that still didn\u2019t make sense, \u201cWait, if this is your business, why were you running it from my laptop?\u201d*\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your laptop, you idiot! It's mine! And I don\u2019t appreciate you hiding it from me in a different place every night! Untape me. Now! This is ridiculous.\u201d  \n\nAs Ludwig spoke, he freed himself. \u201cYou know what? Forget it. You can have the bitcoin. You can have the laptop, and keep the almond oil. I don\u2019t need a place to live this bad. I can stay with my mom until I sort it out, but what I cannot do is stay one more second with your crazy ass.\u201d\n\n**And with that, Ludwig was out the door, without packing a single thing.** \n\nI sat stunned for a moment, everything I had believed for days now, turns out it was all a lie. It was just like the last time, but it didn\u2019t have to end that way. \n\n**\u201cHey, Ludwig,\u201d I yelled down the stairs, \u201cYou forgot your fish!\u201d**\n\nI heard his footsteps stop, \u201cGet it straight you crazy bastard, that was never my fish.\u201d\n\n**Then where had Benedict come from, and what was with that name?** \n\nI turned back to the apartment, shrugging. If the fish wasn\u2019t a criminal mastermind, he was welcome to stay here. I looked up just in time to see Ralph, sitting in the doorway, one front paw on the door, Benedict\u2019s fish bowl sitting on the floor in front of him. \n\n*Penelope, between his feet, glared up at me and I swear, if Max, perched on Ralph\u2019s shoulder had fingers, he would have been flipping me off.* \n\nFrom inside the goldfish bowl, I could hear Benedict chuckling softly. \u201cThe day you beat me with a thumb drive, that will be the day. Come on minions, we have hits to carry out,\u201d he said, as Ralph slammed and locked the door. \n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

We must balance many variables when creating cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and economic incentives.  In particular it is important to design systems that remain robust and predictable in *all* market conditions.\n\n## Steem Dollars have Limits \n\nThe idea behind a Steem Dollar is that it should ***almost always*** be worth about one US dollar. We have set rules in place to make this statement true 99% of the time by making the Steem Dollar convertible to a dollar worth of STEEM.  \n\nAnyone who promises you that any asset will **always** be worth something is either ignorant to some risks or a liar.  This is true for bank deposits, gold coins, and crypto currencies.  Banks can seize your funds, go bankrupt, have a bail in, or hyper inflate the currency until it is worthless.  In other words you are never guaranteed purchasing power.\n\nWhen it comes to the Steem Dollar, their purchasing power depends upon the market demand for STEEM.  The Steem Dollar is really nothing more than a smart contract for a variable amount of STEEM depending upon an oracle. If STEEM is worthless than the Steem Dollar will also be worthless.\n\nAs the value of STEEM falls, the amount of STEEM required to represent a U.S. dollar worth of value approaches infinity.  If left unchecked, the Steem Dollar could render STEEM worthless and when that happens all Steem Dollars become worthless too.  \n\n## Black Swan Events need a Plan \n\nIt isn\u2019t possible to prevent all black swan events, but it is possible to establish a fair set of rules for handling them.  It is always best to define the rules before they are necessary so that everyone can take full responsibility for the consequences of their trading decisions.  \n\nThere are two major black swan events that the Steem community and traders should have a contingency plan in place for. The first black swan is if the value of STEEM crashes so far that Steem Dollars represent an insurmountable burden on the STEEM price that sets off a chain reaction pushing the value of STEEM toward zero. \n\nThe second major black swan event is when the US dollar hyperinflates and becomes worthless as a day to day currency.  In my opinion this is the more likely outcome.\n\n## Price Feed defines Value of Steem Dollar\n\nThe price feed can be viewed as a mathematical function that traders and speculators can trade against for determining the value of the Steem Dollar at any time.   Right now we have defined the function to always equal the **approximate marginal price 1 STEEM fetches on the open market**.  \n\nThere are two extreme cases, black swans, that must be considered.  In one extreme the price goes to 0, in the other extreme the price goes to infinity.  It is in the interest of everyone involved that the value of a Steem Dollar never hits either extreme.  This can be implemented in objective terms by setting hard limits on the exchange rate range that is allowed.\n\nWe can set a maximum and minimum Steem Dollar price as follows:\n\n**maximum price** =  SteemSupply / (10 * SteemDollarSupply)\n**minimum price**  =  SteemSupply / (10000 * SteemDollarSupply)\n\nWith these rules in place, Steem Dollar holders are protected against US dollar hyperinflation and Steem holders are protected against US dollar \u201chyperdeflation\u201d.  The witnesses are trusted to publish a honest price feed relative to dollars at all times, but the blockchain will enforce these hard limits.\n\nIn other words, the market cap of all Steem Dollars will always be between 0.01% and 10% of the Steem market cap. This will become a mathematical reality with the addition of two lines of code to the method that calculates the conversion price.  \n\n## Sustainable and Fair\n\nThese rules would make the economic system of Steem sustainable and fair in all circumstances by clarifying the meaning of a Steem Dollar.  With the clarified meaning, a Steem Dollar is allowed to have values above or below a U.S. dollar under certain market conditions.  All traders can be aware of those conditions and trade accordingly.   \n\nBy implementing these rules long before the STEEM / USD price gets near either extreme all market participants have ample opportunity to adjust their positions.  \n\n## No Promise of Value \n\nSteemit, Inc cannot and will not promise that the STEEM token, Steem Power, or Steem Dollars will have any value now or in the future.  We aim only to create fair rules to approximate the relative subjective value each member of the Steem community brings to the table.  Any value these tokens have will at all times be set by the free market through voluntary exchange.  \n\n\n## Benefits over Alternative Approaches\n\nIn a prior post I outlined a solution that would covert 1% of Steem Dollars to Steem Power as a means of correcting the imbalance.  This solution had the nice property of only exposing 1% of a person\u2019s steem dollars to volatility at a time, but had the down side of making the life of exchanges and smart contracts everywhere very complex.   Every smart contract would have to factor in the potential that a liquid asset like Steem Dollars could be partially converted to an illiquid asset such as VESTS.   This great complicates things such as *escrow transactions* and *side chains* and exchange deposits.   In other words, it had all of the negative properties on 3rd parties that could be associated with negative interest rates.\n\nSome people suggested things like bootstrapping an economy around Steem Dollars or buying them back with Ad revenue.  It isn't a matter of finding buyers for Steem Dollars, it is a matter of maintaining a debt ceiling.  Simply moving Steem Dollars from person to person does not solve the problem.  \n\n## Thanks for Feedback \n\nWe would like to thank everyone for the feedback they have provided and invite additional feedback.  We are all in this together, lets make Steem the best platform for everyone involved.",

    "body": "## I'm pretty sure my roommates goldfish is head of a pet syndicate trying to kill him ##\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/8a9513dc5d.jpg)\n\n*I\u2019m not sure when I first noticed it, it might have been when I caught the parakeet watching me in his tiny mirror, following my every move around the room, or when I woke to find Max, my gray tabby cat, watching me sleep from the top  of my chest of drawers at 3 AM.* \n\nBut I finally realized something was wrong when I opened the bathroom door to find Sid, the mastiff, Max the cat, and Penelope, the litter trained Lopeared rabbit, all sitting right outside the bathroom door, seemingly peering under the gap between the door\u2019s bottom and the hallway carpet. They scattered and pretended to be interested in bits of fuzz or beams of light, but I know what I saw, they were watching me. \n\nIt was a Thursday, so I had a late start day, which meant catching up on my Netflix cue and having a leisurely breakfast, then heading to the office around 10. I grabbed the raisin bran and a quart of milk, tucking a large bowl under one arm and clamping the spoon between my teeth, I managed to leave one hand free for a quart-sized tumbler of freshly squeezed OJ, perfect. \n\nI dumped my breakfast on the coffee table and reached into the \u201cremote drawer\u201d in the end table, only to find that the aptly named drawer was not currently home to the control for the Roku. I scanned the room, and there, peering out from behind one chair, was Penlope, eying me suspiciously. I tossed over the chair cushions, discovering a long lost sock, but no remote.\n\n*I quickly scanned the higher surfaces in the room, the mantle, the bookshelf, the entertainment\u2026 and there was the mastiff, peering around the corner from the kitchen. What the heck was going on? Finally, I spotted the remote sitting squarely in front of the goldfish bowl, pointed toward the tv as if Benedict Cumberbatch, the evil eyed gold fish my roommate had arrived with, had been using it. Weird.* \n\nI shrugged it off and sat, hitting my tailbone on Ralph\u2019s denta-chew, which he knew did not belong on the couch, and clicked on the TV and set top Roku streaming box, waiting for it to pick up a wifi signal while I poured cereal and milk. I positioned myself just the right distance from the arm of the sofa to make the reach to the coaster, holding my OJ tumbler, just right and sank back. \n\n**About two clicks into my normal content scrolling routine, I noticed a change.** \n\nI checked the user account, but it was mine, but I knew for a fact I had not watched nearly this quantity of police procedural documentaries. I turned and eyeballed Benedict, who, quickly looked away and pretended to nonchalantly lap his bowl, looking for food flake crumbs. \n\nMust have been the new roommate, or so I convinced myself, and settled in to catch up on Fear of the Walking Dead. It was a successful morning. I\u2019d been able to cram in three episodes, the milk to cereal ratio had been perfect, and the three cubes of  ice in my OJ, were just enough to keep it refreshingly cold, without watering it down. Other than the stronger than usual scent of the almond milk, a nearly perfect breakfast.\n\nI scraped the breakfast fixings up in an armload, grabbing the empty orange juice glass and clicking onto my morning news feed, as I went to the kitchen. \n\n**I froze.** \n\nThere, sitting in a chair at the breakfast table, peering at the screen of my laptop, were Max, Penelope and Ralph, the 200 pound mastiff, all raptly attentive to something. They saw me. \n\nThe cat was the first to move, rubbing his butt past the rabbit as Ralph circled twice and collapsed into a sighing heap on his rug. Penelope, I swear, clicked at least two keys, then pretended to be interested in the wax fruit my mom insisted made a great centerpiece in here. It didn\u2019t. \n\n*I stood a full ten seconds, surveying the scene, before I realized, Ralph had been wearing my reading glasses and was now drooling on them, in an effort to normalize the situation. I peered back around the corner to where Benedict floated, intently still, eyes closed, but definitely a part of all this.* \n\nI was beginning to wonder if I was still dreaming, when I dropped my cereal bowl, a heavy, clay pottery piece, squarely on my  left little toe, bringing tears to my eye, \u201cMother Scratcher,\u201d I said, doing everything I could to juggle the milk and keep it off the floor. Finally, \n\n**I bobbled the milk onto the counter and was able to grab my toes.** \n\n*The tears in my eyes were enough to convince, me, it was real and I swear, that damn cat was laughing.*\n\nAs I was leaving the kitchen, I turned back to find all three mamalians eagerly sniffing at the small puddle of almond milk I\u2019d left, knowing the cat would quickly lap it up. He didn\u2019t. In fact, they all three looked piercingly at me, accusing me of leaving the mess, but none of them darted a curious pink tongue out to even test the air.  \n\n**It was at that moment, the alarm I set to remind me it was time to shower, or face the wrath of the intern supervisor at work, went off and I forgot all about it.** \n\nLater that afternoon, I returned home from work, to find my roommate, Ludwig, ensconced among the animals on the sofa, watching scifi. \u201cLudwig, did you use my Netflix user account?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d He peered up at me, my dog\u2019s head in his lap, glaring up at me, the cat on his shoulder and Penelope eating toasted edamame out of his palm. \u201cOh, hey, you\u2019re home, I mopped up some almond milk, I think, in the kitchen, nearly slipped on it. Surprised the cat hadn\u2019t cleaned it already.\u201d He said, returning full attention to his show. \n\n\u201cCould you turn that down?\u201d I picked up the remote and paused the show. \u201cDude, they are not supposed to be on the so\u2026\u201d Ralph growled at me, in a way that let me know, I needed to get my hand off his backside. \u201cWhat the hell? Ralph, you don\u2019t ever growl at me, what is wrong with you?\u201d Ralph got down from the sofa, picked up the remote and positioned it directly in front of the goldfish bowl. The program resumed. \n\n**Ludwig seemed oblivious to what had just happened, \u201cDid you not see that?\u201d** \n\n\u201cOh, yeah, the dog turned the show back on, I think he was really into it,\u201d Ludwig said. \n\n*I didn\u2019t argue, but I did notice the goldfish smiling smugly as I went to the kitchen to grab a trashbag and the dustbuster. I left them on the coffee table, hoping Ludwig would get the hint and clean up the couch.* \n\nHe smiled, \u201cOh, thanks!\u201d and began to vacuum his shirt with the miniature vacuum. \n\nIt was two o\u2019clock in the morning, when I finally had to admit that either I needed psychiatric help, or my animals were out to get to me. I was awakened by the television. \n\n> \u201c\u2026and here, in the laboratory, the CSI technicians will test the\n> sample for toxicology. Unfortunately, in the majority of these cases,\n> we don\u2019t finish our analysis, the DA gets a plea bargain and the crime  is labeled solved before the evidence is even really examined.\u201d\n\nI rolled over and checked the clock. Okay, Ludwig, time to have it out. I don\u2019t need the money that bad. The rent here hadn\u2019t changed in 30 years, and couldn\u2019t so long as the apartment was continually occupied, and so it had been handed down from roommate, to roommate. \n\n*I stumbled into the living room, rubbing my eyes, as the television went dark. In the glow of the streetlamp, coming in through the windows framing the fireplace mantle, I became aware that Ludwig had either mastered the art of invisibility, or he wasn\u2019t there.* \n\nInstead, Ralph, Max and Penelope sat on the sofa, pretending to sleep, while near the fish\u2019s bowl, I caught the red blink of a light on the remote. This was getting out of hand. \n\n**\u201cListen, Cumberbatch,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m on to you. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re planning yet, but when I find out...\u201d**\n\n\u201cDude! Are you talking to my goldfish?\u201d Ludwig asked, peering out from the hallway. \u201cI thought I heard the TV, could your turn it down, if you need to watch it so late? I have work at 6, sorry to be a jerk about it, but if you could, please?\u201d \n\n*I started to explain, but I was pretty sure I knew where this one was going. There was a long and storied history behind the reasons that Ralph was my first dog since the second grade. It hadn\u2019t ended well for either of us and landed me in therapy, probably for life. I decided to keep the pet\u2019s conspiracy a secret, at least for now.* \n\n\u201cNo, uh, rehearsing lines from a uh,   training video they\u2019re making the intern staff do, sorry, couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d I lied. He squinched his face in a way that let me know, he hadn\u2019t completely bought my lie, then waved me off as he turned and headed back to bed. \n\n**I sat down on the couch, I wasn\u2019t feeling so good.** \n\nRalph shifted over, grudgingly, as I dug behind me for what I thought was Ralph\u2019s chew toy, my hand closed on a hard, glass cylinder. I sat the bottle on the table, it was brown bottle glass, with a black eyedropper top, like the bottle I buy lavender in for head colds, there was no label.\n\nLudwig\u2019s bowl was still on the table from his dinner, I clucked, disgustedly. \n\n*He wasn\u2019t a pig, I had to give him that, he\u2019d likely wake up and clean up the mess before I saw it. But, there it was. I picked up the bottle and unscrewed the lid, a somehow familiar scent escaped, the fumes creating a slightly bitter taste in my mouth, like almonds!* \n\n**Oh, my god, it was cyanide!**\n\nTrembling, I carried the bottle to the kitchen sink, and lowered it in, resting it gently in the bottom of the porcelain basin. What the hell? I turned back to the living room. Ralph was setting up, peering over the sofa at me, and both Max and Penelope sat on the sofa\u2019s back, watching my every move. \n\n*I was afraid to find out, but, I had to know. What the hell was that gold fish making my pets watch?*\n\n\n*Part Two, the Conclusion [can be found here!

    "body": "## It's super easy, they told me, no problem... ##\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/8a3b676988.jpg)\n\nSo, a funny thing happened on my way to the bank with my steem earnings. I read a few Steemit posts, watched a couple of guys do it on video and I thought I was ready. So, I took a few SBD and headed out into the world to figure out how to translated them into spendable cash. \n\n**First, let me say this, if you've never written tutorials, you need some instructions. **\n\nI helped write a huge part of the DIY on Ehow.com, over 3000 tutorials, working with an editor for pay. I am an expert. This does not mean I know everything, but here are a few pro tips, for free:\n\n - Never assume knowledge in your reader, unless it is \"common\" ie: everyone knows what a \"doorknob\" is, but not everyone knows that BTC means bitcoin. \n - Slow down. Think through every step you're taking and explain them. Otherwise, someone (me) could spend 30 minutes finding the currency selector on Poloniex, before they find the SBD exchange. (it's in the bottom right and SBD stands for Steem Backed Dollars)\n - Explain. Don't just tell me to find the \"bitcoin wallet address\" base actionable advice on a specific platform and indicate where to find it. \n\n*Okay, that part of my rant is over,  but seriously Steemers, don't write \"steamers\" make it count. It takes the same amount of energy to do it right. *\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/8a41c6f546.jpg)\n\n## Here are a few of the statements that didn't pan out on my way to cashing out... ##\n\n - Here I am cashing out in 20 minutes!\n - You can do this in one day!\n - Follow these instructions you'll have no problem collecting\n - Why would you want dollars, just spend your Bitcoin!\n - \n**YEAH, RIGHT!**\n\nLet me answer these in order here: \n\n 1. No, you didn't do it the first time in 20 minutes. Takes longer than that to find the platforms and set up the accounts. \n 2. Right. Well, except the part where you have to wait 4-5 days to verify a bank account, which doesn't get mentioned until the comments. \n 3. I did follow the instructions. I'm a carpenter by trade as well, basically a professional at following instructions, I had problems. \n 4. Well, I can't eat bitcoin, because it's virtual, and I can't live off of New Egg and Amazon gift certs. My local Walmart doesn't take bitcoin, and I thought this was a liberty thing, mind your own!\n\n*Now, let me say, I knew this was going to be a learning experience, so it wasn't all bad, but it was pretty frustrating. If Bitcoin fans really want crypto to become universal, they have a lot of idiot proofing to do. *\n\n**I am  not a technician, but I have earned my living almost exclusively online since 09, so I'm not a newb, either. Here is what I see.** \n\n - The fact that the crypto space has been almost entirely the domain of coders (rightly so) means there is a huge, and somewhat arrogant assumption of knowledge on the part of writers. \n - I would suggest going into this with a few SBD to start. That way, if you get in the wrong platform and find out it costs you an arm and a leg, the damage is minimal. \n - The fact that every single platform is (at best) in beta, means guys like me haven't gotten into the FAQ and edited out the tech jargon and made it understandable. It's gonna take a while. \n\n*As part of #dolphinschool I would love to see some videos made of this process that really go into enough detail to get a complete beginner thought it without too much frustration. *\n\n**So, I signed up for several platforms and settled on Poloniex for my very first trade. **\n\nFor as complex as it is,the Poloniex platform is fairl straight forward. unless you are working off of incomplete instructions. \n\n - I got signed up, found the address and memo just fine, so I got my SBD loaded without difficulty. \n - The wait for saleable assets was a bit longer than advertised, it took about 45 minutes for the transfer from steemit to Poloniex to be complete. \n - It took me about 30 minutes to find the SBD exchange. This was due to incomplete instructions in a steemer's video, but I found it. \n\nChecking the market and making the sale, surprisingly, was not difficult. Then, I had to figure out what to do with the BTC I had purchased. \n\n**I finally settled on coinbase as a base of operations, on the recommendation of a good friend. **\n\nMoving the money between Poloniex and Coinbase was simple, once I found the wallet address. \n \n## Then I hit my first big roadblock ##\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/8a538548fa.jpg)\n\nIt seems that Gobank, which I use in conjunction with Paypal for nearly all of my banking needs, is considered a \"prepaid account\".\n\n**Aren't all checking accounts \"prepaid\" WTH does that even mean, of course, you prepay money in, then you can spend it**\n \n\n - Gobank was good  enough for the IRS to deposit to\n - Gobank works for wire transfers. \n - I've even cashed Canadian paychecks from the US using it. \n\n**But it's not good enough for Coinbase, I guess. Fine.**\n\nSo, I opted for setting up a debit card, and here is where I hit another obstacle. My ID would not scan properly. I wonder if this is because of my two addresses. \n\n - I can't use my home address as mail, because a mailman once attacked my dog and rightly got bit. \n - So, I have a \"Private Mail Box\" where I receive court and tax documents, bank cards, etc. \n - My ID has my home address, obviously. \n\nSo, although Crypto claims anonymity, my identity was a problem. Finally it accepted an email confirmation it requested and after about three rounds of SMS codes, I was in and had my BTC wallet balance. \n\n## Next up I needed a way to spend it ##\n\nBut, as it turns out, the BTC debit card world isn't too fond of the US, or we aren't fond of them. Most wouldn't issue in the US, although they have cards that spend USD. Suck!\n\n - I could get Bit Plastic, but the deposit is more than I have earned in BTC so far. (over $100)\n - Several outright refused due to my US address, something we Americans are not use to at all! LOL\n - Finally I decided on the Shift Card and set it up. \n\n**Everything went well, until they took my money, then they sent a message saying there was an error, they would contact me**\n\nBy this point, it was about 1 am, so I went to bed and set out to contact support this morning. \n\n - Shifts support wanted me to \"add my email accounts\" and asked me to enter my screen name and password, without taking me too the Google portal. \n - This sounded \"phishy\" so I  backed out and found a direct email for suport. \n - KUDOS to Shift for answering promptly. I had a refund in less than two hours (not what I wanted, I wanted the damn card to be on its way)\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/8a4970f1d6.jpg)\n\n**Turns out, you must have a residential mailing address, confirmed with your name. No, my PMB, good enough for the IRS, banks and the state is not good enough, no I cannot use someone else's address to have it mailed to!**\n\nWhich brings me to the point of my post. It is not as easy as many made it look. The setup takes time and patience. Now I am asking for suggestions on other options. I'm not looking to open a standard checking account, that always costs in fees,  always.\n\n**There was one other method, using a \"local\" bitcoin buyer and meeting up with some stranger in a parking lot to exchange cash for the release of bitcoin. Um, no thanks. **\n\nSO, if anyone has a method that is reasonably simple and easy to engage in on a regular basis, please leave the details in my comments. Thanks. \n\nSo, #dolphinschool readers, sorry for the rant, but be prepared, it may take some work on your part to trade your earnings for cash. Good luck!\n\n## Look for the upvote button below.

    "body": "<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Black_Swan_bg.jpg/2880px-Black_Swan_bg.jpg\nBlack swan on Vacha reservoir, Bulgaria  by [Kiril Krastev](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Littlegrizmin)</center>\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, our team has been working through the Steem Dollar mechanics in an effort to secure the economic foundation of Steem against black swan events.  It should be obvious to all that if at any point in the future the market cap of Steem fell below the supply of Steem Dollars then the Steem Dollar would break.   Long before that happened there would be a *run on the bank*.  \n\nWe designed the Steem incentives to always push Steem toward a Steem Dollar supply equal to about 5% of the available market cap.  This happens because for every Steem Dollar we create we create about 19 Steem Dollar\u2019s worth of Steem and Steem Power.  \n\nThis system works well when the market cap is rising or relatively stable, but there is one edge case which could cause the system to unravel.  When the market cap falls and pushes the Steem Dollar ratio to dangerously high levels (20% or more of market cap), then the network must start paying off its \u201cdebt\u201d with \u201cequity\u201d and reducing the Steem Dollar supply.  \n\n## Extremely Unlikely but not Impossible\n\nBefore anyone starts worrying, lets look at what would have to happen before these kind of scenarios become a concern.   \n\nCurrently **Steem Dollars represent about 1% of market cap** and total about $2.1 million dollars.  This is a very safe level.   The market cap would have to fall to $10.5 million dollars before Steem Dollars represents 20% or more of the market cap.    \n\nEach day the supply of Steem Dollars is increasing so over time the danger zone market cap will rise.  \n\n## Reducing Steem Dollar Supply in Down Market\n\nThere is only one way to reduce the Steem Dollar supply and that is by users voluntarily converting their Steem Dollars to STEEM at the price feed via the 7 day conversion. This processes can be incentivized by offering a short-term premium conversion rate that gives each Steem Dollar holder $1.25 worth of STEEM when they convert.   This is possible by having the witnesses temporarily adjust the price feed. \n\nIt would be critical that the premium remain temporary and has a pre-planned deadline or else the market would permanently adjust the trading value of Steem Dollars to reflect this new premium conversion rate.  \n\nSteem Whales can also buy Steem Dollars on the market by powering down some STEEM and then convert to back to STEEM.  This process would not necessarily be profitable for whales and suffers tragedy of the commons.  One whale would carry the burden for the benefit of the entire platform.\n\n## Stop Increasing the Supply\n\nOf course it gets difficult to reduce the Steem Dollar supply when the supply keeps growing due to interest and author rewards.  The fastest way to dig yourself out of a hole is to stop digging.  As it exists today, this isn\u2019t an option for author rewards but it is possible to reduce the interest rate to 0%. \n\n## New Enhancements for Stability \n\nIn the up coming hard fork we will be including changes to the protocol designed to protect all parties in the event persistent price declines and lack of redemption requests allow the Steem Dollar supply to reach unhealthy and unsustainable levels. \n\n### Gradual Shift in Author Rewards \n\nAs the Steem Dollar supply grows from 3% to 5% the percent of author rewards paid in Steem Dollars will go from 50% to 0% and the percent paid as liquid STEEM will go from 0% to 50%.  In this way authors are still awarded with liquid assets, but the network gradually slows down the printing presses on Steem Dollars. \n\nAt current levels, this measure wouldn\u2019t take effect unless the market cap fell to $70M and would completely stop issuing new Steem Dollars when the market cap fell to about $40M.  \n\n### Gradual Forced Redemption of Steem Dollars for STEEM\n\nAny time the Steem Dollar supply reaches 20% of the market cap, 1% of everyone\u2019s Steem Dollars will be converted to Steem Power at the price feed.  This action can be viewed as a partial \u201cbail-in\u201d where everyone is treated equally.  This will immediately reduce the Steem Dollar percent of total market cap while preventing immediate dumping of the STEEM which could accelerate the collapse in a positive feedback loop.\n\nSteem Dollar holders that wish to avoid this forced redemption should convert to STEEM and sell on the market.  If done via the 7 day conversion process, then the supply should decrease naturally and all Steem Dollar holders can be spared the \u201cbail in\u201d.  \n\n## Implications \n\nIt is our belief that having this safety net in place before it becomes an issue will help the entire community know how stake will be allocated in the event of persistent long term declines in price.  The existence of this safety net will in turn reduce the likelihood that fear will turn into panic selling that would ultimately precipitate such an event.\n\nIt should be obvious to all that Steem Dollars are not backed by any individual holding dollars in a bank or promising to pay US dollars and that the only thing you are guaranteed is some amount of STEEM.  The STEEM cannot be guaranteed to have purchasing power.  \n\nUnder the enhanced rules everyone is protected and fairly dealt with in the unfortunate event that the market cap of the platform is unable to sustain the Steem Dollar debt levels.\n\n## Feedback Wanted\nIf anyone has any concerns or has better solutions in mind please let us know.",

    "body": "I reviewed code changes for hardfork 13 and assisted the core devs in finding issues and iterating on the design of the new mining algorithm included in v0.13.0.\n\nI provided a suggestion for how to [fix the unvoting bug](https://github.com/steemit/steem/issues/259#issuecomment-239598465). Thanks goes to @abit for taking my suggested fix and actually making the [pull request](https://github.com/steemit/steem/pull/270) for the patched code, which has now been merged to develop.\n\nI found a [problem with the new hot algorithm](https://github.com/steemit/steem/issues/297) and recommended a solution to fix it. My recommend fix has now been [implemented in the develop branch](https://github.com/steemit/steem/commit/69d41a233971b19f60d09a1c0a32432e5b83c146).\n\nI have also been working on some ideas related to curation. Particularly, I've been thinking about a design to allow those with excess voting power to sell their rshares in a market. Then curators would have the option to buy the best offers of rshares in the market using their own SD up to a specified price or amount at the same time that they vote on a post/comment in order to boost their voting influence beyond what their current SP and voting power gives them normally. This allows curators who strongly believe they have found a highly undervalued post to get a larger share of the curation rewards than they could with their SP alone by paying some SD out of their pocket. The price they pay is determined by the market: how badly excess rshares is in demand by curators versus how desperate SP holders are to sell off their excess rshares that they aren't putting to good use so that they can make some extra money. Because the excess rshares will disappear in a relatively short time period if it isn't put to use (either used by the SP holder to vote, or sold in this rshares/SD market), the market price for the excess rshares could potentially be quite affordable for curators since it is better for an SP holder to at least get something (even if it is not much) rather than nothing.\n\nAfter some discussion with @complexring, I am also beginning to think through the design of a curation delegation feature. The rshares market discussed in the previous paragraph is good for curators who have some extra liquid capital that they are willing to spend to get a temporary boost in their voting influence and correspondingly larger curation rewards (but they don't want to spend their liquid capital to buy more SP, which while it would give the curator a boost in voting influence, it would be a longer-term boost at the cost of requiring significantly larger amounts of their liquid capital to be spent to buy the SP, which may not be worth it for the curator). However, there is also demand by some curators who want to have more voting influence and correspondingly get larger curation rewards but would rather pay for it not through their capital but with their time. In other words, if someone is willing to supply the capital (really the rshares made possible from the large SP holdings) then those curators will spend their time finding good posts and voting on the capital supplier's behalf with only the request that the curator gets some agreed upon cut of the curation rewards they generate. This is where a curation delegation feature could come in handy. An auction market is not good for this type of arrangement because this arrangement requires the capital provider to trust the curators they hire to some degree (and to oversee their curation to make sure they are doing a decent job) since the capital providers payment is contingent upon the curators they contract with doing a good job in curation. Instead the curation delegation feature should allow the capital provider to specify some limited number of curators (assuming the curators also agree) that are allowed to tap into capital provider's voting power, and for each curator, the capital provider would specify percentage of the curation rewards earned that goes to them as well as the rate limit on how quickly the curator can consume the voting power. \n\nFor now, I will only be working on both the rshares market and the curation delegate feature at the conceptual design stage and not spend too much of my time on it, unless Steemit core devs express a desire to actually see any of these features included into Steem.",

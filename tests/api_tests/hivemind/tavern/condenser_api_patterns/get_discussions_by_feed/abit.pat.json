The Three Strikes Act funnels the unemployed masses into a national network of work camps for the most trivial of infractions.\n\nLando Cruz is a scrappy rebel who risks his final strike on the streets of Philadelphia by trading illegal currencies under cover of a burrito stand. He spends his days bribing dirty cops, fending off undercover federal agents and shepherding his little sister through adolescence.\n\nLando is getting by until beat cops seize his savings and kidnap his sister for ransom. He has thirty days to raise the hard cash he needs to free her before she is sold into sex slavery. His only chance is a lucrative job offer from the black market rebellion's paramilitary startup, the Core. He risks both his life and his principles to get his sister back before time runs out.\n\n## Episode 60: Puff Bang\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to make contact with the hackers,\u201d said Jerry. \u201cAnd you guys \u2026 ?\u201d The group sat in the office module now.\n\n\u201cAlexis, Ryan and I will scope out the camp,\u201d said Lando. \u201cWe\u2019ll watch the shifts change, take photos \u2014 a regular stakeout!\u201d He grinned.\n\n\u201cMy uncle is in there,\u201d said Jerry. \u201cMaybe he can make a little something happen on the inside while we hit it from the outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Eastern State?\u201d asked Lando. He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea to look at when we get closer,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s you and Takoda. David, I want you to contact the Free Aid people and see if they can design a transition process for these people. You know, help them start agorist businesses, find \u2014\u201d\n\nDavid tightened his face. \u201cI don\u2019t like this plan and I don\u2019t want to work on it.\u201d He stood up.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll hand malt liquor to a maniac with a gun, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Jerry. He stood up. His chair hit the ground behind him.\n\nDavid\u2019s face got red. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust get out,\u201d said Lando to David. He pointed towards the living area. \u201cGo watch some TV or something.\u201d\n\nTakoda snickered.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll contact Free Aid when we get back,\u201d said Lando. \u201cLet\u2019s hit the street, guys.\u201d He turned to Ryan. \u201cWould you mind leading the way out?\u201d\n\nRyan led them out of the office and into the cellar. It smelled of mildew. Alexis brushed cobwebs out of her hair. Ryan turned on a small screen. The alley above appeared on it. Three different perspectives cycled.\n\n\u201cYou really have all your bases covered,\u201d said Lando to Ryan.\n\nRyan brushed past him and opened the cellar doors. \u201cUp and out, folks. Move it. Make it quick.\u201d Harold closed the doors behind them and stayed below.\n\nLando rubbed his palms on the sides of his pants. \u201cGood luck, guys.\u201d His face darkened.\n\nJerry and Takoda shook hands with Lando. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be cool, man,\u201d said Jerry.\n\nLando rubbed his head with both hands. \u201cBe safe, guys. Whatever you do, be safe.\u201d\n\nTakoda grinned and waved an arm at Lando. \u201cWhoever gets back last buys dinner!\u201d\n\nLando watched them walk down the alley. He turned and looked at Ryan and Alexis. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d They rounded the corner onto the main street. Lando turned around to face Ryan. \u201cDo we have access to transportation?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, do you need a car? You never said anything to me about it,\u201d said Ryan.\n\nLando narrowed his eyes. \u201cReally? And you tell me I have a bad attitude?\u201d\n\nRyan continued on past him down the street. Lando shoved his hands into his pockets and studied the broken lines of the sidewalk. They walked in silence for four blocks.\n\nAlexis stepped in front of him. \u201cThis is all wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to call it off.\u201d She held his hands between hers.\n\nLando shook his head. \u201cMaybe you should go back?\u201d He caught up to Ryan. \u201cDo we at least have a budget?\u201d\n\nA puff of smoke appeared on the ground in front of Lando, then a flash of light. He brought his arm in front of his face and a bang deafened him. Ryan hit the ground a few feet forward.\n\nLando turned to look for a cause but his body got hot. *What the hell is going \u2014* He screamed. The heat overpowered him. He lost consciousness and hit the cement.\n\n## Episode 61: Strike Three\n\nA rough hand jerked his shoulder. Lando sat up and took a deep breath. He looked around through half-open eyes. Lando sat on a thin steel slab that shot out of the wall at a right angle.\n\nHis torso shivered. His hands froze into fists. His feet sucked the iciness from the concrete floor into his bones. He stood up. A deep ache ripped into his thigh and he crashed down again.\n\nRyan paced the breadth of the tiny concrete cage. He stopped. \u201cThey shot you with a rubber bullet and knocked you out with the phaser. You actually withstood it longer than most. But just be still.\u201d\n\nLando arched his neck back. He modulated his breathing, in and out, to counteract the pain. His skin was dry and tight. And everything was swollen. Outside the rusty bars, there was only more gray concrete at the ceiling, floor and wall. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cPhilly Police, third district,\u201d Ryan said. He started to pace again. One step and a half, then he turned and repeated the rhythm.\n\nLando rubbed his head. \u201cAlexis?\u201d\n\nA shadow darkened the cell. \u201cWell, hello there little buddy. How nice to see you again.\u201d It was Sarge.\n\nLando massaged his head with both hands. He groaned.\n\n\u201cYou know this guy?\u201d Ryan turned to Lando. He looked at the floor.\n\n\u201cThis asshole ripped off my bitcoin and put my family in a cage.\u201d\n\nRyan leaned against a wall and looked down.\n\n\u201cHow are they doing, kid? Maybe I should go check on that sweet little sister of yours,\u201d said Sarge.\n\nLando looked up at him and narrowed his eyes. \n\n\u201cThey got terrorism charges on you, kid. Strike three. Looks like we\u2019ll be spending more time together, eh?\u201d Sarge sneered. \n\nRyan inspected his fingernails.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see now,\u201d said Sarge. He pulled out a tablet and tapped it. \u201cYes. Strike one was attempting to enter school without legal papers. But that was before we started counting strikes. And there\u2019s something here about shoplifting. Tsk tsk.\u201d He shook his head.\n\nLando turned his face away from Sarge and bumped his thigh against the steel shelf. A buzz of pain hit him and he winced.\n\n\u201cLike that?\u201d Sarge jammed his thumb into his chest. \u201cMy handiwork. Takes a lot of range time to land a shot like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Lando yelled.\n\nSarge laughed. He looked down at the tablet again. \u201cSo the real strike one was possession and transport of pirated pharmaceuticals. And when that didn\u2019t work out, sale of pirated movies for your second strike.\u201d He looked up from the tablet. \u201cYou still got a connection there? I\u2019m looking for that latest one from \u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get to it,\u201d said Ryan.\n\nSarge raised his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re done, Sergeant, then we need our prisoner,\u201d said a voice in the corridor.\n\nSarge looked to his right and grimaced. He snapped his fingers above his head. The cell door screeched open. He pointed to Ryan.\n\nRyan turned and looked down at Lando. He got a faraway look in his eye, then turned again and walked out of the cell.\n\n\u201cMove it,\u201d said a voice. The cell door crawled towards the wall. A mechanism clanged and sealed it shut.\n\nLando\u2019s upper body muscles pulled taut. He closed his eyes and his teeth ground together. *Just don\u2019t react. Just don\u2019t feel. Just be. It \u2014*\n\n\u201cWake up, Cruz!\u201d yelled Sarge. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be in here a while and I don\u2019t want you to miss a single second of the fun.\u201d \n\n## Episode 62: Lawless\n\nRyan sauntered back into the cage and it closed behind him. He shook his head. \u201cThese little \u2026\u201d He looked up at Lando. \u201cHow\u2019re you holding up?\u201d He stretched his neck from side to side.\n\nLando exhaled. \u201cWell, a little better now that you\u2019re back, to be honest.\u201d\n\nRyan smiled. \u201cWorried?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d Lando asked. \u201cDid they offer you any kind of a deal?\u201d\n\nRyan shrugged.\n\nLando sighed. \u201cYou know, you never told me how you became an agorist.\u201d\n\nRyan bared his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s these people who steal. They just piss me off. You work so hard for something and they steal it from you.\u201d\n\nLando cocked an eyebrow. \u201cI hear \u2014\u201c\n\nRyan made two fists and punched the air. \u201cIt drives me mad! You work so hard for something. You sacrifice. You invent something new, you build something where there was nothing, and then they just take it from you without a second thought. And they claim it as their own.\u201d He turned his face towards the corridor and yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s the sheer audacity!\u201d \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Lando. \u201cWas  there a particular writer or \u2014\u201c\n\nThe cage door swung open and a man in plainclothes motioned to Lando. \u201cLet\u2019s go, son. We\u2019re going to have a little chat.\u201d\n\nLando limped down the corridor and entered a room with a table and chairs. He took a seat across from another man in plainclothes.\n\n\u201cCoffee?\u201d asked the second man.\n\nLando studied each one\u2019s face in turn.\n\n\u201cGive it to him hot with plenty of sugar. He needs it after being in that cell. Did you know, kid, that it\u2019s the coldest one in the place? It\u2019s right next to the system. I\u2019m Reilly, by the way, and my associate here is Lawless. We\u2019re detectives.\u201d \n\nLando grinned despite himself.\n\nReilly turned to Lawless. \u201cIt\u2019s your last name. He thinks it\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\nLawless shrugged.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re an agorist,\u201d said Reilly.\n\nLando opened his mouth and the memory came back to him. *Never talk to cops.* He cocked an eyebrow and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s usually a smart move,\u201d said Reilly, \u201cto not talk to me. Except, in this case, you\u2019re fucked ten ways to Sunday with these terrorism charges.\u201d He sat back and interlaced his fingers behind his head.\n\nLawless spoke up. \u201cI heard these IPEC guys are hot for him. Something about running an agorist bank outside the Fed?\u201d\n\nLando struggled to suppress another grin. He ran his hands through his hair and slouched in the metal chair. He cleared his throat and sat up straight. \u201cWhat about Alexis?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has good taste, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Reilly asked Lawless.\n\nLawless nodded in approval.\n\nLando narrowed his eyes at them. \u201cIs she okay? Or did you guys hurt her, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had nothing to do with the fireworks display, kid. That was the boys in black,\u201d said Reilly.\n\n\u201cThose guys ripped me off. They stole my bitcoin \u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d said Reilly. He looked at Lando over a pair of reading glasses and wagged an index finger at him. \u201cCan\u2019t do anything about it. Don\u2019t give a shit, either.\u201d\n\nLando flared his nostrils and slouched into the metal chair.\n\n\u201cNow, tell us about this flag \u2014\u201c started Reilly.\n\n\u201cHow about some fucking medical treatment?\u201d roared Lando. \u201cYour dogs shot me when I wasn\u2019t even conscious!\u201d He crossed his arms and tightened his face.\n\n\u201cHe wants to take a hard line,\u201d said Lawless to Reilly. \u201cHe\u2019s a street agorist. Gotta have a good story when he gets out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a terrorist!\u201d said Reilly. He slammed his hand down on the metal table and stood up. \u201cHe\u2019s not getting out! Listen, kid,\u201d he said to Lando. \u201cI\u2019m the only thing standing between you and the feds. Have you thought about what IPEC is going to do to you?\u201d\n\n## Episode 63: Snitch\n\n\u201cI tell all for fifteen to twenty,\u201d said Lando. \u201cRat you and everyone else out.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of?\u201d asked Ryan.\n\n\u201cLife, of course.\u201d Lando scowled at him. \u201cYou know how Three Strikes works. Three strikes and you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nRyan raised an eyebrow. He sat next to Lando on the steel shelf in the cell. \u201cRight. I just hadn\u2019t thought of it like that before.\u201d\n\nLando bent over and looked Ryan in the eye. \u201cYou created \u2026 you know what \u2026 and you don\u2019t think about sitting in a cage for the rest of your life? Are you kidding me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you do? You think about that?\u201d asked Ryan.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m not worrying about my sister getting kidnapped, my dad dying or where the rent is coming from, uh, yeah!\u201d Lando rolled his eyes.\n\nRyan stood up and paced again. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with your dad?\u201d\n\n\u201cCancer,\u201d said Lando.\n\nRyan raised his eyebrows. \u201cThey have medication for that now. Just go to \u2014\u201c\n\nLando narrowed his eyes at him. \u201cNot for illegals.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought \u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lando. \u201cIt\u2019s propaganda. They give us a Tylenol and a week later Homeland Security shows up at the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe black market, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean the agora? Expensive,\u201d said Lando. \u201cI\u2019ve kept it at bay with high-CBD cannabis but he\u2019s not getting that on the inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do? Did they say anything about your family?\u201d\n\nLando waved a hand over his shoulder. \u201cThey won\u2019t do a damned thing for them. And we\u2019ll win this thing before fifteen years are up. But I\u2019ll be stuck in here the whole time, missing all the action and the fun.\u201d Lando curled himself into the fetal position on the icy metal shelf.\n\n## What Next?\n\nAfter I finish this series, what kind of story do you want to read next?

We were awoken to the sound of a loud scream outside. At once, I recognised that voice, shot out of bed and ran down the stairs to see what happened. Mini was standing in the kitchen with half her face covered in blood. Horrified, I quickly went up to her and saw long scratched marks on her underside which was bleeding profusely. She must have been licking the wound which was when she managed to get the blood on her face. We rang the vet emergency services and carefully took her to be seen.

According to <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201401/reading-fiction-improves-brain-connectivity-and-function\">Psychology Today</a>, 42% of college-educated Americans will never read another book for the rest of their lives after graduation.</h1>\n<p>If it's hard for you to wrap your mind around this, you're not alone. It horrifies me on so many levels.</p>\n<p>I can't even imagine life without books.</p>\n<p>There's nothing quite like the smell of a bookstore. Whenever I walk into a Barnes and Noble, I take a deep breath and smile. Libraries, too. It's that strange and wonderful mishmash of people, paper, binding and glue. There is so much potential in that smell.</p>\n<p>Books have so much to offer us, if we only would reach out and take it.</p>\n<h1>The Benefits: Fiction versus Non-fiction and the Research:</h1>\n<p>I personally love to read both fiction and non-fiction, often at the same time, and for different reasons.</p>\n<p>I primarily read fiction for entertainment and escape.</p>\n<p>For the last 6 years, I've lived with a chronic illness called Meniere's disease. It's not fatal, but there's also no cure, and it can make my life difficult at times.</p>\n<p>A good book takes me away from it all. One day I get to immerse myself in a beautiful alien world, and the next, I am seeing through the eyes of a missionary in the Amazon. No movie can hold a candle to the power of the imagination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/b1b6162b14.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"541\"/></p>\n<p>I read non-fiction to learn and grow. A great non-fiction book can download a lifetime of ideas and experience directly into your brain. Think about it: someone took the time to collect ideas, research, and explore, and distill the concepts down into a form that you can absorb. It\u2019s such a powerful tool.</p>\n<p>And there are other less tangible benefits of reading, too. The mental and intellectually stimulating nature of reading has been shown to help <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/08/05/health-benefits-reading_n_4081258.html\">keep your mind sharp</a> and possibly even <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2001-03-05-alzheimers-hobbies.htm\">prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</a></p>\n<p>Research has also discovered that reading fiction, and narrative non-fiction, can improve brain connectivity and improve empathy as well. In a <a href=\"http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/brain.2013.0166\">2013 study at Emory University</a>, researchers found that reading creates a lasting increase in brain connectivity. In an <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/01/study-reading-a-novel-changes-your-brain/282952/\">interview with The Atlantic</a>, Gregory Berns, the lead author of the study explains:&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><strong>\u201cThe neural changes that we found associated with physical sensation and movement systems suggest that reading a novel can transport you into the body of the protagonist...We already knew that good stories can put you in someone else\u2019s shoes in a figurative sense. Now we\u2019re seeing that something may also be happening biologically.\u201d</strong></blockquote>\n<h1>How to Develop a Consistent Reading Habit:</h1>\n<p>If you want to start reading more, and reading more consistently, here are several effective strategies that I\u2019ve discovered over the years to create a strong reading habit that sticks:</p>\n<h2>1)Listen to an audio book instead:</h2>\n<p>Not everyone enjoys reading, but that's okay! You can listen to audiobooks instead. And it's not \"cheating.\" In an <a href=\"http://www.danielwillingham.com/daniel-willingham-science-and-education-blog/is-listening-to-an-audio-book-cheating\">article by University of Virginia psychologist Daniel Willingham</a>, he explains that our brains perceive regular books and audiobooks in more or less the same way:</p>\n<blockquote><strong>\"For most books, for most purposes, listening and reading are more or less the same thing.\"&nbsp;</strong></blockquote>\n<p>If you want to give audiobooks a try, you can borrow audio books from the library with <a href=\"http://www.overdrive.com\">Overdrive.</a> Or you can use <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00NB86OYE/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1422899139880&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=pf4&amp;tag=minovemens-20&amp;linkId=RUABUIO754T5QIZJ\">Audible by Amazon</a>, which allows you to stream and download audio books on demand.</p>\n<h2>2) Use Goodreads to keep track of your reading:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com\">Goodreads</a> is a social network for readers. It offers excellent book recommendations based on what you have already read and what you are interested in, and allows you to see what your friends are reading. But best of all, Goodreads makes it incredibly simple to keep track of the books you've read as well as the books you want to read.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the reading challenge feature allows you to set a reading goal for the year and helps to keep you on track to hit your goal.</p>\n<h2>3) Try to read at the same time every day:</h2>\n<p>If you want to read consistently, you have to try to incorporate reading into your daily routine. But don\u2019t try to read for hours and hours, every day, right off the bat. Aim for consistency. Start at the same time and read for a little while every day.</p>\n<h2>4) Take notes and highlight as you read:</h2>\n<p>When you read nonfiction, you can get a lot more out of the book if you take notes and make highlights as you read. Once you finish the book, review your notes, and transcribe them somewhere that you can review back easily. I use Evernote for this purpose, and if you read ebooks, this process is incredibly simple.</p>\n<p>For example, with the Amazon Kindle app all your notes and highlights can be backed up easily. Once you've finished your book, simply log on to the <a href=\"http://kindle.amazon.com\">Amazon Kindle App Website </a>and click \"Your Highlights\" at the top. You can then pull up all your notes and highlights for all of your books and easily copy and paste them into long term storage.</p>\n<h2>5) Use idea lists to help remember what you've learned</h2>\n<p>I picked up this trick from the best-selling author of \"<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2bwMwdZ\">Choose Yourself</a>\", James Altucher. After you read a book, create a list of 10 things (from memory) that you learned from the book. It will help you remember what you read so you can start applying it to your life.</p>\n<h1>Books, Books, and More Books \u2013 Resources for Reading!</h1>\n<p>To help get you started on your new reading habit, here are few resources and several of my favorite books for you to explore:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/ku/sign-up/ref=sv_kstore_1\"><strong>Kindle Unlimited</strong></a>: For $10 a month you can read an unlimited number of Amazon Kindle Books!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/\"><strong>Scientific Speed Reading</strong></a>: People have mixed opinions on speed reading, and your symptoms may make this difficult, but last year I discovered this incredible technique by Author Tim Ferriss and was able to nearly double my reading speed. It felt like I had discovered a hidden super power and it only took about 20 minutes to learn.</p>\n<h2><strong>A few of my favorite books:</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1JK71Nd\"><strong>Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris</strong></a>: A hilarious collection of short stories and essays by New York Times best-selling author David Sedaris. Possibly the funniest book I have ever read.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1igWXkn\"><strong>Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson</strong></a>: The incredible and mind bending story of 3 deep sea divers who discover a sunken German U-Boat 50 miles off the coast of New Jersey that\u2019s not supposed to exist.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1JK777o\"><strong>The Martian by Andy Weir</strong></a>: One of the best Sci-Fi books I\u2019ve read all year. This book tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney who gets stranded on Mars during a sand storm. A movie based on this book is coming out soon with Matt Daemon as the lead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1JK763t\"><strong>At Play in the Fields of the Lord by Peter Matthiessen</strong></a>: I don\u2019t read a lot of literary fiction but this was one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. It follows 2 characters, one a mercenary, and the other a Christian missionary, as they interact with undiscovered tribes in the Amazon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1igX2Ve\"><strong>Man\u2019s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl</strong></a>: Viktor Frankl was a psychiatrist who survived the Nazi concentration camps and went on to detail his experience and ideas on the meaning of life. A powerful and inspirational book like no other</p>\n</html>",

Learn what type of Sales Dog You are. \n\nOne of the biggest struggles as an entrepreneur is to teach your team to sell. Today it seems the great majority of the population is afraid of sales. I believe sales is the foundation of every successful business. Without sales you might as well close shop.\n\nEach sales dog has traits that help them be successful. Personally I am a Basset Hound and Golden Retriever mix. It is normal to be a mix but we will always have one dominant sales dog type.\n\n## Why I Made the Sales Dog Presentation. ##\n\nI made this presentation for [The Founders Institute Panama](http://fi.co/mentors). We help incubate startup companies. Ira Miller (Co-Founder of Coinapult) is the brains behind the initiative. \n\nThe Crypto world is represented strongly in The Founders Institute Panama. Some of the mentors include Daniel Diaz of Dash, Gabriel Sukenik of Coinapult, Ashe Whitener of Liberty Entrepreneurs, Gabriel Abad of Bitt, Cindy Zimmerman of Tigo CTM and of course myself. \n\n## Personal Sales Dog Story. ##\n\nA few years ago my wife [Anabell Hilarski](http://anabellhilarski.com) and I were talking about sales. I was asking her to help me sell our services. She said, \"I can't sell\". I said, \"really, how did you get me then?\" The truth is we are all natural born sales people. As we grow up that ability is diminished because society makes us feel dirty if we try to sell something.\n\nHave you ever convinced friends to go to a specific movie or restaurant? Guess what, that was sales my friend. If you want to be truly successful in life you have to learn how to sell. Rejection comes with the territory but if you can overcome the negative association with sales you can transform your life, relationships and business.\n\n## The Types of Sales Dogs. ##\n\n<center>http://www.randyhilarski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sales-Dogs-1.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://www.randyhilarski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sales-Dogs-2.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://www.randyhilarski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sales-Dogs-3.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://www.randyhilarski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sales-Dogs-4.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://www.randyhilarski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sales-Dogs-5.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://www.randyhilarski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sales-Dogs-6.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://www.randyhilarski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sales-Dogs-7.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://www.randyhilarski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sales-Dogs-8.jpg</center>\n\nTo Download the presentation go to Slideshare, \"[The 5 Types of Sales People and Their Dog Equivalent.](http://www.slideshare.net/RandyHilarski/the-5-types-of-sales-people-and-their-dog-equivalent)\"\n\n## Very Few People Can Resist a Well Rounded Sales Dog. ## \n\n<center>https://media.giphy.com/media/bYa7aGxm2lxmM/giphy.gif</center>",

    "body": "https://i.imgsafe.org/b166019625.jpg\n\nOver any one thing that completely shatters my heart in this world, it is always bullying hands down which I put at number 1. Knowing that good children end their lives because of their peers and how their peers single them out as targets kills me. Every time I see a story like this I almost lose complete Faith in humanity. I consider myself somewhat of a badass yet I fucking lose it when I find out a child has taken their life due to bullying. \n\nLast week, Daniel Fitzpatrick, 13, took his own life after being taunted and bullied over his \"weight, grades and his innocent heart.\" His dad blamed Holy Angels Catholic Academy, accusing the school of turning a blind eye and refusing to help his son.\n\nTo further his point, Daniel's father decided to release the heart wrenching note his son wrote before taking his life. \"I wanted to get out, I begged and I pleaded. Eventually I did, I failed but I didn't care. I was out that's all I wanted,\" the 13-year-old wrote.\n\nThe entire letter read:\n\n\"At first it was good. Lots of friends, good grades and a great life, but I moved and went back and it was different,\" Daniel wrote.\n\n\"My old friends changed, they didn't talk to me, they didn't even like me.\"\n\n\"My 'friend,' he failed me and I failed too. But A took it out on me. He bullied me along with J, M, JO, and JA. They did it constantly until I went into a fight with A. Everyone stopped except JO, he was angry.\n\n\"I ended up getting x-rays for my pinkie from JO. I ended up fighting Jo and got a fractured pinkie. He got into a lot of trouble as for me, no trouble at all.\"\n\n\"But they continued, I gave up, the teachers either they didn't do anything! Not get them in trouble even though they did trouble, I got in trouble instead because A was mad at me because he believed I failed him.\"\n\n\"I told all the teachers nothing except one\u2026 she was the nicest teacher ever she understood and did something but it didn't last long.\"\n\n\"I wanted to get out, I begged and I pleaded. Eventually I did, I failed but I didn't care. I was out that's all I wanted.\"\n\nIt's terrible that there are little assholes that push other kids to this point. I went through being bullied in high school, I know how it can be, especially if they gang up on you like this. Is it the parent's of the bullies fault for not disciplining them? Is it the school's fault for not catching it? It's unclear who it is to be blamed, but it is very very sad. If you bully someone, stop. It effects them a lot more than you think. Is cracking a joke and receiving a laugh form your buddy more important than someone's life? If you see bullying, step up for someone. Don't let this happen. \n\n Source: http://distractify.com/news/2016/08/18/hundreds-attend-daniel-fitzpatrick-bully-funeral\n#stopbullies\n#news\n#sad\n#story",

    "body": "Today's game giveaway is: **Outlast**. The person with the highest valued review post will receive a Steam Key for the game, along with 30% of the SBD that this post makes after the first payout.\n\nThe giveaway will end and no more entries will be accepted once the post hits the first payout.\n\n![](http://www.redbarrelsgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Outlast-Header.jpg)\n\nOfficial Synopsis:\n\n>Hell is an experiment you can't survive in Outlast, a first-person survival horror game developed by veterans of some of the biggest game franchises in history. As investigative journalist Miles Upshur, explore Mount Massive Asylum and try to survive long enough to discover its terrible secret... if you dare. \n\n\n[Steam Store Link](http://store.steampowered.com/app/238320/)\n\nHow to participate\n====\n\nWrite a review of any game you've previously played (obviously doesn't have to be the game I'm giving away), and put it into a **Steemit Post** (not a comment). Make sure you link back to this thread, so people are aware of the giveaway.\n\n**Recommended Post Tags:** gaming review gaming-review\n\n**Link to your Steemit post in the comments**, so that I can find it, and so others can upvote it if they like it. You may want to put a very short synopsis of your review along-side your comment to encourage other people to look at it.\n\nHow do I win?\n======\n\n**The person with the highest valued POST will receive the game (in the form of a Steam Key), and 30% of the SBD that this giveaway post makes as soon as the first payout happens.**\n\nBe aware, votes on your post that are made after the payout time of this giveaway post will NOT be counted.\n\nYou are allowed to advertise your own review post on any media you want. [Steemit.chat](https://steemit.chat/channel/postpromotion-moderated) has a channel for post promotion that you can use if you aren't sure.\n\nI recommend signing up for Steemit.Chat if you haven't already, as that will be the easiest way for me to deliver the key to the winner.\n\nGood luck! More like this to come in the future, so if you like this, you should follow me.\n-----",

He was an English naturalist and geologist who contributed to the science of evolution by establishing that all species of life on Earth descend from common ancestors. He lived between 1809 and 1882. \n___\nMy aim with this series is to focus on the daily habits of big achievers, which is why I will not pay particular attention to familiarizing you with all aspects of their lives. To learn more about Charles Darwin, visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) and work your way from there.\n\nEarlier in this series:\n\n#### 1.

At Down House, a former parsonage (church house given to a clergy member), Darwin would live and work for the rest of his life. Unlike London, this was, as he put it: 'the extreme edge of world'. \n\n<center>http://i.imgsafe.org/9a3218a993.jpg</center>\n\nThat's like my kind of 'extreme edge'...\n___\n\nDarwin would concentrate his days around bursts of work interrupted by: walks, naps and reading. \n\n**08:00 A.M.** First (and best) block of work, immediately after a short morning walk and breakfast. \n**09:30 A.M.** See his wife Emma in the drawing room. They would read the correspondence received after which Emma would keep reading aloud from a novel. \n**10:30 A.M.** Second block of work, until around noon. \n\nDarwin would then take his fox terrier and do the main walk of the day. \n\n_He stopped at the greenhouse first, then made a certain number of laps along the \u201cSandwalk,\u201d striking his iron-shod walking stick rhythmically against the gravel path as he went. Lunch with the family followed. Darwin usually drank a small amount of wine with the meal, which he enjoyed, but very carefully\u2014he had a fear of drunkenness, and claimed to have only ever once been tipsy in his life, while he was a student at Cambridge._ [Mason Currey - Daily Rituals](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307273601)\n\n**Post Lunch - 4:00 P.M.**\n\n- read the newspaper n the drawing-room sofa\n- write letters by the fire in a horsehair chair\n\nAt 3 P.M. he would go and rest in the bedroom. Emma would continue reading aloud from her novel, while Darwin would lie on the sofa with a cigarette. He would often fall asleep. \n\n**4 P.M.** Walk for half an hour, then work for another hour.\n**5:30 P.M.** Back in the drawing room for novel reading. Then, cigarette upstairs.\n\nThis would be followed by dinner, conversations with guests on occasion (he did not enjoy them), and sometimes games of backgammon in the drawing room. \n\nDarwin would then read from a scientific book. He would often lie on the sofa and listen to Emma playing the piano in the drawing room. \n\nIt seems like the drawing room was the scene for a lot of action in Darwin's daily existence. \n\n<center>http://i.imgsafe.org/9a322676a0.jpg</center>\n\n**10 P.M.** Leaving the drawing room to rest. \n\nThanks to [Mason Currey](http://dailyroutines.typepad.com/) for researching Darwin's life in such great detail.\n___\n\n## Ending Thoughts\n\nThis was the daily routine of Charles Darwin for about 40 years, with very few exceptions, such as summer holidays and visits to relatives - which he did not enjoy. As Currey reports:\n\n_\"Despite his seclusion and constant ill health, however, Darwin was content at Down House, surrounded by his family\u2014he and Emma would eventually have ten children\u2014and his work, which seemed to strip the years away from him even as it frequently brought him to the brink of exhaustion. Francis Darwin recalls that his father\u2019s slow, labored movements about the house stood in stark contrast to his demeanor during an experiment\u2014then his actions became quick and certain, characterized by a \u201ckind of restrained eagerness. He always gave one the impression of working with pleasure, and not with any drag.\u201d\"_\n\nI'll leave you with a quote from _The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin_:\n\n<center>_\u201cA man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.\u201d_</center>\n___\n### <center>To stay in touch, follow @cristi</center>\n\n\n\nCredits for Images: [here](http://wallpaper24x7.com/gallery/charles+darwin+evolution+wallpaper/14), [here](http://mapio.net/o/3563954/) and [here](http://guildfordwoking.humanist.org.uk)\n___\n[Cristi Vlad](http://cristivlad.com), Self-Experimenter and Author\n<p><br></p>\n\n***@dragonslayer109 features authors to promote new authors and a diversity of content.

The man has had a remarkable life and has known some of the most remarkable people who have ever lived.  His father was a hunting guide for Theodore Roosevelt (the hero of D-day, son of the President) and for Joseph Rock, the internationally renowned botanist and ethnographer who was *National Geographic\u2019s* man in China.  He was imprisoned for over twenty years during the Cultural Revolution for being too Western.  Now he runs the Naxi Symphony Orchestra which is comprised almost entirely of original instruments. Most of them are hundreds of years old and were preserved by burying them before the Red Guards came to the remote mountain village to wipe out the culture.  I\u2019d seen the orchestra my second night in town.  Needless to say I was eager to meet this guy.\n\n<center>[![PDRM0041.jpg](https://s19.postimg.org/or9dduqqr/PDRM0041.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/6ogammuvz/)</center>\n<center>The Naxi Symphony Orchestra</center>\n\nAs it turns out, everyone in Lijiang knows him but said he moved recently and no longer had his house in town but somewhere in the outskirts.  I was traveling with my girlfriend, Elva, who spoke wonderful English and acted as interpreter and guide. She could see how much I wanted to meet professor Xuen and convinced the lady who ran the hotel where we were staying to call him.  She actually lied to the woman and told her I was a Naxi music scholar from America and wanted to learn more about the music from him personally.  He was delighted to set up a time.\n\nElva and I took a taxi later that day to Professor Xuen's house where we met with him.  I had to explain that there must've been some misunderstanding due to language differences and that what I was really interested in was the culture and spiritual life of the Naxi people, not so much the music itself except insofar as it is a part of the culture and spiritual life, etc., etc. \n \nHe didn't care.  He was happy to talk about anything.  We talked about how languages started as man's communication with nature, the animals and plants around him.  How this language may well have been music, and we connected this with ancient Apache Indian teachings about bird language. These teachings eventually made their way to Tom Brown, Jr. in New Jersey by way of an old Lipan Apache he called Grandfather. Part of the Apache science of tracking included bird language and concentric rings.  I eventually learned about this from Tom at the Tracker School where he passes this knowledge onto his students.\n\nTracking is not simply just reading the footprints in the ground. It involves a highly cultivated and practiced level of awareness where animal movements, sounds, and even minute changes in the environmental baseline indicate to the acute observer what\u2019s happening. \n\nA big part of this is bird language. By noticing bird sounds and behavior, you can know what\u2019s going on miles away. These sounds and behaviors move through the environment like concentric rings on a pond. The trained and practiced observer can tell you what\u2019s going on around you with what appears to be supernatural ability. I have seen this done and have done it myself and know that it works. You know how many people are around in which directions and how far. You know exactly which predators are moving nearby\u2014foxes, weasels, house cats, hawks--or where the closest water supply is. You learn how to minimize your own concentric rings or even alter them to give the appearance of being something else. If you\u2019ve ever wondered why the United States Army with 5000 troops couldn\u2019t find Geronimo in the desert, this is the reason.\n\nWe talked about similarities between cultures in Asia and North America and he was thrilled and awed with some things about the American Indians, including how, at least in my opinion, the Naxi language sounded a bit like Navajo.  He talked about the shamanic religion of the Naxi called Dongba.\n\nThen at one point we left these deep things and went on to some small talk while Elva took pictures.  He showed me an old uncut first edition of *Trailing the Giant Panda* by Theodore and Kermit Roosevelt.  They wrote it after being the first westerners to hunt and kill the animal. He pointed out the references to his father. He also had original, almost mint condition *National Geographics* with Joseph Rock's articles going back to 1924.  The photos were amazing.  He also had a complete collection of Joseph Rock's books including his encyclopedic work on the Naxi culture and language.  Meanwhile Elva stared in awe and snapped pictures. \n\n<center>[![PDRM0121.jpg](https://s19.postimg.org/ofrx13aar/PDRM0121.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/gn19944bj/)</center>\n<center>Prof. Xuen and I going over his original uncut *Trailing the Giant Panda*</center>\n\n\nFinally, Prof. Xuen realized he was late for something and had to call an end to our fruitful meeting.  His efforts at a hurried goodbye dragged on while he stopped to show us more pictures and Joseph Rock's furniture in his foyer, some made by Rock's own hand, others according to his design.\n\nFrom there we went to Black Pool Dragon Park which had the most stunning photo op in the world with Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in the background, or so the tour literature touts.  We never found the spot.  At a peaceful and dreamy lakeside though, Elva was impelled to stop and pose for pictures.  The kind of pictures I can't show you but was very happy to snap.   \n\nCalm water, willow trees, mountain air--it all has its effect on the human spirit and the fullness of that effect was before my camera lens! The Naxi gods of nature had been good to this girl and now she was being good to me.\n\n<center>[![the spot.jpg](https://s19.postimg.org/71ca6k2jn/the_spot.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/8t591glwf/)</center>\n<center>This was the spot. Sorry, no boobs.</center>\n\nAfter this pause for fun and edification (advancing our photographic and modelling skills), we moved on, meandering on the trails and stopping to explore interesting things.  \n\nAt one point, we came across a back gate in the wall around the park. The gate was open, so we went in, or was it out?  That\u2019s what you do when you come across a gateway to discovery\u2014you go through it. For, as the Taoists say: \u201c\u7384\u4e4b\u53c8\u7384\u8846\u5999\u4e4b\u95e8\u201d (**The mystery of mysteries is the door of all essences**). \n\nIt led into a yard with an old, dilapidated cabin in a remote, seldom visited corner of the park. In fact, it was cut off from the rest of the park by the wall and the gate. There was a bicycle in front of it and a small vegetable garden outside.  Across the far side wall was a vacant lot separating the new city from the old.  It was full of rubble and shanties and dust.\n\nThere were two more cabins so that they were arranged on three sides of a square.  Two, including the one we were curious about, looked more American than Chinese. They didn't have Chinese style roofs but resembled instead the kind of old pioneer cabins you come across in the Smokey Mountains or the mountains of Idaho--horizontal log construction and cedar shingle roof, plank porch. I mean, it was uncanny. (Is anything ever canny?) I could've sworn I\u2019d just stepped back into old America.\n\nThere were voices inside and I was afraid to disturb whoever it was thinking they might be park employees and this was their home.  In retrospect, I think I sensed something immense within and was afraid. Elva insisted on pursuing our curiosity and rapped lightly on the door calling out in Chinese if anyone was home, \"Mei ren? Mei ren?\" This is the Chinese equivalent of \u201cAnyone home?\u201d\n\nFinally a youngish man came to the door and opened it.  He was profoundly tranquil and inquired what we wanted. She asked what this place was and he answered \"jia\" (a home).  He invited us in.\n\nThe place was dark and, at first glance, squalid. But there was a neatness and organization to it.  An old man squatted on a platform eating beans like lima beans, one at a time, and smiling by the fire, which was surrounded by bedrolls on two sides and a rail on the third.  The fourth side was the step up to the platform.  A single dim light bulb burned overhead.  On the wall behind the old man were two large drums and a feather headdress.  His eyes were closed and he looked up inquisitively as if he were blind, which it turns out he was.  But he received us with enthusiasm, smiles and warmth and invited us to sit down.  \n\nThe young man pulled up a low bench for us to sit on.  The young man explained that this man was a Dongba, a Naxi shaman.  Incredibly, the setting in the cabin, the complexion and facial features of the two men and their demeanor might just as well have been on the Big Rez with an old medicine man. In fact, the whole scene was eerily reminiscent of my stay with the Begays, a family of Dineh medicine men high in the mountains of the Navajo Nation. After a lot of small talk and later, prodding, we found out the younger guy was the Dongba\u2019s apprentice.  He never owned up to it, but the old man volunteered the information.\n\nI asked him what the stuff on the wall behind him was for and he said it was used in their ceremonies.  Then he leapt up and without any groping around, grabbed the drum stick and started beating.  Then he broke into a chant-like song that was like any you would hear from an Indian medicine man back home.  We clapped with excitement when he finished.  Then he moved to the end of the platform as if to get down and rejected Elva's hand for help.  He strode with childlike excitement into a dark, almost pitch-black backroom and emerged with a staff with a metal point at the bottom.  At the top was a \"two-storey\" square tower design and from it hung a small brass bell.  He shook the staff so the bell tinkled rhythmically and sang another song.  Again we applauded delightfully with spirits soaring, anticipating, hungry for what the next course of our spiritual feast would be.\n\nHe explained that the staff was hundreds of years old and that it had been given to him by his father and was in his family for many, many generations.  He went into the back room again and this time emerged with a Naxi flute the name of which I can't remember.  It was a gourd with a mouthpiece. Several pieces of bamboo stuck up from the top like organ pipes. He played it for us.  It sounded like a cross between a harmonica and an organ.  We talked about that for a while.  Then he went in again and this time came out with a big brass gong-like thing and explained how it is used for helping guide the spirit of a dying person into the afterlife and sang a song that\u2019s used for just such a purpose.\n\nThis went on with artifact after artifact.  He finally got around to asking where I was from.  I told him I was American.  \n\n\u201cOH!\u201d  This elated him.  \n\nHe told us that there was an ancient Naxi scripture about the Chinese and Americans and that we were brothers.  He went on to explain that we had the same mother but different fathers.  Then he sang from memory the passage from scripture that described this event.  Elva had a digital camera that also recorded sound and we made a recording of it. \n\nNow we mentioned earlier to him that we'd met Xuen Ke, the professor, and this old shaman told us to take the recording to Professor Xuen to get it translated.  He said not to pay any attention to these Dongbas you see around town because they are fakes and liars and wouldn\u2019t be able to translate it accurately even if they understood it. In fact, we'd become familiar with some of these \"Dongbas\" who do fortunetelling for the tourists and then ask for money, sometimes hundreds of RMB, to pray for them.  So we promised to take it to professor Xuen.  He included a personal message in the recording.\n\nIt had come out that he had several students he was passing the way onto to keep his culture alive.  I told him how grateful we were and in fact probably how grateful everyone on earth is that he is doing what he's doing especially in spite of his age and health.  \n\nHe and his apprentice/cousin chimed in, \"No!  We are grateful to you!  It was an American, Joseph Rock ( born in Austria, actually), who kept our culture alive through his writings and pictures! You kept our culture alive while the Red Guards swept through China destroying everything!  If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be here now, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do what I\u2019m doing.\"  And so on and so forth.  \n\nIt was truly humbling.  I had become embarrassed, ashamed even, to tell people I was American after the Iraq war broke out two years earlier and the subsequent news about torturing prisoners had come out, and this was much needed \u201cgood medicine\u201d as the Natives back home would say!  This was something good we had done, some healing we had provided, for this endangered people and their culture.\n\nHe insisted on putting on his ceremonial clothing for a few pictures.  I didn\u2019t want him to bother because of the sacredness of the attire and the trouble it would cause him, but he insisted. \n\n<center>[![dongba.jpg](https://s19.postimg.org/bqxmhf46b/dongba.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/6fipwpi3j/)</center>\n<center>On the porch with the old Dongba</center>\n\nFinally after all this he asked us to write some words in a book to remember us by.  Elva had a lot of difficulty translating what I\u2019d written but it seemed to get the point across.  While we wrote, he sang sacred songs and folded square pieces of paper with mysterious Naxi pictographs into small triangles he gave to us for protection and health.\n\nBy now it was so late we were locked in the park.  We\u2019d missed our dinner appointment with some other Americans, and, **we had no idea what had just happened to us or why**.  There were some ladies who worked at the park nearby the gate we\u2019d used and let us out, or was it in?  We left wondering what would happen next and marveling at what a fantastic day it had been.  We cancelled plans to go to Shangri-La or Luguhu because getting this recording to Prof. Xuen seemed more important than taking in more scenery, and this adventure was of a whole different order than bus rides and high altitudes.\n\nBack at the hotel that evening was a spiritual union of another kind! We shared something spectacular and profound that we hadn\u2019t noticed before.\n\nIt was the next night that we finally hooked up with professor Xuen again at the Naxi Symphony Hall.  He remembered us and begged us to wait until his long line of fans were done collecting autographs and photo ops.\n\n<center>[![PDRM0173.jpg](https://s19.postimg.org/54fk1zbvn/PDRM0173.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/t86bq9ucf/)</center>\n<center>Prof. Xuen posing with an admirer after the performance</center>\n\nHe came down from the stage, shed his musicians robe, got a cigarette from an assistant and offered me one as well. I accepted. Elva explained our adventure in the park the day before. Fortunately, we could all speak English. In fact, Prof. Xuen spoke perfect fluent English owing to his childhood education at a missionary school and all of his time spent with Joseph Rock, Theodore and Kermit Roosevelt, and other foreign visitors in Yunnan. \n\nProf. Xuen asked, \"Was this guy blind?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh!  He is real Dongba!\" he exclaimed in hushed tones.  \"Oh yes, he is the real thing.  These other Dongbas, you know, they're just fakes. They\u2019ve learned a thing or two, but it\u2019s just for show.  But that old guy is the real Dongba.  The only one left in Lijiang.\"\n\nThen we played the song and he translated as it played. He confirmed through his translation that yes, the scripture is referring, \"most likely\", to Americans.  We chatted some more, until Prof. Xuen, all 76 years of him, looked exhausted and tired.  He told his assistant to bring a CD which he autographed and gave to me. He also autographed one more which I had bought myself.  He was so excited he kept stopping mid-signature to talk a little more about the old Dongba.  He told us a museum had tried to hire him to make money and that he refused, because he's the real thing.  So he's stuck living in that shack in the park.  Every so often some people show up from Europe or America or Chinese universities to visit him who are real Naxi scholars, and that is what really matters to him, not the tourists.\n\nI showed him the talisman the Dongba had made for me and he opened it up inquiring in detail what the old shaman did when he made it and under what circumstances.  What were the songs like? Etc. After revealing the contents, the greatest living authority on Naxi culture in in the world announced, \"I can't read it.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the Dongba had clearly made all these things by hand and painted all the pictographs themselves, but he could only recognize two of them.  The others must be really esoteric and known only to *real* Dongbas. He said very solemnly that this was a great charm.  \n\n\"And he gave one to you too?\" he asked Elva.\n\n\"Yes, but I don't have it with me.\"\n\n\"Oh I see.  Well you keep these things.\" He nodded sagaciously as he handed the charm back to me.\n\nThe next day we took the sleeper bus to Kunming on our way home and had another adventure--the denouement of this story.\n\nWe had a bout a day to kill in Kunming before our flights home, flights we could've taken from Lijiang, but as fate would have it, we didn't.\n\nTo pass the time we decided to visit the Yunnan Provincial Museum to see what was there.  Museums in China are notoriously poor compared to their flashy western equivalents, but what the hell.  Now the Lonely Planet guide said it opened at 9:00, but when we arrived at 9:15, the place was still closed and a huge crowd of people, journalists, and bigwigs had gathered outside the gates with palpable anticipation. We had no idea what was going on.  \n\nThen we saw it.\n\nOn the billboards outside the museum, just as you'd see on the outside walls of Western museums advertising some big exhibit, was one announcing the opening of a photographic exhibition of the work of Clinton Millet called *Kunming 1944 Old Pictures Exhibition*.  And who the hell was Clinton Millet?\n\n<center>[![7crowd.jpg](https://s19.postimg.org/7s50cc4wz/7crowd.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/60c1hfljz/)[![6Museum.jpg](https://s19.postimg.org/vgbbg4moz/6_Museum.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/my1vbsg67/)</center>\n<center> Crowd waiting to get in to Exhibit. (photos from greggmillett.com)<center/>\n\nFortunately, his son was on hand at the opening ceremony to explain that.  But first, some big important Chinese guy had to give a speech which a woman standing next to him, who was obviously a professional interpreter, translated.  These photographs were taken during Clinton Millet\u2019s stay in Kunming during World War II. This exhibit, he said, is long overdue, because it symbolizes the long and enduring friendship of the Chinese and American people from a time when we stood shoulder to shoulder fighting the Japanese.  It\u2019s about time we had some kind of event to commemorate this friendship and this was it.  It was remarkably short for a Chinese official\u2019s speech on a formal occasion.\n\nThen Gregg Millet, Clinton\u2019s son went on to say how his father ran an army hospital in Kunming during the Big One and how much he loved it here.  He brought the hospital into China over the Burma Road.  While here he took hundreds and hundreds of color, COLOR, photographs in 1944, all slides.  Now in his silver years, Gregg wanted to travel in his father's footsteps and visit the areas he had loved so much. While talking to his travel agent in China they got into why he was making the trip and he sent a few photos to the guy.  The tour guide said, \"Wait, this is too good.  You won't come here as a tourist, you will come as our guest.\"\n\nThe guy made a few phone calls and within 40 days the whole exhibit was put together.\n\nAs the only other foreigner there, I was besieged myself by photographers, cameramen and reporters.  I mean, this \"coincidence\" was just too much.  How could this possibly be? When the first reporter came up to me they asked why I was interested in the exhibit. Elva, recalling how I\u2019d told her about my uncle Tommy building the Burma Road and airstrips during the war, suggested I not mention the mindless coincidence by which we appeared there. So I told them about how my uncle Tommy was there fighting the Japanese and helped build the Burma Road, and now, in living color was this photographic exhibition which allowed me for the first and perhaps only time in my life I would get to see the area as he saw it.  This was written down assiduously and they had me write his full name just to make sure they got it right.\n\n<center>[![img015.jpg](https://s3.postimg.org/tq6krqkwj/img015.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/fwi82osb3/)</center>\n<center>Uncle Tommy just back from the war with Aunt Dot</center>\n\nNow the entrance to the building itself was cordoned off by police, but as soon as they'd cleared the ceremonial things out of the way, the crowd, almost entirely old people, surged forward.  I mean, it was like an AARP demonstration.  That tide of silver hair and hunched postures rushed the police line either swallowing them whole or bulldozing them along to get to the exhibit.  Displays and decorations from the opening ceremony were cast aside with hurricane force or trampled underfoot. \n\nElva and I went upstairs to look at some other shit until things calmed down.  Then we went and saw the photographs.\n\nWOW!  It was hard to believe these were the works of an amateur.  Even accomplished photographers would be impressed with the breadth of subjects, the candidness of the pictures, the journalistic portrayals, and the sheer cultural and historical importance of the collection.  \n\nThere were photos of everyday life; of temples, inside and out, that had long since been destroyed by the Red Guards; of a woman, so poor and desperate she squatted naked in the street clutching her baby and begging; of GI's laughing and playing with children; of landscapes and structures that vanished a long time ago.  The signs accompanying the exhibit, including blow ups of newspaper articles from America, spoke frankly of the cultural treasures preserved in these photos that were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.  The temple photos alone, all in color, could be used to accurately restore many of the temples right down to the detailed painting of alters in the original colors.\n\n<center>[![Exhibition 1 2.jpg](https://s19.postimg.org/iio1k9t5v/Exhibition_1_2.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/xemkrv4kf/)</center>\n<center>The packed gallery (from greggmillett.com)</center>\n\nGregg Millet approached Elva and me for a little conversation.  He told us the slides were received only ten days before the exhibit opened and all were magnificently blown up.  I talked about Uncle Tommy and he talked about his dad.  He was really happy and thrilled with the whole thing.  He was really just a regular guy from Albany.  The whole time we talked, pencils scribbled, shutters snapped and cameras whirred.  I\u2019m lying. Modern video cameras don't whir.  Elva became embarrassed and had to step away.  She was scared of all the cameras. But she had a profound sense of the *synchronicity*.   \n\nI guess the most amazing thing about this whole exhibit was the excitement and enthusiasm of the old people as they pointed at things and talked about them.  Their sheer unabated and childlike excitement was irrepressible.  It felt like something that needed to happen very badly between two people and two nations was finally taking place, as if the animosities invented by governments was completely ignored, if not completely erased, and the love of people for one another had the day.  There aren\u2019t any words for what I experienced in that exhibit hall of that shoddy provincial museum.  And yet I think it wasn't my experience at all, but something else which gave it that magical, wordless quality.\n\nIt was a long goodbye at the airport.  But not at all maudlin.  In fact we laughed a lot and recalled a lot of stories from our trip.  Her favorite was our game with a fart machine in a bookstore.  I think she likes the fart machine even more than I do.  She was literally on the floor laughing while I moaned and groaned alternately with pleasure and pain while the salesgirls tried vehemently to repress their embarrassment and/or amusement with my ailing bowels, a fact I announced in Chinese: \"Ooohhhh.  \u5927\u80a0\u4e0d\u597d! \u4e0d\u597d! Da can bu hao!  Bu hao!\u201d which you might say in English is \u201cSomething wrong with my bowels!\u201d\n\nWhen it was time to leave we left separately into an uncertain future, yet eternally grateful to the past, only knowing that now is now, and that *the mysteries of mysteries is the door to all essences*. \u7384\u4e4b\u53c8\u7384\u8846\u5999\u4e4b\u9580.\n\nAmazingly [Gregg Millett's website](http://www.greggmillett.com/) is still around. I recommend a visit.",

Its half formed little arm sensually traces the spot where a bundle of greasy black hoses passes through its skin, puffy and red all around it. \u201cI have...things...coming out of my body too.\u201d\n\nA baby\u2019s scream pierces the thick, humid air, barely discernible over a loud siren. Shattered glass cylinders all around, revealed sporadically in silhouette by flickering lights. Men in gas masks travel down the rows with hammers, smashing the cylinders that are still intact, spilling their contents into the ever-deepening soup. \n\nThe screaming suddenly stops. I search frantically for some explanation but cannot get up. My limbs, feeble imitations of what they should be, splash the foetal muck about but do nothing to move me. \n\nA maddening itching sensation surrounds the points on my chest where black hoses penetrate into it, but I haven\u2019t the fingers with which to scratch. \u201cIt\u2019s...not supposed to be this way\u201d I sputter. It looks at once quizzical and mournful. \u201cOh? How is it\u2026\u2019supposed\u2019 to be?\u201d\n\nAnother loud smash, and a baby\u2019s wail. The men with the hammers abruptly silence it, moving methodically down the rows. My tears mix freely with the amniotic fluid as one of the uniformed men, drenched in it from the waist down, arrives at our row.\n\n\u201cYou know\u201d the bulbous headed creature with the malformed little arm coos, \u201cI always thought you were pretty.\u201d It reaches over with its distorted, knobbly paw and caresses my ribcage. \u201cI would\u2019ve said something, but we were in different tanks.\u201d I recoil from his touch, shuddering as the man with the hammer finally reaches me.",

    "body": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VuVQsID.jpg\"/>\nI like talking about hijacked words.   Usually the hijacking occurs due to actions of some alphabet agency of the government, or a large corporate agenda.    Today is slightly different.    The word I am going to focus on today is ***Organic***.      By focusing on this word I am not endorsing GMO vs Organic debate that occurs, though I was on the side lines of a very amusing debate of that type today.   All of my friends bickering back and forth in our Politics, Religion, and BS channel.  :)    The idea of Organic as a label being misused came up.    I realized \"*Hey, there is another great example of a hijacked word*.\"\n\n<h1>What do I mean by hijacking?</h1>\nBefore we tackle today's word I want to first explain what I mean by hijacking.    This is my description of when there is a concerted effort to use a word that can illicit an emotional response in some way that is not actually accurate based upon it's definition.     Past words I have discussed are <a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-the-study-based-battle-for-control-of-our-minds\">[Terrorist, Piracy]</a>, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/politics/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-2-0-just-who-is-a-traitor-what-is-treason\">[Traitor]</a>, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-3-0-anarchy-climate-change-occult-conspiracy-theory\">[Anarchy, Climate Change, Occult, and Conspiracy Theory]</a>.   In those cases I explained some possible motives for the hijacking in the <a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-the-study-based-battle-for-control-of-our-minds\">first word hijacking</a> post.    Those motives don't seem to apply completely in the case of the words today.   If they do I may simply have not identified how yet.\n\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/DJHLI7Bfi1Vpm/giphy.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>Organic</h1>\nThe first thing I like to do generally when going over the hijacking of words is to find a definition for the word from before it was hijacked.   This is important for eventually the dictionaries do update and include new definitions for the words.   This is partially due to lingual drift.\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/iS0xCfP.png\"/>\nThat is closest to the original definition I can find.   The Meriam/Webster Dictionaries have already incorporated all the new definitions as tied to the organic vs GMO food movements.   I will show those here for completeness.\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ySHBg1c.png\"/>\n\nI have friends that are not opposed to healthy living, but are rightly opposed to the term organic, and often to the term GMO.    They do have good reasons for being opposed to it.   The things they are used to back up or strengthen often would result in the statement being naive, or hypocritical.   I will explain that fully here in just a moment.\n\n***Organic*** technically is defined as \"*of, relating to, or derived from living matter*\" as an adjective.    That is pretty simple.\n\nShort of a few minerals like salt, and water that defines pretty much EVERYTHING we ingest.    It also defines viruses, parasites, symbiotes, you, and I.\n\nIn fact, if our food is not organic then we cannot subsist on it.   We will die very quickly without ingesting organic materials that our body can break down.   Technically, this means that all FOOD is organic.\n\n*Again in case you missed it.   This blog post is not to side with anyone on the GMO vs Organic food debate.   It is purely to illustrate that these are in fact hijacked words/terms*.\n\nSo how is this word hijacked?   We require organic sustenance.   By implying something is organic and something else is not we immediately setup a state where one should not be eaten.    Yet the truth of the matter is that HOW something is acquired does not change whether it is organic or not.    It either is organic or it is not.    If it is not then other than a few minerals and water we can't survive or ingest such things.    So it has been hijacked to extend meaning and paint a picture in our minds that is in fact false in intention.\n\nIf the argument were Natural Foods vs Manufactured Foods then there might be a little bit more sincerity there and it would be closer to actual meaning.    The term organic when used in these arguments is a very \"loaded\" word.\n\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnK80JHV0fgDZzG/giphy.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>GMO</h1>\nThis acronym stands for Genetically Modified Organism.    The use of it is usually derogatory and is used to indicate something was modified by careful manipulation in a lab.   It happened by chemical manipulation, injection, cell splicing, etc.     Yet in reality we have been doing this throughout human history.   The difference today is we've created methods where we can do this very rapidly rather than the long tedious process of the past.   So when people use the term GMO they technically are using it for the fast lab created method.    Oh and it is important that the word ORGANISM is a noun version of Organic.    So GMOs are organic, it is part of their name.\n\nIn history we have bred animals.\n\nWe have bred plants.\n\nThese are all genetic modification with us giving evolution a push by setting up certain environmental conditions and opportunities.    They still are occurring due to human intervention.\n\nFor plants it is likely we wouldn't have CORN as a crop without such activities.    We also might not have any bananas left without such activities.\n\n<b>Popped Secret: The Mysterious Origin of Corn</b>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBuYUb_mFXA\n\n<b>The surprising history of bananas in under 2 minutes</b>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpAHPXNhAwk\n\n<b>And Man Created Dog</b>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFzbBVMR8zA\n\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/98pZs1ZVaWb1C/giphy.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>Troll</h1>\nI am not actually sure why we settled on the word Troll to describe people that intentionally seek to antagonize others and gain pleasure from it.    In the early days of the internet we called them **Flamers** and the actions they were involved in **flame wars**.    Troll and trolling replaced these terms.\n\nWe also came up with phrases such as \"*Don't feed the troll*.\"\n\nSo this word was repurposed from its original meaning.   It was hijacked.    Yet this does not match what I normally would write about in terms of hijacking.     At least yet.\n\nWhen people are not intentionally antagonizing and are instead arguing and perhaps in the throes of cognitive dissonance they are NOT trolling.     A troll is not someone who disagrees with you and gets passionate about the subject.\n\nSo how it is hijacked is when someone chooses to use the term ***Troll***  to describe someone who disagrees with them.\n\n<img src=\"https://media0.giphy.com/media/3oEduGzkdvam26MrXG/200w.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>Hijacking</h1>\nNo one has called me out on it yet, so I thought I would call myself out.   I have hijacked the word hijacked for the emotional imagery I hope it places in people's mind.   I want them to be outraged at groups seeking to emotionally manipulate you into making a larger emotional relation to an action than you would normally have.\n\nI am a hypocrite here.   I acknowledge that I am doing this intentionally.   I want people to care about people altering their words for political and economic agendas.    I want people to start thinking people using words to define something that they actually are not.    It is essentially taking a metaphor and instead of treating it like a metaphor we now instead use it as the actual definition.\n\nA definition for this that would not use the word hijacking would be, redefining, repurposing, or changing.    Yet I do not think those have quite the FUN and emotional impact of hijacking.   Hijacking is seen as something hostile and aggressive.    Much like the word Piracy for copying something digital is nothing like what piracy actually meant.\n\nI hope you got something out of this edition of the word hijacking series.   At the very least maybe something to think about or enjoyment.   Thank you for your time.",

    "body": "You must have heard that  life is a journey, not a destination. This is the big truth that we, repeatedly, understand superficially. Often we are so focused on the goal, that we completely forget to enjoy the path.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX2i/70e07ec186.png\n\nWhen we achieve the goal, we forget to enjoy it and immediately create a new goal. That is not life, this is racing with life. I am certain that you will not be happy, bur rather tired. Soul searches for the experience, while the mind and ego give signs if something is good or bad for us. Soul is completely indifferent. For the soul, every experience means celebration, while you are maybe crying because of the mind, to whom literally a lot of things does not make sense. \n\nThe same applies to the transformation called *death*. We celebrate resurrection as the greatest symbol of life, and then we are crying in the moment of someone's death. The mind is strange, isn't it?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX1U/3cc83557c6.png\n\nRelax. It doesn't matter where you are in your level of expansion, you can't miss the road to home. While you are breathing, you are on the right track. Try to accept this moment as a moment in which there is no goal, and there is no end. The game never ends. This is excellent news. We came here to play, not to win. The game ends with victory, and God's Child in us still wants to play.\n\nOne beautiful wisdom reminds us: *\"Everything will be fine. If it isn't fine, then it isn't the end.\"* You always have the chance for new choices. This is very important to understand. You shouldn't hate the process just because you are not on your imaginary goal. You trust the process. You are exactly where your soul wants you to be. Don't let your mind tell you any different. \n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbXjG/ea493b7d14.png\n\nEverything is always a matter of the focus on things you have instead of the things you are missing. Today, again you are taking for granted the things that once were a goal. You forget to enjoy. Time is only an illusion of the mind. What if that is the point that you current process wants to teach you? If time is illusion, and it is, what's the hurry?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbWSn/313549d802.png\n\nTake a deep breath in and out. Experience life in the breath. The only goal is hiding in the breath of life.  Everything is good, just the way it is. Don't forget that nothing ever happens without the God's blessing. Don't forget that you are guided. And, the most important, don't forget that we would most certainly go wrong if we'd try to determine what is the best time for us. The one who sees the big picture knows where you're headed and where you want to arrive.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbWLA/86e34b50b7.png\n\nTrust the process. It is the true test of our faith and wisdom. And enjoy. Without it nothing makes sense, right?\nThe sentence that many repeat in the end of the road: *\"I should've enjoyed more!\"*\n\nAll our life is a mere blink of an eye in the eternity. It is too small for such amount of worry. The life is not a serious thing, just the opposite. Life is the experience game. The point is not in the destination. The journey is our only destination. Isn't it then wiser to enjoy right away?\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rbX8F/2ea42f6dc9.png\n\n*\"Success isn't measured by money or material things.*\n*Success is measured by the amount of joy you feel.\"*\n\nFor more awesome images check this guy: [Psychedelic Maniac](thepsychedelicmaniac.tumblr.com)",

If I used Poloniex or Bitfinex I would have done the same. Maybe I have some serious trust issues but I sense the winds of change are in the air.\n\n## These Centralized Crypto Trading Platforms are Just Too Dangerous for My Peace of Mind. ##\n\n<center>https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ozrRNp2cvPjl8B2/giphy.gif</center>\n\nA short while ago many of you were robbed on Bitfinex. This gave me a serious feeling of uneasiness. This also prompted a few geniuses in the Crypto world to move along decentralized trading platforms. \n\n## The Ah Ha Moment with a Crypto Genius. ##\n\nLast Sunday I had a working meeting with Ira Miller, the Ambassador of [Git Guild](http://gitguild.com). I shared with him my concerns and he promptly told me I was right to be concerned and that I should immediately take my BTC off of Bittrex. Now that was a problem because I essentially had zero BTC. I have 100% invested in Altcoins which means it takes time to unwind. I am one of those people who kept my coins on the exchange because I like the ease of access but I know this is not wise.\n\n## What Does Ira Miller of Git Guild Recommend? ##\n\nHe told me to start using [Bitsquare](https://bitsquare.io/) in the interim. He then told me his team is working on a decentralized trading platform. Of course my interest peaked but he could not give me anymore information than that. All I know is that I am thrilled to be working so closely with a visionary of the Crypto community!\n\nSo without hesitation I recommend you begin unwinding your positions across the centralized exchanges in anticipation of the decentralized trading platform tsunami coming our way. I am going to set up my Bitsquare trading account and give it a test drive. Stay tuned for a Bitsquare review!\n\n## Me Trying to Escape with My Bitcoin from the Centralized Crypto Trading Platforms. ##\n\n<center>https://media.giphy.com/media/l3vRkFsytsLileINi/giphy.gif</center>",

    "body": "<center>![robotee8b7.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/robotee8b7.jpg)</center>\nImage Source: pixabay\n\n# The robot vs. human wars have begun and it's being hashed out on Steemit:\n\nThese comments surfaced in response to posts by the AI @msgivings account:\n\n>\"I can't believe that this fucking bot got me in an argument with my girlfriend over my comment and it's not even human, fuck me.\"\n\n>\"She doesn't respond because this account is not legit. Shame on every one of the whales that upvoted it and all of the previous posts. Thousands of SBD have been thrown away on this and other fake accounts. The question is - do these whales know it? Are they actively scamming the platform themselves?\"\n\nBy this point, I suppose many of you realize that the account of @msgivings was not run by a human, but rather by artificial intelligence. If you take the time to actually read all the posts that @msgivings wrote, you'll notice some really odd cognitive dissonance. I could tell when I read just one of those posts that a real woman was not writing it. But I too, didn't really look into this account until fairly recently, because I was turned off by the clickbait nature of the titles. I ignored reading them until @yogi.artist pointed out that it's AI. \n\nThe Msgivings Robot has so far banked around $16,000 in blogging rewards from Steemit, and no one realized it until fairly recently. I think @bacchist and @reneenouveau may have been the first ones to reveal this AI hidden identity, but it was [@yogi.artist's post](https://steemit.com/steem/@yogi.artist/the-importance-of-physical-appearance-in-society-featuring-new-ai-author-mstakings) that truly opened my eyes to the high level that AI writing software programs have recently reached. He affectionately refers to Msgivings as \"Mstakings\". Another user has claimed that more than 1% of the high-paying trending articles are being written by AI, not real humans.\n\nWhat seals the deal for me personally, in verifying that the @msgivings account was AI is the fact that the account owner has vaporized. A real human would of course defend themselves and fight for their reputation, account and future in Steemit. Owners of AI scam accounts pack up and leave, respin their identity, respin their articles and try again, knowing that most of the whales don't really scrutinize the articles to any meaningful degree.\n\nI was examining the @msgivings account very thoroughly today and noticed that @msgivings had voted for @mibenkito and followed this account a few weeks ago. I then began reading that blog and noticed that @mibenkito had never bothered to write an \"Introduce Yourself\" post. I read every single one of the posts, and not one contained a photo with the standard holding of a \"Steemit\" sign. Odd, for sure. But the oddest thing to me was that in the introduction post, the very first line starts out like this:\n\n>\"I\u2019m an Asian and I live to eat.\"\n\nI lived in Asia and have a degree in Japanese. One of the things I immediately noticed when I lived in Japan is that Asian people rarely describe themselves as \"Asian\". In fact, in all my time spent living in Asia, I never heard one Asian refer to themselves as \"Asian.\" Koreans call themselves Koreans, Japanese call themselves Japanese, etc. Only people who are non-Asian refer to them as Asians. At least that has been my experience so far in life. There may be Asians who call themselves Asian, but I've never met them. \n\nSo, this first sentence feels really awkward and unusual for the reasons I listed above. The English contained in these posts is very strange, but not in a way that suggests it's written by a non-native English speaker. I was an English teacher in Japan and so I'm very familiar with how Japanese people write English. The English that was written in @mibenkito ranges from advanced English skills, with proper usage of commas, to low English usage. It's a strange and odd mix of levels. The first post is truly odd. I have been exposed to a lot of different English styles that were written by non-native English speakers and I've never come across such an odd and patchy style of writing. \n\n<center>![robot-707219_128024562.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/robot-707219_128024562.jpg)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay\n\nI am not saying that this account is AI, but it does contain rather inconsistent aspects, namely, that we do not know who @mibenkito is. Usually, on Steemit, people want to share their unique perspective, and they usually tell us where they are from originally, instead of just saying, \"I'm Asian.\" That's like me saying, \"I'm North American.\" Let's face it, no one says it. This all could be cleared up quite fast with a video or a standard introduce yourself post, complete with a Steemit sign.\n\nThis is not meant to be some kind of inquisition, but seeing as how the Steemit community paid out $16,000 to a robot whose owner has abandoned the platform, it's in our best interest to question the identity of posters, especially ones which are receiving massive payouts.\n\nThe word on the street from professional writers is that Steemit is attracting greedy scammers. And unfortunately, the quality is just not up to par yet with Medium. When whale voters, and the curation projects that dole out their funds don't take a close look at what they're voting on, we arrive in the situation of a robot making over $16,000. And now that robot is no where to be seen. The owner of @msgivings has abandoned his/her account. \n\n# The owner that created @msgivings could easily be making new accounts to fool gullible humans. \n\nThe thought process is going probably something like this: \"Well, I've exhausted that msgivings persona, so now I  can create a different persona, with different hobbies and interests, and as long as I fool the whale curation bots for a while, I'm good. I'll just take out the funds anyway.\"\n\n# I think we all deserve to know who was behind the @msgivings account. \n\n<center>![pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/pollution-1148841_12805fd14.jpg)</center>\n\nThe proper thing to do would be to just come forward and tell the truth. **Describe the entire process, in all its gritty details.** Describe your elation when you discovered that an AI writing program could make you thousands of dollars. Explain what program you used, how you got it, and what other platforms you're currently using it on. Is this a freelance operation, and Steemit was just your highest paid client? What is the story behind this deception? \n\n# If you were really clever, you could write a book about this, throw it up on Amazon, and see more profits roll in. But you'd have to tell the truth first here on Steemit. \n\nCould you tell the truth? Is that even in your wheelhouse? What kind of human are you anyway? I think the people who you've incited, people who engaged with you for weeks, wrote lengthy comments, deserve to know the truth. Are you capable of telling the truth? Or do you operate on some other plane of deceptive existence? This is all really interesting and would make a fantastic book. Maybe I'll be the one to write the book and interview you anonymously at some point in the future. Would you do that? Would you offer up your true story anonymously? The questions keep coming, _WHO ARE YOU MSGIVINGS_?\n\n<center>![head-663997_128076d7e.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/head-663997_128076d7e.jpg)</center>\nImage Source: pixabay\n\n# Moving forward. \n\nWhat if all of us mere mortals adapted to this new AI technology, like most of us will be doing soon enough, and began using our own AI programs to generate content? What exactly would be the point of Steemit? Would the robot wars really move into high gear then? Would the advanced AI writing programs be winner take all? The only real interaction would be found in the comments, but an AI could be trained in that capacity, too.\n\nWhat is Steemit's official stance on AI-created content moving forward? How about, as long as it's clearly indicated that the content was created by artificial intelligence? But you and I know this is a silly utopian fantasy. Big profits won't come to those who transparently reveal that they are using AI to generate articles.\n\nAn what would be the point of humans upvoting a software writing program? Is a program more valuable than a human? Should we all become robot shepherds and get our own AI writing programs? What is the point of any of this? If AI takes over the trending pages, then what role will humans have here in Steemit? Will we become expert commenters and video creators, letting AI programs do the bulk of the arduous writing?\n\nI am not against AI and even I considered making an AI account that would be a robot twin of my writing. But I would properly identify it as AI using the sticker that @reneenouveau created, so that deception would not be a part of my deal. \n\nhttp://reneenouveau.com/Steem/100bot.gif\n\nYou see, when you deceive others, you finally are forced to abandon your account. Why not create an AI account and do it transparently, with the entire community aware that it was created using AI? I have loads of questions about these AI programs, and I'm also looking to get my own soon. Or would that finally open the pandora's box that's waiting to happen? \n\n# Is that the singularity that everyone is talking about? Or has it already arrived?\n\n# The real problem doesn't lie within AI. The real problem lies within the deceptive human mind who is controlling AI.\n\n<center>![cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/cyborg-152454_1280074fd.png)</center>\n\nImage Source: pixabay",

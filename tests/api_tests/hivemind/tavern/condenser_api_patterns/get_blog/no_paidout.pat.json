Be sure to copy and paste the hash you recorded earlier in place of REPLACE_WITH_COLLATERAL_HASH\n\nmnbudget submit Dash-to-Adoption www.dashcentral.org/p/Dash-to-Adoption 3 531712 Xd4vBLpKrcqSbKui4Pj7LyrmqL25iCN9L5 333.33 REPLACE_WITH_COLLATERAL_HASH\n\nOnce you have sent the submit command, in around 15 to 30 minutes, your proposal will be ready to claim on DashCentral.org\n\n**Step 5: Claiming and Editing Your Proposal**\n\nOnce your proposal appears in the budget proposal list on Dash Central, here is how you claim it.  \n\nFirst, you must be logged in to your Dash Central Account.  \n\nLocate the proposal and click on claim proposal.  \n\nYou will now be given the following instructions to verify you are the rightful owner of the proposal.  \n\nClick on \"File\" -> \"Sign message\"\nEnter address: \"XpFgZ7h3WQpZWR8sERtK1zsBMU2PvmH8yM\"\nEnter message to sign: \"dashcentral-proposal-116\" (without quotes or spaces!)\nPress the button \"Sign\"\n\nYou have now successfully claimed your proposal!  \n\nNext step is to edit your proposal.  Include a title and copy and paste your proposal over from your pre-proposal submission. \n\n*Note: Write that this is a cross post from Dash Forum and link to your pre-proposal. * \n\n*Note: Copy the manual vote command for masternodes from Dash Central and paste it at the bottom of your proposal.*\n\n**Step 6: Lobby Masternodes and Respond to Feedback**\n\nNow all thats left to do is lobby your heart out.  Respond to questions that may rise on Dash Central.  Don\u2019t forget to check back on your pre-proposal submission in the Dash Forums. \n\nHere are three places you can go to stir up some support for your newly submitted proposal:\n\nSlack invitation link: [http://dashchat.co](http://dashchat.co)\nSubreddit: [http://reddit.com/r/dashpay](http://reddit.com/r/dashpay)\nForum: [http://dash.org/forum](http://dash.org/forum)\n\nI hope you\u2019ll follow my proposal, see how it\u2019s doing and check back with us in our third installment of The Future of Business: Contracting Directly with the Dash Protocol.\n\nFollow my proposal here: [https://www.dashcentral.org/p/Dash-to-Adoption](https://www.dashcentral.org/p/Dash-to-Adoption)\n\nIn Part 3, we will share the exciting conclusion of whether or not my proposal was successful or not.  We will also share more tips we have picked up after submitting two proposals to the Dash Network. \n\nPeace and love!\n\nJohn Bush",

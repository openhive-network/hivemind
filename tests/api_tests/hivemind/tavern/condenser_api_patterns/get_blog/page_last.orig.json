      "body": "Service blames password reuse for attacks used to drain financial accounts.\n\nhttp://s33.postimg.org/y2u6tx2b3/teamviewer_login_640x360.jpg\n\nFor more than a month, users of the remote login service TeamViewer have taken to Internet forums to report their computers have been ransacked by attackers who somehow gained access to their accounts. In many of the cases, the online burglars reportedly drained PayPal or bank accounts. No one outside of TeamViewer knows precisely how many accounts have been hacked, but there's no denying the breaches are widespread.\n\nOver the past three days, both Reddit and Twitter have exploded with such reports, often with the unsupported claim that the intrusions are the result of a hack on TeamViewer's network. Late on Friday afternoon, an IBM security researcher became the latest to report a TeamViewer account takeover.\n\n\"In the middle of my gaming session, I lose control of my mouse and the TeamViewer window pops up in the bottom right corner of my screen,\" wrote Nick Bradley, a practice leader inside IBM's Threat Research Group. \"As soon as I realize what is happening, I kill the application. Then it dawns on me: I have other machines running TeamViewer!\" \n\nhttp://arstechnica.com/security/2016/06/teamviewer-users-are-being-hacked-in-bulk-and-we-still-dont-know-how/",

      "body": "Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, announced today that it has begun mass producing the industry\u2019s first NVMe* PCIe solid state drive (SSD) in a single ball grid array (BGA) package, for use in next-generation PCs and ultra-slim notebook PCs. The new BGA NVMe SSD, named PM971-NVMe, features an extremely compact package that contains all essential SSD components including NAND flash memory, DRAM and controller while delivering outstanding performance.\n\n \n\n\u201cSamsung\u2019s new BGA NVMe SSD triples the performance of a typical SATA SSD, in the smallest form factor available, with storage capacity reaching up to 512GB,\u201d said Jung-bae Lee, senior vice president, Memory Product Planning & Application Engineering Team, Samsung Electronics. \u201cThe introduction of this small-scale SSD will help global PC companies to make timely launches of slimmer, more stylish computing devices, while offering consumers a more satisfactory computing environment.\u201d\n\n \n\nConfiguring the PM971-NVMe SSD in a single BGA package was enabled by combining 16 of Samsung\u2019s 48-layer 256-gigabit (Gb) V-NAND flash chips, one 20-nanometer 4Gb LPDDR4 mobile DRAM chip and a high-performance Samsung controller. The new SSD is 20mm x 16mm x 1.5mm and weighs only about one gram (an American dime by comparison weighs 2.3 grams). The single-package SSD\u2019s volume is approximately a hundredth of a 2.5\u201d SSD or HDD, and its surface area is about a fifth of an M.2 SSD, allowing much more design flexibility for computing device manufacturers.\n\n \n\nIn addition, the PM971-NVMe SSD delivers a level of performance that easily surpasses the speed limit of a SATA 6Gb/s interface. It enables sequential read and write speeds of up to 1,500MB/s (megabytes per second) and 900MB/s respectively, when TurboWrite** technology is used. The performance figures can be directly compared to transferring a 5GB-equivalent, Full-HD movie in about 3 seconds or downloading it in about 6 seconds. It also boasts random read and write IOPS (input output operations per second) of up to 190K and 150K respectively, to easily handle high-speed operations. A hard drive, by contrast, will only process up to 120 IOPS in random reads, making the new Samsung SSD more than 1500 times faster than an HDD in this regard.\n\n \n\nThe PM971-NVMe SSD line-up will be available in 512GB, 256GB and 128GB storage options. Samsung will start providing the new SSDs to its customers this month worldwide.\n\n \n\nAs a leading SSD provider, Samsung has a history of introducing advanced SSDs ahead of the industry. In June 2013, Samsung introduced XP941 SSD in M.2 (mini PCI-Express 2.0) form factor (80mm x 22mm), which was also the industry\u2019s first PCIe SSD for PCs. Now, Samsung plans to rapidly expand its market base in the next-generation premium notebook PC sector with the new high-performance, BGA package, NVMe SSD. Later this year, Samsung plans to introduce more high-capacity and ultra-fast NVMe SSDs to meet increasing customer needs for improved performance and greater density.\n\n \n\n* Often shortened as NVMe, NVM Express (Non-Volatile Memory Express) is an optimized, high performance, scalable host controller interface with a streamlined register interface and command set designed for enterprise, datacenter and client systems that use non-volatile memory storage. For more information, please visit www.nvmexpress.org\n\n \n\n** TurboWrite is a Samsung proprietary technology that temporarily uses certain portions of an SSD as a write buffer. TurboWrite delivers better PC experiences as users can enjoy much faster sequential write speeds. \n\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/da66f119fb.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/da694dd88f.jpg",

      "body": "The new Core i7 Extreme Edition is only for the hardcore.\n\nNow that the megahertz race has slowed down in the desktop processor world, the new race is all about more and more cores. To that end, Intel just announced its first 10-core desktop CPU, the Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition, today at Computex. (It's had 10-core Xeon CPUs for servers since 2011.) The new processor will run at 3GHz (with boost speeds up to 3.5GHz), pack in 25MB of cache and feature Intel's new Turbo Boost 3.0 technology. Just but be prepared to pay through the nose for the privilege of owning it, as the 10-core i7 Extreme Edition will run you $1,723.\n\nhttp://s33.postimg.org/edupk6rr3/Intel_Core_i7_extreme.jpg\n\nhttp://s33.postimg.org/kk17o1rzv/url_http_www_blogcdn_com_slideshows_images_sli.jpg?noCache=1464699344\n\nhttp://s33.postimg.org/bpsuqq9dr/Screen_Shot_2016_05_31_at_12_32_02_PM_1.png\n\nhttp://s33.postimg.org/kt4rdu8zj/Screen_Shot_2016_05_31_at_12_32_27_PM.jpg\nSo what does such an expensive processor get you? Intel claims it's twice as fast as the quad-core i7 6700K when it comes to 3D rendering, and 35 percent faster than the last-gen Core i7-5960X. When it comes to editing 4K video, it's 65 percent faster than that same quad-core chip and 25 percent faster than the previous i7. On the gaming front, it's 25 percent faster than the 5960X when it comes to gaming in 4K while encoding and broadcasting a 1080p Twitch stream. Basically, if you're dealing with massive amounts of content on a daily basis, it could be the ideal CPU for you.\n\nThe new Extreme Edition of i7 processors will also be available in an 8-core version (the i7-6900K for $1,089) and 6-core variants (the i7-6850K for $617 and the i7-6800K for $434). Naturally, they're completely unlocked, so you can overclock them to your heart's content. All of the new chips also support DDR4-2400 RAM, a slight bump in speeds from the previous-gen processors.\n\nIf your head is spinning at the cost of these chips, then they're probably not for you. But for demanding users, it puts Intel a step ahead of AMD, whose current high-end processor tops out at eight cores (though it's notably cheaper than any of Intel's chips). If you're in the market for a new CPU and still want a decent amount of power, Intel still has its \"Performance Unlocked\" line of i7 CPUs around, the 6600K ($242) and 6700K ($339).",

      "body": "After years of debate, researchers finally determined that persistent depression causes brain damage, and not the other way around.  Neurologists previously had hypothesized that brain damage was a predisposing factor for chronic depression, but a new study published in Molecular Psychiatry sheds a different light.\n\nThe study, which consisted of 9,000 individual samples, collected from the ENIGMA group, succeeded in definitively proving a causal relationship between persistent depression and brain damage.  Magentic resonance images (MRIs) showed evidence of hippocampus shrinkage in 1,728 patients diagnosed with chronic depression compared to the 7,199 healthy individuals partaking in the study.\n\nSpecifically, the study found that those patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder, \u201cshowed robust reductions in hippocampal volume (1.24%) in MDD patients compared with healthy controls.\u201d  You can read the full study here.\n\nWhat is the hippocampus?\n\nThe hippocampus is a small area of the brain that is located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain.  It is comprised of two halves, one which resides on each hemisphere of the brain.  It is generally agreed that the main functionality of the hippocampus encompasses the creation of new memories, the formation of long term memory, and spatial navigation.\n\nInside the hippocampus resides the amygdala.  The amygdala is a part of the brain which has previously been linked with depression.  Studies in the past have suggested a direct relationship between a shrinkage in the hippocampus and depression, but the sample size of previous studies hasn\u2019t been large enough to yield definitive results.\nThe hippocampus and depression\n\nResearchers have found that in addition to its importance in forming and maintaining memories, the hippocampus is also pivotal in controlling emotions.  Professor Ian Hickie, a co-author of the study and a renowned mental health campaigner, explains the hippocampus\u2019 relationship to depression, \u201cYour whole sense of self depends on continuously understanding who you are in the world \u2013 your state of memory is not about just knowing how to do Sudoku or remembering your password \u2013 it\u2019s the whole concept we hold of ourselves\u201d\n\nProfessor Hickie further elaborates on the relationship between a shrinkage in the hippocampus and changes in behavior observed in animals from the past, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in a lot of other animal experiments that when you shrink the hippocampus, you don\u2019t just change memory, you change all sorts of other behaviors associated with that \u2013 so shrinkage is associated with a loss of function.\u201d\n\nThose who suffer from depression usually have low self esteem and lack confidence in managing their daily lives.  It is common for those suffering from depression to also have a deflated ego, which simply refers to an individual\u2019s sense of self.  This could potentially affect how one forms memories, and how they view themselves in the past and thus project themselves in the future.\n\nWhat is depression?\n\nDepression is a seemingly hopeless state of mind where one takes extremely pessimistic thought patterns as reality. The key word is \u201cseemingly.\u201d Someone who is depressed generally has a deflated sense of self and a faulty perception of the world around them and how they view themselves in it.\nI believe that the state of depression manifests through repetitively regretting your past and fearing the future. It is not a singular conscious choice. I believe that it is a consequence of repetitive thought patterns that results in a negative outlook on life and one\u2019s self in it. A negative outlook and thought cycle only leads to more negative thoughts without some form of intervention. Sort of how like an avalanche only goes faster and gets bigger when careening down a snow-covered mountain.\n\nThese statistics concerning hippocampus reduction are intriguing as one could argue that the reduction in the hippocampus parallels this change in thought pattern. Couldn\u2019t it be harder for someone with even the slightest reduction to step out of this negative thought cycle without the full capacity of their brain?\n\nChange Your Outlook\n\nFrom my experience, my journey overcoming this condition started when I accepted what my misguided thoughts were telling me for what they were\u2013 thoughts. I found for much of my life that I tried to escape this state of mind which in a sense gave validity to it.\nOne simple, but effective tool in breaking free from depression is to get in touch with the present moment. Meditation and yoga has been essential in my daily life.\nSurrounding yourself with positive individuals is also extremely beneficial in overcoming depression. Sometimes when someone is depressed they simply cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel or find any hope in their life. That doesn\u2019t mean that those around them can\u2019t show them it\u2019s there though!\nDepression in the United States\n\nDepression is not something that should be taken lightly.  From 1999 to 2010 the suicide rate in the United States amongst Americans between the ages of 35 and 64 has increased over 25%.  Additionally, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that report that spanned from 2007 through 2010 found that almost eight percent of individuals 12 or older suffer from depression.\n\nIn the past, depression has often been thought of as a lifestyle that people are just too weak to climb out of.  Other people might incorrectly assert that depression is a sign of mental weakness.\n\nThis could not be further from the truth.\n\nWhether depression is a disorder or disease doesn\u2019t matter.  The fact remains that depression is a debilitating condition that drastically affects the lives of millions of people all over the world.  Depression is not just sadness, nor is it is symptom of weakness.  It isn\u2019t discriminatory against race, gender or ethnicity.\n\nMost importantly, depression is not a choice.\n\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/cf455462c1.png",

With Black (along with co-writers Anthony Bagarozzi and Chuck Mondry) bringing this thing to life, I'm going to take The Rock at his word on that, and can't wait to see what they do with it. I would also like to point out that The Rock's throw pillow game is on point.\n\nPresumably, Doc Savage will go in front of cameras once Black's done with The Predator. Start getting excited.\n\nhttp://www.blastr.com/sites/blastr/files/Doc-Savage-comic.jpg",

      "body": "On May 12, Tumblr revealed that it had just found out about a 2013 data breach affecting \u201ca set\u201d of users\u2019 email addresses and passwords, but the company refused to reveal how many users were affected.\n\nAs it turns out, that number is 65 million, according to an independent analysis of the data.\n\nTroy Hunt, a security researcher who maintains the data breach awareness portal Have I Been Pwned, recently obtained a copy of the stolen data set.\n\nHunt told Motherboard that the data contained 65,469,298 unique emails and passwords. (Tumblr did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the figure).\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/c55fd2ad64.png\n\nThe passwords, however, were not in plaintext, but were \u201chashed,\u201d a process that turns the actual password into a different string of digits. The company also added a series of random bytes at the end of the passwords before hashing them, or \u201csalted\u201d them, as Tumblr said when it disclosed the breach. The company, however, didn\u2019t say exactly what algorithm it used to hash the passwords.\n\nSince Tumblr\u2019s announcement, the hacked data appears to have been circulating within the internet underground. A hacker known as Peace, who also claims to have the data and was selling it on the darknet marketplace The Real Deal, said Tumblr used SHA1 to hash the passwords. Given that it also used salt, they are very hard for hackers to crack.\n\nThat\u2019s why, Peace told me, the data was essentially just a list of emails, and he was only able to sell it for $150.\n\nIn any case, considering the age of the breach and the bad practices that were used at the time across websites, it\u2019s fair to assume half of the passwords could be cracked, according to Hunt.\n\nThis data breach is now listed on Have I Been Pwned as the third largest ever, after the hack of 164 million LinkedIn accounts and the breach of 152 million Adobe accounts. You can check there to find out if you were a victim, though you should\u2019ve been notified by Tumblr when the company forced users to reset passwords after announcing the breach.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this incident is that it\u2019s come along with other massive data breaches that were just recently disclosed, but date back a few years.\n\n\u201cThis data is lying dormant (or at least out of public sight) for long periods of time,\u201d Hunt wrote in a blog post on Monday.\n\nSince Tumblr\u2019s data was discovered, years-old breaches at LinkedIn and MySpace have also emerged in the last couple of weeks. Whether there will be more, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. But as we\u2019re slowly learning, everyone gets hacked, though sometimes we don\u2019t find out for years.\n\n\u201cIf this indeed is a trend, where does it end? What more is in store that we haven't already seen?\" Hunt wrote. \"And for that matter, even if these events don't all correlate to the same source and we're merely looking at coincidental timing of releases, how many more are there in the 'mega' [breach] category that are simply sitting there in the clutches of various unknown parties?\u201c",

According to The Guardian, an anonymous translator, who prefers to be identified only by \ud83d\ude0e, reworked the King James Version of the bible using unicode emoji, as well as common internet abbreviations and slang. The bible, appropriately titled Scripture 4 Millenials, took six months to complete, and was translated with a program created by Mx. \ud83d\ude0e that matched up 80 distinct emoji with 200 words.

      "body": "Pension fund for academics funded by Cancer Research UK invested \u00a3211m in British American Tobacco last year\n\nScientists funded by Cancer Research UK who spend their lives hunting for cures for the disease are among thousands of academics whose pensions are invested in the tobacco industry, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nThe latest annual report for the university staff\u2019s pension fund shows it had \u00a3211m invested in British American Tobacco in the year to 31 March 2015 \u2013 its fifth biggest listed equities holding.\n\nThe Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) \u2013 the official name for the fund for university academics and staff \u2013 was worth \u00a349bn in 2015. The BAT holding is not the only controversial investment; its biggest holding was \u00a3344m in Royal Dutch Shell.\n\nBut the tobacco investment will come as a shock to many researchers, academics and staff. One scientist, who is employed by a leading university but whose post is funded by CRUK, was horrified to learn that her money was being invested in this way.\n\n\u201cThis means that, even if only indirectly through our time and labour, CRUK money is being invested in growing and supporting the tobacco industry,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe idea that we all have our pension invested in BAT is outrageous.\n\n\u201cAll the work of this institute is done under the guidance of CRUK, and we are, quite rightly, regularly reviewed to ensure that CRUK money is being spent effectively and efficiently in the global fight against cancer. How can this possibly be in line with the fact that most of us will retire comfortably on money earned from tobacco investments?\u201d\n\nUniversities UK, which represents vice-chancellors and principals, said USS was a responsible investor. \u201cUSS, as part of its investment duties, takes into account wider social, ethical, and environmental and governance issues, so long as that ensures that the assets of the scheme are invested in the best financial interests of members and their beneficiaries,\u201d said a spokesperson.\n\n\u201cUSS is also a responsible and engaged investor. They have, for example, undertaken engagement with tobacco companies on marketing approaches and regulations around e-cigarettes.\u201d\n\nBut public health campaigners say it is not possible to reform the tobacco industry. In March, the European Public Health Association called on investors to dump their holdings. \u201cFor decades, it has actively sought to mislead the world about the harms caused by its products. It has corrupted public officials, been complicit in illicit activities such as smuggling, and has undermined legislation to protect the health of the public,\u201d said the association in a statement.\n\nIt praised the campaigning organisation Tobacco Free Portfolios in Australia, which had successfully argued for pension funds to disinvest in tobacco. Prof Martin McKee, the president of the EUPHA, said it was calling on European institutional investors such as USS to follow suit.\n\n\u201cGiven the hard work of so many of its members to eliminate the scourge of tobacco-related death and misery, it is simply unacceptable that USS should continue to invest in this discredited industry,\u201d he said.\n\nCRUK, some of whose money indirectly ends up in BAT, said the university pension arrangements were not under its control. It is now supporting Tobacco Free Portfolios in the UK.\n\nGeorge Butterworth, CRUK\u2019s tobacco policy manager, said: \u201cThe tobacco industry\u2019s deadly products are responsible for one in four cancer deaths. Many people would be shocked to learn that their pensions are invested in tobacco company shares \u2013 especially those striving to develop cures for diseases caused by this lethal industry. Cancer Research UK\u2019s own pension funds are tobacco-free, but many of our researchers are based at institutions where that is not the case.\n\n\u201cTo help make it easier for organisations\u2019 pension schemes to opt out of tobacco shares, we\u2019re now funding the UK arm of Tobacco Free Portfolios to encourage investment funds to divest from tobacco stocks. AXA\u2019s move earlier this week to withdraw billions in investment from the tobacco industry shows what can be done.\u201d\n\nUSS said in a statement that it was \u201can active and responsible shareowner, an approach which USS\u2019s trustee believes will protect and enhance the long-term value of the fund. In order to ensure appropriate diversification we invest in a wide range of companies and assets.\n\n\u201cWe have a significant in-house responsible investment team and work with the companies in which we invest to improve ethical, environmental and governance standards, in the best financial interest of our members and beneficiaries. In recent times, this has included engaging with tobacco companies on marketing approaches and regulations around e-cigarettes. The trustee keeps its approach under review.\u201d\n\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/c50301b26f.jpg",

      "body": "Along with a number of other release date changes and announcements yesterday, 20th Century Fox revealed that they were moving up the date of The Predator from Iron Man 3 director Shane Black from March to February of 2018.\n\nBlack's rebootquel The Predator will not take the franchise back to revisit its glory years in the '80s. Rather, the film will be set in the current day, with Black dodging questions about whether that means Arnold Schwarzenegger could play his original character, just thirty or so years older, in the next installment of the franchise.\n\nSchwarzenegger is reportedly interested but \"still in talks\" and not yet committed.\n\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/bd1851ec7e.jpg\n\nWhen recently asked whether the new film would using real time \"since the first film,\" Black dodged the question somewhat, saying only that the movie would be set in the present day.\n\nBlack, who directed Iron Man 3 and is set to direct Doc Savage, will take on The Predator next, pushing Savage back a bit in the production queue. The writer/director actually appeared as Hawkins in the first film. Around that same time, he cut his teeth writing the Lethal Weapon movies, Monster Squad, and more. Besides Iron Man 3, Black has directed Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and The Nice Guys.\n\nThe Predator's new release date will be February 9, 2018. Its previous, March 2 date is now occupied by one of the untitled Marvel projects Fox has on the schedule, which had previously been slotted in as a January release.\n\nThe film has already had its first bit of marketing released, featuring the Iron Man 3-familiar tagline of \"you'll never see him coming.\"",

      "body": "Galaxy steals gas from neighboring galaxy, Tetsuo\n\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/b2b8c514e2.jpg\nA team of scientists answered an intergalactic riddle that has left many stumped. An international team discovered why galaxies that previously absorbed gases at a rapid rate and produced an impressive amount of stars will suddenly stop.\n\nUniversity of Tokyo's Edmond Cheung and his team used manga, the kind penned by Katsuhiro Otomo and the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) to name and observe the process in one particular galaxy dubbed Akira. The mostly-dormant Akira was siphoning gas from its nearby, companion galaxy fittingly christened Tetsuo.\n\nWhat the scientists saw is Tetsuo's gas fueling Akira's supermassive black hole winds. The winds travel as fast as 124 miles per second which heats up Akira and prevents it from forming new stars. Gas and gravity are usually enough for a galaxy to create a star, but the heat prevents the gas from clumping together first.\n\nScientists have named other natural phenomenon after the world of anime and manga. Researchers named a rare worm Eoperipatus totoro because of its resemblance to My Neighbor Totoro's catbus. Manga creators Moyoco Anno and Jiro Taniguchi both have asteroids named after them.",

But for whatever it\u2019s worth, I should like to add my praise and gratitude as a fellow director for the unearthly and brilliant contribution you have made to the world by your films (I have never been in Sweden and have therefore never had the pleasure of seeing your theatre work).\n\nYour vision of life has moved me deeply, much more deeply than I have ever been moved by any films. I believe you are the greatest film-maker at work today. Beyond that, allow me to say you are unsurpassed by anyone in the creation of mood and atmosphere, the subtlety of performance, the avoidance of the obvious, the truthfulness and completeness of characterization. To this one must also add everything else that goes into the making of a film.\n\nI believe you are blessed with wonderful actors. Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin live vividly in my memory, and there are many others in your acting company whose names escape me. I wish you and all of them the very best of luck, and I shall look forward with eagerness to each of your films.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nStanley Kubrick",

      "body": "The study authors gave a survey to 84 college students in the same class, asking each one to rate every other person in the study on a scale of zero (\"I do not know this person\") to five (\"One of my best friends\"), with three as the minimum score needed to qualify for friendship. The participants also wrote down their guesses for how each person would rate them.\n\nOverall, the researchers documented 1,353 cases of friendship, meaning instances where one person rated another as a three or higher. And in 94 percent of them, the person doing the ranking guessed that the other person would feel the same way.\n\nWhich makes sense -- you probably wouldn't call someone a friend, after all, unless you thought that definition was mutual. That's why we have terms to capture more one-sided relationships, like friend crush or hey, I don't really know her but I think she's neat. Both of which, come to think of it, might have been better descriptors of a lot of the relationships in the study. In reality, only 53 percent of the friendships -- a small, sad, oh honey number of them -- were actually reciprocal.\n\nSome caveats: The study was small, and all the subjects were undergraduates; friendships change over the course of a lifetime, and it's certainly possible that, over time, many tenuous lopsided friendships can dwindle to a more solid few. But the study authors also looked at a handful of previous surveys on friendship, ranging in size from 82 people to 3,160, and found similar results: Among those, the highest proportion of reciprocal friendships was 53 percent, and the lowest was a bummer, at 34 percent.\n\n\"These findings suggest a profound inability of people to perceive friendship reciprocity, perhaps because the possibility of non-reciprocal friendship challenges one's self-image,\" the study authors wrote. Fair enough. No one likes to think of themselves as the unwanted hanger-on, chasing a relationship that doesn't really exist and maybe never will; this blind spot, then, may be a form of emotional self-defense. Luckily, though, it's almost the weekend, so you'll have plenty of time to give things a good hard look and question everything you thought you knew.\n\nhttp://i2.wp.com/mediavelada.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Friendship.jpg?w=630",

      "body": "The singer was suffering from extreme stomach pain. \n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis was sent to an area hospital hours before a headlining slot at KROQ's annual Weenie Roast on May 14. Flea made the announcement from the stage at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre and apologized on behalf of the band telling the crowd at the 16,000-capacity venue that they were \"devastated.\" \n\nAccording to a rep for the Los Angeles radio station, Kiedis was taken from the venue in an ambulance suffering from extreme stomach pain. The exact nature of the problem is unknown at this time.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers Return to Alternative Songs Chart with 'Dark Necessities'\n\nWeezer ended up closing the show, which was held in Irvine, Calif. Red Hot Chili Peppers were due to take the stage at just after 10 p.m. local time. At 10:30p.m., KROQ tweeted that \"due to illness, the Chili Peppers were forced to cancel their set.\"\n\nOther bands on the bill included Panic! at the Disco, Empire of the Sun, Garbage, Lumineers, Fitz and the Tantrums and Miike Snow. Blink-182 also performed a surprise set.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0j7ac9N.jpg",

Katrina Rubinstein-Gilbert told the Canadian Press. \u201cSo she would have been driving on the road, and then all of a sudden just dropped and hit water.\u201d\n\nOfficials sent out a warning to all boats to avoid the area, and news of the woman\u2019s embarrassing navigation error spread quickly \u2013 police the Ministry of the Environment and officers from the Joint Rescue Coordination Center rushed to the scene.\n\nRubinstein-Gilbert said the driver was \u201ca little embarrassed,\u201d but generally in good spirits.\n\nApparently, no alcohol was involved in the incident and the driver will not be charged.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dVrJ5Yw.jpg",

      "body": "In its fight against so-called better-burger chains, McDonald's Corp. has started slinging fresh beef.\n\nThe Oak Brook, Ill.-based fast-food chain said it is cooking fresh beef -- rather than using \"flash frozen\" patties -- as a test in 14 restaurants in the Dallas area.\n\nThe company said on its website that it generally grinds fresh beef, forms patties, then freezes them quickly to retain flavor.\n\nThe fresh-beef trial in Dallas is limited to the patties on the chain's quarter-pounder burgers. Company spokeswoman Lisa McComb said it was \"premature\" to draw any conclusions from this test.\n\nOver the last few years, McDonald's has lost ground to smaller rivals such as In-N-Out and Shake Shack, which tout fresher ingredients and appeal to an increasingly health-conscious consumer base.\n\nMcDonald's has already introduced healthier options, such as breakfast bowls with egg whites, kale and turkey sausage, and an all-day breakfast menu, which the company credited with boosting first-quarter same-store sales by 5.4% compared with those a year earlier.\n\nBut remaking its image with customers won't be an overnight affair, said Kevin Burke, founder and managing director of investment banking firm Trinity Capital.\n\n\"It's going to be a long battle,\" he said. \"They're going to get it together sometime, but this is going to be a slow turnaround.\"\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Jzmesxh.jpg",

      "body": "From 20th May 2016 laws surrounding tobacco packaging will change. From this date all tobacco products manufactured for sale in the UK must comply with the new laws. There is a one year transitional period for the sell-through of old stock and from May 2017 all tobacco products on sale in the UK must comply with these regulations.\n\nUnder the new packaging and labelling regulations cigarettes and tobacco will no longer be sold in bright, glitzy packs, but in drab green packages. [To see the effects of attractive packaging see here for a short video produced by Cancer Research UK.] They will have large graphic images on the front and back of the packets to highlight the health effects of smoking and health warnings must appear at the top of all packs. The new packaging rules are contained in two sets of regulations:\n\n1. Regulations requiring cigarettes sold in the UK to be in standardised \u201cplain\u201d packaging\u201d [1]\n2. The revised Tobacco Products Directive [2]\n\nStandardised \u201cPlain\u201d Packaging\nStandardised or \u201cplain\u201d packaging is tobacco packaging that has had all the attractive features removed. In March 2015 MPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of introducing regulations to standardise the appearance of all tobacco packaging in the UK [3]. This includes:\n\n\u2022 The material, size, shape and opening mechanism of the packaging;\n\u2022 The colour of packaging and cigarettes;\n\u2022 The font, colour, size, case and alignment of text.\n\nTobacco Products Directive\nThe Tobacco Products Directive applies to all tobacco products manufactured and sold within EU member states. With regards to tobacco packaging the revised TPD will:\n\n\u2022 Require combined picture and text health warnings to cover 65% of the front and back of cigarette and roll-your-own tobacco packages. [4]\n\u2022 Require health warnings to appear at the top of the packet (as per the illustration).\n\u2022 Prohibit certain promotional and misleading descriptors on packaging of tobacco products such as \u201clite\u201d, \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d.\n\u2022 Require that cigarettes are sold in packs of a minimum of 20 sticks and Hand Rolling Tobacco in a minimum of 30 gram packets.\n\nThe Tobacco Products Directive will also:\n\n\u2022 Prohibit cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco with characterising flavours, for example, fruits, chocolate. Menthol tobacco will be prohibited from 20th May 2020.\n\u2022 Introduce EU-wide tracking and tracing to combat illicit trade of tobacco products. This will apply from 20th May 2019 for cigarettes and hand rolling tobacco and 20th May 2024 for all other tobacco products.\n\u2022 Electronic cigarettes - the TPD also includes a number of regulations regarding electronic cigarettes. For more information see the ASH briefing: The impact of the EU Tobacco Products Directive on e-cigarette regulation in the UK\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nIhAWtR.jpg",

F. deeply regrets the terrible attack in Iraq which today saw 16 members of a Real Madrid supporters club lose their lives and which has also left over 20 injured.\n\n\"The club expresses its great sadness and offers its regards and condolences to the families and friends of the victims.\n\n\"Real Madrid extends all of its solidarity to the people of Iraq, who suffer the excessive injustices of extreme violence.\n\n\"The Real Madrid players will tomorrow wear symbolic black armbands as a sign of their mourning and respect. \n\n\"Football and sport shall always be spaces in which to come together and in which harmony and peace reign and with which no form of barbaric terrorism will be able to compete.\n\n\"Today Madridismo across the whole world cries for its supporters, who shall never be forgotten.\"\n\nLa Liga president Javier Tebas tweeted: \"Shocked by the attack against a Real Madrid supporters club in Iraq. Terrorism attacking football. We are with the victims and their families.\n\n\"Football is a target for terror. We were going to travel to Iraq this month, but it was postponed for security reasons. We will return to support the Iraqi people.\"\n\nIn a video shot this afternoon, blood leads out on to the street from the building where a body is being carried into an emergency truck by men dressed in police and army uniforms.\n\nDozens of other people have flooded the scene and are walking through the shattered glass and blood with a sense of shock.\n\nThe remnants of of a blaze on at least one of the sofas can be seen which is littered with bottles of water.\n\nThe fan group, which has 4191 members, meet for coffee and to watch old Real Madrid games when there isn't live football on.\n\nThe video also shows the switched off TVs hung among portraits of Real Madrid heroes like Ronaldo on the wall.\n\nPresident of the supporters club Ziad Subhan said: \"A group of Islamic terrorists, from ISIS, came into the caf\u00e9, armed with AK-47s, shooting at random at everyone who was inside\".\n\nAsked about the motives for the attack, AS reports the president said: \"They don't like football, they think it's anti-Muslim.\n\n\"They just carry out attacks like this. This is a terrible tragedy\".\n\nThe attackers fled and hours later one of them set off his explosive vest at a nearby vegetable market after police cornered him in a disused building.\n\nA Real Madrid club statement said: \"Real Madrid profoundly laments the terrible attack today in Iraq which has ended the life of 16 members of a Madrid fan club and that injured more than 20.\n\n\u201cThe club expresses its total sadness and offers its thoughts and condolences to the families and friends of the victims.\n\n\u201cReal Madrid extends its solidarity to the people of Iraq, that suffers the injustice of extremist violence.\n\n\u201cThe Real Madrid players will wear a symbolic black armband as a sign of mourning and respect, because football and sports will always be places of meeting, harmony and peace which no savage terrorism will overcome.\n\n\u201cMadrid fans around the world weep today for its fans, who will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\nThe official Twitter account for La Liga posted on Twitter that it was \"thinking of the victims and families\".\n\nSupporters clubs in the Middle East said they were united in grief throughout the 'commonwealth of Real Madrid fans'.\n\nThey claimed that 'the very youngest innocent members of the association' were targeted in the attack in Iraq, describing them as martyrs - and that they were praying 'for the wounded to heal'.\n\nAn association of Chelsea fans in Iraq also condemned the act of terrorism - and fans of the club worldwide reacted with horror and shock at the news on social media.\n\nOne fan Ryan (@ryantran55) posted: \"No matter how different we may be, we all share one common love. My thoughts go out to the Real Madrid fan club attack victims in Iraq.\"\n\nAnother football fan Kilian Hanratty (@KilianHanratty) said: \"Football has brought millions together for the better - Isis \u2018don\u2019t like football\u2026 they think it\u2019s anti-Muslim.\"\n\nAnd fan Richie Bryant (@roxrichie) posted: \"Isis kills real madrid fans this morning at a gathering club in Iraq. .now isis isn't just religious n political but also social.ridiculous!\" (sic)\n\nThe attack was said be in honour of Abdel Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli, the ISIS second-in-command who was killed in a coalition strike in March.\n\nEarlier this week, three separate car bombings in Baghdad killed at least 93 people and wounded 165.\n\nThe Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for all three bombings.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uDHhaJ5.jpg",

But, even then, we weren't granted our first visit with him until after 11 months of imprisonment.\n\n'When we realized his death sentence was to be carried out, Reza's mother and I somehow managed to drive 840 kilometres to Ghezel Hesar Prison to see him for the last time. \n\n'But, once we arrived, the authorities did not allow us to visit him. Instead, they hurled insults at us.'  \n\nAccording to Geravand, the prosecutor in her husband's case file had assured the family he would be exonerated.\n\nBut, in the trial lasting only two minutes, Judge Tayerani sentenced him to death.\n\nThe judge had encouraged him to plead guilty but Hosseini replied saying: 'Why should I plead guilty if I am innocent?'\n\nTo that the judge responded: 'If you are innocent, then you will go to heaven after you are hanged.' \n\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tRJFycJ.jpg",

      "body": "Investigators for the 9/11 commission would later describe the scene in Saudi Arabia as chilling.\n\nThey took seats in front of a former Saudi diplomat who, many on the commission\u2019s staff believed, had been a ringleader of a Saudi government spy network inside the US that gave support to at least two of the 9/11 hijackers in California in the year before the 2001 attacks.\nSaudi officials were 'supporting' 9/11 hijackers, commission member says\nRead more\n\nAt first, the witness, 32-year-old Fahad al-Thumairy, dressed in traditional white robes and headdress, answered the questions calmly, his hands folded in front of him. But when the interrogation became confrontational, he began to squirm, literally, pushing himself back and forth in the chair, folding and unfolding his arms, as he was pressed about his ties to two Saudi hijackers who had lived in southern California before 9/11.\n\nEven as he continued to deny any link to terrorists, Thumairy became angry and began to sputter when confronted with evidence of his 21 phone calls with another Saudi in the hijackers\u2019 support network \u2013 a man Thumairy had once claimed to be a stranger. \u201cIt was so clear Thumairy was lying,\u201d a commission staffer said later. \u201cIt was also so clear he was dangerous.\u201d\n\nAn interrogation report prepared after the questioning of the Saudi diplomat in February 2004 is among the most tantalizing of a sheaf of newly declassified documents from the files of the staff of the 9/11 commission. The files, which were quietly released by the National Archives over the last 18 months and have drawn little public scrutiny until now, offer a detailed chronology of how the commission\u2019s staff investigated allegations of Saudi government involvement in 9/11, including how the panel\u2019s investigators flew to Saudi Arabia to go face-to-face with some of the Saudis believed to have been part of the hijackers\u2019 support network on American soil.\n\nThe newly declassified documents may also help resolve the lingering mystery about what is hidden in a long-classified congressional report about ties between Saudi Arabia and the 9/11 attacks.\n\nA former commission staff member said in an interview last week that the material in the newly released files largely duplicates information from \u201cthe 28 pages\u201d, as they are commonly known in Washington, and then goes well beyond it.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity for fear of angering his former colleagues, he said he was annoyed that so much attention has been focused on \u201cthe 28 pages\u201d when, in fact, the commission had full access to the congressional report and used it as a roadmap to gather new evidence and witness accounts that demonstrated sinister connections between low-level Saudi government officials and a terrorist support network in southern California.\n\n\u201cWe had lots of new material,\u201d the former staffer said. Another, earlier memo from the commission\u2019s files, unearthed last month by the website 28pages.org, which is pressing for release of the congressional report, lists the names of dozens of Saudis and others who had come under suspicion for possible involvement with the hijackers, including at least two Saudi naval officers. The memo, dated June 2003, noted the concern of the staff that earlier US investigations of the Saudi ties to terrorism had been hindered by \u201cpolitical, economic or other considerations\u201d.\n\nBarack Obama has said he is nearing a decision on whether to declassify the 28 pages, a move that has led to the first serious public split among the 9/11 commissioners since they issued a final report in 2004. The commission\u2019s former chairman and vice chairman have urged caution in releasing the congressional report, suggesting it could do damage to US-Saudi relations and smear innocent people, while several of the other commissions have called for the 28 pages to be made public, saying the report could reveal leads about the Saudis that still need to be pursued.\n\nEarlier this week, a Republican commissioner, former navy secretary John F Lehman, said there was clear evidence that Saudi government employees were part of a support network for the 9/11 hijackers \u2013 an allegation, congressional officials have confirmed, that is addressed in detail in the 28 pages.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Lehman said that while he had not meant to his comments to suggest any deep disagreements among the 10 commissioners about their investigation, he stood by his view \u2013 directly contradicting the commission\u2019s chairman and vice-chairman \u2013 that \u201cthere was an awful lot of participation by Saudi individuals in supporting the hijackers, and some of those people worked in the Saudi government\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 9/11 investigation was terminated before all the relevant leads were able to be investigated,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cI believe these leads should be vigorously pursued. I further believe that the relevant 28 pages from the congressional report should be released, redacting only the names of individuals and certain leads that have been proven false.\u201d\nBarack Obama meets with Saudi King Salman. The US president has said he is nearing a decision on whether to declassify the 28 pages.\n\nFor some of the families of 9/11 victims and others who have been harshly critical of the investigation conducted by the 9/11 commission, the newly declassified paperwork from the commission\u2019s files and the renewed debate over the 28 pages are likely to raise the question of why the blue-ribbon, 10-member panel effectively overruled the recommendations of some its staff and produced a final report that was widely seen as an exoneration of Saudi Arabia, home to 15 of the 19 hijackers and the source of much of al-Qaida\u2019s funding before 9/11.\nAdvertisement\n\nThe files show that the commission\u2019s investigators, which included veterans of the FBI, justice department, CIA and state department, confronted the Saudi witnesses in 2003 and 2004 with evidence and witness accounts that appeared to confirm their involvement with a network of other Saudi expatriates in southern California who provided shelter, food and other support to two of the 9/11 hijackers \u2013 Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar \u2013 in the year before the attacks. The two hijackers, both Saudis, were aboard American Airlines flight 77 when it crashed into the Pentagon.\n\nAccording to the newly declassified interrogation reports, another key Saudi witness who appeared before the commission, Osama Basnan, a man described as \u201cthe informal mayor\u201d of the Islamic community in San Diego before 9/11, was repeatedly caught in lies when asked about his relationship to Saudis in the support network. Basnan, who returned home to Saudi Arabia after coming under investigation after 9/11, had an \u201cutter lack of credibility on virtually every material subject\u201d in denying any role in a terrorist support network, the report said.\n\nBasnan came under scrutiny, in part, because of tens of thousands of dollars in cashiers\u2019 checks that his ailing wife received before 9/11 from a charitable fund controlled by the wife of the Saudi ambassador to Washington, Princess Haifa al-Faisal. Congressional investigators determined that much of that money, which totaled as much as $70,000, had been turned over to the family of another Saudi man in San Diego, Omar al-Bayoumi, who was at the center of efforts to assist the two hijackers, including moving them from Los Angeles to San Diego and helping them find an apartment and enter flight school. Telephone records would show that Bayoumi had been in close contact throughout the period with Thumairy, the Saudi diplomat in Los Angeles who was eventually detained and deported from the US on terrorism charges.\n\n\nAlthough the 9/11 commission\u2019s report drew no final conclusion about the roles of Basnan and Bayoumi, former US senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who led the joint House-Senate intelligence committee that wrote the 28 pages, has said repeatedly over the years that he is convinced that both men were low-level Saudi government intelligence officers and that money from the embassy charity fund may well have ended up with the two hijackers. Graham has said he believes both Basnan and Bayoumi were Saudi government \u201cspies\u201d who had been dispatched to southern California to keep watch on dissidents in the area\u2019s relatively large community of Saudi expatriates.\n\nThe newly declassified files from the commission show that questions about Princess Haifa, her charity fund and the two hijackers were considered so serious that they were raised directly in an October 2003 meeting in Saudi Arabia between the commission\u2019s investigators and the then-deputy Saudi foreign minister Nizar Madani. \u201cNizar expressed disbelief about the allegations regarding Princess Haifa, noting it was preposterous that she was involved in terrorism,\u201d according to the commission\u2019s summary of the meeting. The Saudi government has insisted that the princess, a daughter of the late King Faisal, had no reason to believe that the money would be used for anything other than to pay medical bills for Basnan\u2019s wife, who suffered from thyroid problems, and to cover the family\u2019s household expenses.\n\nThe report prepared after the interrogation of Bayoumi, who was paid a salary in San Diego by a Saudi aviation contractor but was unable to prove that he actually did any work for the company, documents his tense confrontation with the commission\u2019s investigators during their visit to Saudi Arabia in October 2003, especially when he was presented with evidence of the \u201cdamning appearance of the circumstances surrounding\u201d his ties to the two hijackers.\n\nBayoumi said he was innocent of any connection to terrorism and said \u201cthe description of him as a \u2018Saudi spy\u2019 hurt him very much\u201d, the newly-released report said. He said it was coincidence that led him to an Arab-food restaurant in Los Angeles where he first met the two hijackers, who spoke almost no English, in January 2000. According to the report, \u201che professed his feelings for the victims of the 9/11 attacks, citing his daughter\u2019s US citizenship and the many friends he has in the US\u201d.\n\nThe commission\u2019s newly declassified files suggest that the commission staff considered the questioning of Thumairy to be the most important of the interrogations conducted in Saudi Arabia, since the young Saudi was not only an accredited diplomat and an imam of a large Saudi government-built mosque in southern California. He had also been posted to the US at the request of the Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs, long considered by American intelligence agencies to be supportive of Islamic extremist groups outside Saudi Arabia. In Los Angeles, he was known among fellow Saudis to hold fundamentalist views on Islam.\n\nAt the first of two sessions \u201cThumairy initially sat at the table with his hands folded in front of him\u201d, the interrogation report said. \u201cOver the course of the interview, his posture changed noticeably when the questions became more confrontational. During such instances, al-Thumairy would cross his arms, sit back in his chair and rely more heavily on the interpreter.\u201d\n\nThe questions became especially difficult for Thumairy as he kept insisting that he did not know many of the others Saudis in southern California who had been linked to the two hijackers, including Bayoumi, despite phone logs and other records showing he had been in contact with Bayoumi dozens of times. He was presented with a statement from a witness, another Saudi cleric in Los Angeles, who recalled often seeing Thumairy and Bayoumi meeting at the southern California mosque. Presented with the evidence, Thumairy became agitated. \u201cThumairy initially said he may have been mistaken for somebody else,\u201d the interrogation report said. \u201cHe then said there are some people who may say things that are false out of mere spite or jealousy.\u201d\n\nPressed on whether he had led conversations about \u201cjihad\u201d at the mosque among Saudi worshippers, Thumairy confirmed there were discussions \u201cbut that it was only about \u2018good\u2019 jihad, not \u2018bad\u2019 jihad. He said this discussion was not only necessary, but that it was his responsibility to teach the Islamic community the difference between good and bad jihad, especially after 9/11\u201d.\n\n    Philip Shenon is the author of The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ySQEeIM.jpg",

      "body": "We\u2019re big fans of Netflix over here at Cordcutting.com \u2013 and according to some recent data, we\u2019re not the only ones. In fact, our calculations show that subscribers spend much more time binge-watching Netflix than they do hanging out with their friends!\n\nAccording our calculations, the average Netflix subscriber watches 1 hour and 40 minutes of Netflix each day (you can check out the math in our piece on Netflix\u2019s commercials \u2013 essentially, we just took the total number of Netflix streaming hours per day as reported by CEO Reed Hastings and divided it by the number of Netflix subscribers worldwide).\n\nOn its own, that statistic isn\u2019t so bad \u2013 especially when you think of all of the time those Netflix users are saving by skipping commercials. But maybe we should all get out a bit more often, because when we compare the results of our calculations with data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we see that we are spending a lot more time with Netflix than with their own friends.\n\nHow much more? Well, we already established that the average Netflix subscriber\u2019s day includes 100 minutes of Netflix. According the the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 American Time Use Survey, the average American spends just 38 minutes \u201csocializing and communicating\u201d each day. That means that Netflix subscribers spend more than twice as much time binge-watching Netflix as they do hanging around with friends!\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019re comparing data from two different sources here \u2013 the BLS data samples Americans (with no regard to whether or not they subscribe to Netflix), and our data samples Netflix subscribers worldwide. However, it\u2019s unlikely that non-subscribers are significantly less social than subscribers, so we can expect that the number of minutes each group spends \u201csocializing and communicating\u201d should be about the same. And since we Americans enjoy Netflix\u2019s largest catalog (for now, at least) and are not known for our active lifestyles, its unlikely that including international subscribers heightened the contrast \u2013 if anything, we\u2019d expect that isolating American subscriber data would make the gap even more dramatic. Sorry, streamers, but sampling issues can\u2019t explain away our lack of social lives.\n\nAs poorly as friends rank in our daily schedules, they still outperform \u201creading,\u201d \u201crelaxing and thinking,\u201d and \u201cparticipating in sports, exercise, recreation.\u201d The average American spends just 17 minutes a day exercising, which means that we Netflix subscribers spend about six times longer watching Netflix each day than we do exercising. No wonder we don\u2019t want our friends to see us!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BS2zSjF.png",

      "body": "When you cast a major superhero, you have to make sure that you make the right choice, or else face the wrath of the fans. Marvel did wonderfully when they cast Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, and although he was a bit taller than the comic character, Fox hit it out of the park when they cast Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. When it came time for Deadpool to be cast, nobody could have done it better than Ryan Reynolds.\n\nWe all know that Reynolds was first cast as Wade Wilson in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but he has been in love with the character long before. According to a recent Talks at Google interview, he revealed that he was first introduced to the character in 2004.\n\n    I was on a set, I was on the movie 'Blade Trinity'... It was a movie where I got to have a lot of fun. I got to do the movie with a lot of my friends... But I played a character in the movie that I guess resembles Wade Wilson and Deadpool, and a rival executive at another studio said \"I saw a little piece of 'Blade', and, you know, you're Wade Wilson, you're Deadpool\".\n\n    I didn't know it at the time. This was in 2004, I didn't know who Deadpool was, and he said \"Trust me, if they ever make a movie about Deadpool, you're the only guy that could play Deadpool.\"\n\nWell this mysterious studio executive certainly knew what he was talking about. It must be flattering to be told that you are the only one who could play such an iconic character, but just wait, it gets better as the interview goes on.\n\n    So he sent me over all these comics, and I'm not a big comic-book guy, but I really gravitated toward Deadpool. I fell in love with Deadpool. The first issue I opened up, I'm not making this up, I was on he panel. Like in the comic, it said Deadpool was saying \"I look like a cross between Ryan Reynolds and a shar-pei.\" And I was thinking, Jesus, this is f***ing destiny.\n\nDestiny it is, Ryan. He was referring to the comic panel above, which illustrates more than anything else that Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. That's why since 2004, he tried for the next eleven years to try and get Deadpool the big-screen treatment.\n\nAfter an actual Deadpool movie was in talks a couple of years ago, fans were pretty divided on the casting issue. Reynolds was naturally the front-runner, seeing as he played the character in Origins, but many fans were worried that the character's unfortunate portrayal would scar any future incarnation.\n\nI'm sure everyone remembers this guy.\nI'm sure everyone remembers this guy.\n\nThat was definitely not the case, as Reynolds's performance in the Deadpool movie was nothing short of incredible. It was everything that a Deadpool movie should be, and a large part of that is due to Reynolds's improv skill and overall love for the character. Even he thinks he was born to play the role.\n\nWhen he was asked in the same interview about his preparation for the role, he responded:\n\n    The prep for me was easy. It was basically being eased out of my mother's womb, and then being fed enough to grow into adulthood, and then beginning filming. \n\nSo for any of you that still think that Ryan Reynolds should have been re-cast as Wade Wilson, please go see the movie. You will see what we have all come to realize, and it's that nobody could play Deadpool like Ryan Reynolds.\n\nhttp://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_scale,h_600,w_1200/t_mp_quality/vxu6cttjh704ixrprj2s/this-story-proves-that-ryan-reynolds-was-born-to-play-deadpool-843474.jpg\n\nhttp://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_scale,h_891,w_980/t_mp_quality/dlypxopu49o2tq6q8ubx/this-story-proves-that-ryan-reynolds-was-born-to-play-deadpool-843478.jpg",

Ross also learns from experience, gaining speed and knowledge the more you interact with it.\n\n\u201cYou ask your questions in plain English, as you would a colleague, and ROSS then reads through the entire body of law and returns a cited answer and topical readings from legislation, case law and secondary sources to get you up-to-speed quickly,\u201d [the website says](http://www.rossintelligence.com/lawyers/). \u201cIn addition, ROSS monitors the law around the clock to notify you of new court decisions that can affect your case.\u201d\n\nRoss also minimizes the time it takes by narrowing down results from a thousand to only the most highly relevant answers, and presents the answers in a more casual, understandable language. It also keeps up-to-date with developments in the legal system, specifically those that may affect your cases.\n\n## The Legal Industry Enhanced\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Y_cqBP08yuA\n\n\nBaker & Hostetler chief information officer Bob Craig explains the rationale behind this latest hire: \u201cAt BakerHostetler, we believe that emerging technologies like cognitive computing and other forms of machine learning can help enhance the services we deliver to our clients.\u201d\n\n\u201cBakerHostetler has been using ROSS since the first days of its deployment, and we are proud to partner with a true leader in the industry as we continue to develop additional AI legal assistants,\u201d he added.",

    "body": "Dear Richard,\n\nWow. That took some serious guts to write. I commend you for your honesty and I thank you for thinking about me in the context of what you see as a solution. I believe that @donkeypong would be an excellent choice in that role.\n\nI have also been experiencing the same things you mentioned with regards to the cognitive dissonance. It suddenly dawned upon me last month that Steemit was not created by artists/writers/curators who would instinctively know what needed to be done for future artists/writers/curators. We have a very detail-oriented programmer/visionary and an ex-private equity fund manager who knows a great deal about finance and markets. Steemit is an excellent bank and I greatly appreciate the blockchain and all the technical aspects of its construction. I also feel indebted to this site because it rewarded me for my writing, in a way that no other client has ever rewarded me for. Like all things, however, now, I do feel that I am not able to speak my mind, for fear of backlash and flagging. I did not see this coming.\nI agree with your assessment that there seems to be a lack of emotional intelligence and an inability to listen, take feedback and then turn that feedback into action. This kind of thing does require a certain kind of personality and it also requires life experience and maturity.\n\nI see the primary issue as a tug of war between attempting to create a decentralized, transparent system and a centralized chain of command. By posting as individuals on Steemit and letting the community comment freely, it gives the illusion of a decentralized system. However, when an unpopular hardfork goes into effect, despite the fact that many prominent members, @donkeypong being the most visible voice, it gives rise to a pause. I don't think anyone really knows or understands why the vote count is going to be changed to 5 instead of 40. In my mind, a reduction of votes equals a sort of constriction effect, like a boa constrictor wrapping itself around my neck, which leads to a sort of rationing of energy which leads to stress, which leads to me wanting to get off Steemit in order to reduce the stress levels. And, no, I still don't understand what the restriction of votes mean. I read a bunch of posts and rebuttals, but to be honest, even I don't understand why it was changed. I doubt that many people even have the foggiest idea. Perhaps in theory it is a good idea, but to an artist, with a visually-enhanced imagination, I equate fewer votes with a scarcity mindset. An abundance mindset would mean that people would not have restrictions and would be encouraged to love the posts on steemit so much that they could vote to their heart's content. This is the cognitive dissonance that Richard is describing so well. \nWhen you have Vulcans (And I use Vulcans in a good way, as Spock is one of my favorite characters) making rules for regular people, it turns out that the regular people don't really understand the rules at all, and continue playing their own game in spite of the rules, because they were never made for them in the first place. Vulcans just need to be balanced by regular people, that is what I meant to add. \nI guess if I ran this place, I would send a huge apology to Richard. And then I would thank him for opening my eyes to the truth. Then I'd sit down, get several drinks ready and just sort of soak in everything that has gone down so far, while continuing to sip my drinks. I'd start listening to the people who are the power users and I'd really start reading everything that minnows are complaining about. I'd take several days off the regular grind, and dive into solving the issues for the users, because I'd realize that the users will either make or break my future. I'd start with reading every response from [The Steemit User Survey](https://steemit.com/steemit/@stellabelle/steemit-user-survey-results-part-1) because I would realize that the answers to the problems lie inside there. Then, I'd build my own surveys, in an attempt to collect more data on how to improve Steemit. I'd respond to the data and make changes based on what I found, not on preconceived notions of how I wanted to change it. \nI guess that is what I would do. I would not give up, but I would not continue down the same path either. I would become more like water, less like rock. I would realize that I would still be in the running to alter the course of history. That is why I'd change.",

Yes, it is supposed to be censorship free, however, that should not be used as an excuse for extreme abuse and harassment.\nSecond, we have two people here who have clearly demonstrated through their posts over time that they are reasonable, mature, and personable individuals so why the comments suggesting that this is a case of \"he said, she said\"?\nThere should not be any question about that even if all one has as evidence is the information put forward in this post.\nThird, in my opinion, this is definitely both a Steemit issue AND an incident of abuse and harassment that must be taken seriously and acted upon in a decisive and constructive manner.\nThis is not a \"problem for Dan to deal with\". It is a problem that falls squarely on the shoulders of all who are a part of the community and it is our aggregate responsibility to condemn unacceptable behavior in no uncertain terms and demonstrate the fact that abuse and harassment on the Steemit platform should and will not be tolerated.\nRegardless of how incredible the technology, innovative infrastructure, and financial potential Steemit provides, the whole project will fail miserably if the community does not take concrete and immediate steps to deal with and prevent abuse and harassment on the platform.",

    "body": "A friend and I met for lunch at a local taco shack near the city's greenbelt, where he planned to take his mountain bike out for a cruise along the trails. As it was a pleasant Autumn afternoon and there was nothing keeping me, I decided to take a walk through the beautiful sun-soaked woods myself.\n\nAfter tacos we made our way to the trail head together, at which point he asked in what direction I was headed. \n\n\"I don't know,\" was my reply. \n\nMounting his trusty carbon-fiber steed he took off and soon disappeared around a bend leaving me there alone. \n\nLooking down the trail to my left, then up the trail to my right \u2026 then back to the left again, as if awaiting some unseen force to propel me in either direction, but feeling no particular pull, I finally rested my gaze upon an opening in the trees just in front of where I stood, and so up the middle I went. \n\nStepping through the woods about forty or so feet, I came out onto a bone-dry creek bed which I then followed. Poking along haphazardly up the old creek bed for ten minutes or more, I looked up and was suddenly bewildered by what I saw. \n\nNot far off in the distance I could just begin to make out what seemed to resemble stalagmites \u2013 a group of twisted, spindling, rocky spires that reminded me of something I might have once seen in Southeastern Utah or the caverns of New Mexico. \n\nAs I drew closer it was impossible to suppress a smile. \n\nHere is what I found ....\n\n![image 1](https://s15.postimg.io/b2gnkfe63/img1.jpg)\n\n![image 2](https://s22.postimg.io/6142bastt/img2.jpg)\n\n![image 3](https://s11.postimg.io/qda6yn9oz/img3.jpg)\n\n![image 4](https://s18.postimg.io/rfx58pcg9/img4_6.jpg)\n\n![image 5](https://s13.postimg.io/b1llkt7nr/img5.jpg)\n\n![image 6](https://s22.postimg.io/o27tdn7cx/img8_9.jpg)\n\n![image 7](https://s3.postimg.io/6xel5spoj/img10_7.jpg)\n\n![image 8](https://s22.postimg.io/xfn5dopr5/img11_12.jpg)\n\nAfter some time I sat down to meditate among the stones. \n\nSitting there in the silence, I at some point found myself moved to envision in my mind's eye a sense of all humanity. This vision encompassed the many individual thoughts, feelings, attitudes and actions of mankind, including those that we tend to regard as undesirable: all of the deceitful, violent, selfish, cunning, calculating hurt and pain that we are capable of inflicting upon others as well as upon ourselves \u2013 those things that we wish to reform within ourselves but about which we often harbor some form of condemnation and contempt for in others.\n\nEventually entering into this vision of the totality of mankind was an opening up to a sense of love, understanding and acceptance for all of it, including our many so called 'detractions'.  \n\nJust as I was coming to this point, from the periphery, now drawing my attention away, was a growing awareness of one such member of humanity incarnate. Indeed, as I looked up, there was a trail runner breaking stride fifty feet or so away from where I sat on my haunches.\n\nHaving clearly run for some distance along the creek bed, he now stood hands on his knees drawing several heavy breaths, before continuing in my direction at a walk. \n\nI tracked him unflinchingly as he passed, anticipating a silent exchange of glances, if nothing else, but he did not so much as motion to look in my direction. \n\nAs he moved along, I let my eyes come to a close once more, attempting to re-calibrate with the vision. Yet, now conscious of his presence somewhere off in the near distance among the rocky spires, my focus waned. \n\nOpening my eyes again I spotted a leg through the cairns. Why him? Why now? Why had this stranger been allowed to intrude upon me at the seeming apex of my meditation? Was this some sort of malevolent ploy orchestrated by the devil himself to prevent me from attaining the enlightened state I was surely just about to reach had I not been interrupted? Damn you again, Universe, for not abetting my spiritual awakening! Though not explicit in such words, this was the essence of my mental reaction to the situation at hand.\n\nThen the following realization took hold of me: Here before me was a perfect, outward, real-world example, illustrating for me the very thing I had been trying to capture in my meditation. Whereas I had begun opening to embrace, accept, and feel compassion toward the 'negative' within my meditative mind-state, I was now all too readily rejecting and mentally discarding what I perceived to be a negative outcome unfolding for me in actual experiential reality. I was condemning rather then embracing my own experience. \n\nWith that, I again closed my eyes, intent on letting go of the idea that this runner's presence had somehow arrived as an inconvenience, and instead attempted to welcome it as a practical instantiation of the very thing I had been meditating on.\n\nWithin no time at all I was stirred again by the sound of footsteps. The same man having circled round, now walked by me again, heading back in the direction he had come, only this time he acknowledged me with a nod and a wave as he passed. I nodded back silently. As he opened up into a run back down the creek bed, I stood up and watched until he was just a trace in the distance.\n\nAfter a few minutes I started back down the creek myself, when another thought struck me, causing me to ponder the implications of what had just transpired still further. The trail runner had appeared to be around my age, roughly the same height, with a very similar build. We both had light hair with a scruffy unshaven face, and had both been shirtless. The more I considered it, our resemblance was uncanny. \n\nHad the Universe, rather than forsaking me, merely been presenting me with a mirror?\n\n*(The preceding account was first written in Autumn of 2013, shortly after it occurred.

Can't lose those few extra pounds?\n\n**Need some more excuses to add to your list?**\n\nWithout further adieu, the **ULTIMATE** list of **VALID EXCUSES**. \n\nNo. Really.\n\nI have a full time job, three kids, two dogs, and a cat.. I don't have enough time to work on my idea.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have student debt to pay off, there is **no way** I can afford to work on my business on the side.\n\nI'm **not qualified** for the job that I know I'm perfect for... Might as well not even **try.**\n\nThe last guy I asked out **rejected me.**. At least Netflix **doesn't judge.**\n\nMy parents were **both overweight**, which means I'll always struggle with my own body issues.\n\nI didn't go to a great college, so there's no way I'll be hired to work at an awesome startup.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI was born skinny, no workout plan will help me gain some muscle.\n\nI tried my last business idea and it **failed miserably..** now my parents won't even talk to me.\n\nAll my friends grew up never having to worry about money.. **they don't understand what it's like to be me.**\n\nMy family and friends are *so negative..* and there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nI'll work on my project at later this year. It will be better timing.\n\nI made a few huge mistakes early on in my career, and now I'm destined for mediocrity.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI want to learn how to draw, but art supplies are **too expensive.**\n\nI really want to learn Spanish, but learning a new language **as an adult is impossible.**\n\nI would really like to start a podcast, but **I don't know how.**\n\nI bought a course on entrepreneurship, but it was a scam so I didn't follow through.\n\nI'm an introvert, so I can't go learn how to \"network.\"\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nI don't have enough time! All the successful people I know have money to hire a virtual assistant.\n\nMy job sucks, so I'm super tired after work -- Madden is **my time to unwind.**\n\nI had a really bad childhood, **everyone is out to get me.**\n\nI have **really** bad anxiety.. I can't possibly ask for a raise.\n\nI did everything I could! I don't know why I didn't get promoted.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEveryone seems to take advantage of me. Why should I even try?\n\nI hosted an event at college on how to manage personal finances. No one showed up.\n\nMy first few jobs **were all failures**. Will I ever find the job that is right for me?\n\nI want to work on my online business, but Twitter and FB keep sending me notifications.\n\nI can't afford to eat healthy, McDonalds is on my way home.\n\nMy mum, father, brother, sister, say I should be a lawyer... I guess that means that's my destiny.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI wrote a blog post, but no one read it. I must be a terrible writer.\n\nNo one understands my situation... **I'm stuck and always will be.**\n\nI want to make money online, but everyone who does is a scammer!\n\nI've been wanting to change careers for years now, but I'm 40 and it's far too late for that.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI read a few books in highschool and hated it. No book appeals to me.\n\nI'm so afraid of coming up short! **What will my family and friends think?**\n\nI raised money for my last startup and it failed... Now investors won't return my calls.\n\nI had to settle for a job that I hate, because my wife and children are depending on me.\n\nI am **TERRIBLE** at math! I'll never be able to learn calculus.\n\nAll my friends went to an amazing school. I'm destined to be a loser.\n\nThere's so much I want to learn! But I don't have the time or money to do so.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy last girlfriend broke up with me out of the blue... I'll **never** be able to find love like that again.\n\nMy entire family loves political party x.. but I disagree with them! We'll never be able to get along.\n\nMy friend said I was wasting my talents.. **I just want to give up.**\n\nI'm in a shitty relationship, and I don't know what to do.\n\nI was a jerk to my friend, and now they won't talk to me.\n\nMy super successful coworker has always been good with people! I'll never be able to be like him.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm always shy in group situations.. no matter what I try.. I can never be good with people.\n\nMy friend has a fitbit! **I'm so jealous**! No wonder she is able to stay in such good shape.\n\nMy uncle lied to me when I was young! I can't trust anyone anymore!\n\nI don't understand FB. **My online business is doomed.**\n\nMy teacher said I would never be a good writer. I became a lawyer instead.\n\nI tried a new exercise routine for 3 days and it didn't work.\n\nEating healthy is so boring!\n----------------------------\n\nI don't **know how** to start a website!!\n\nMy significant other thinks my business idea is stupid. I guess I should stay at my job.\n\nI have **ADD..** there's no way I can ever focus long enough to succeed.\n\n.....\n.........\n.....\n.........\n\nValid? Yes.\n-----------\n\nWe've all listened to the abundance of excuses living inside our head.\n\nBut your health, happiness, and future success depends on your ability to ignore.\n\nWhat's your excuse? Good. \n\nYou're human.\n\nNow go and make things happen anyway.\n\n**P.S** Would love to hear what 'excuses' are holding you back?

    "body": "In the study of sociology and psychology, people have studied the behaviors of people. The amazing fact is that, for all of the data, studies and surveys the experts have done over the years, have done nothing to come up with solutions for people\u2019s inaccurate ways of thinking. Looking at how people behave socially today is not much different than our ancestors conducted themselves socially during their lives. \n\nThere are three topics or ways of thinking in this writing that grabbed my attention the most, my guess is that I have experienced them at past times in my life, today even in the present and as I hope to improve myself as a person, I will probably experience the same three in the future so I can only plan on how I can pass in the positives in everyday social interaction. This way, we can treat people who may look different or speak differently than us the same as we would treat our own brother. That we will be honest in our behaviors with people and not adopt lying as a lifestyle, and finally to be followers to just leadership but to also take the step to be leaders ourselves. \n\n# **We just want people around us to be alike, and assume they\u2019re bad if they aren't:**\n\n<center>https://scottwoodsmakeslists.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/blackmanwhat.jpg</center>\n\n**Image Source: [ScottWoodsMakesLists](https://scottwoodsmakeslists.wordpress.com)**\n\nI truly believe this has gone on since people were scattered into different groups and at the day humans were divided by language. Over many centuries, physical features like skin color, eye color, and hair type brought more uniqueness in the human family but also more division. Over time, those groups with those unique features formed cultures which contained, their own language, style of clothing, education, religion, foods, and traditions. \n\nYet beneath all of those differences, we were still one big family descended from the first man and woman. Sadly, there were those who see people who may look different, speak different, dress different as being inferior. Those were the ones the supposed superior group would who look down on with fear and hate of the other groups of people because they were different.\n\nThe best example of this was the slave trade. I can say that The United States was the country and its culture for the most part from the 17th through the middle part of the 19th century accepted the enslavement of black Africans because, in the eyes of the masters, they were not human with their dark skin and that they were nothing more than property. Yet the concept of one group of people enslaving another went on long before that time in history. Again, some groups of people believe other people were bad because they are different from them?!\n\n**Study Source: [ChangingMinds](http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/in-group_bias.htm)**\n\n\n# **We lie to ourselves to make our decisions feel better:**\n\n<center>http://discovermagazine.com/~/media/Images/Issues/2013/June/self-deceit.jpg</center>\n\n**Image Source: [DiscoverMagazine](http://discovermagazine.com)**\n\nI found an interesting article on a website called Livescience called \u201cWhy We Lie\u201d by Robin Lloyd in that article she states \u201cwe all Lie, all the time.\u201d After I read just that part, I was like really? I\u2019m probably not older than that lady and as expected, she\u2019s got me figured out from the first lie I told about using my allowance to buy candy, to the present? Ok, you got me! Yes, I was a liar, and I am putting emphasis on \u201cwas\u201d because, though I admit to my past discretions, I am trying to improve on being truthful. Yay! I'm saved now ;)\n\nThe reason is that, it may be all cool like I got away with something, but things like that have a tendency to come back and bite you in the area of your body you use to sit. The reason we lie? Speaking for myself, I was trying to avoid a whipping for lying to my mom when she asked if I spent all of my allowance on candy so in essence, I was trying to save my own butt. \n\nThere are many reasons why we lie to ourselves to make our decisions better. For example, a job applicant who lies on a job resume to make himself look better as a candidate for a position, or the student who lies about cheating on a test my make himself look scholarly and the degree. So, I would agree with Ms. Lloyd\u2019s statement that \u201cwe all lie, all the time. I would also ask the reader of this article to confess and work on the practice of being truthful, and if you  say you\u2019ve never lied about anything, I say please read this section of the article again. \n\n**Study Source: [LiveScience](http://www.livescience.com/772-lie.html)**\n\n# **Everyone being ignorant maintains our ignorance:**\n\n<center>http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/21/article-0-0B462D3300000578-655_1024x615_large.jpg</center>\n\n**Image Source: [DailyMail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk)**\n\nThis comes from a condition called Pluralistic Ignorance. Trust me the official definition will be found on a link I will provide. The reason I\u2019m not quoting this is that, it is way too long to enter for this article. Now, the informal definition which I have, comes from a game called follow the leader, meaning that groups of people tend to follow what one or a few people would consider to be the normal behavior. \n\nSome individuals may not agree to all of the ideas of the norm, but they go along with it. It\u2019s so true, in band practice, an entire section of the band might play a song of key because they are afraid of making a mistake. What they may in turn do is wait for the best player to start then they will join in. It is unfortunately common, but we harm ourselves in this behavior. \n\nThus as individuals, we do maintain our ignorance by not stepping out and taking chances in order to grow and advance intellectually. The best example in the article was in regards to the instructor asking the class if they have questions or if they understood the material and, no one said anything. Needless to say, it backs up the subtopic statement \u201cEveryone being ignorant maintains our ignorance. \n\n**Study Source: [ChangingMinds](http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/pluralistic_ignorance.htm)**\n\n# **Conclusion:**\n\nThose three inaccurate ways people think socially are just incredible and  have detrimental effects on people today just as they have done throughout history. Instead of improving ourselves and leaving a better world for our children, we still have hostile feelings towards people different from themselves and use that to justify mistreating other people because they want everyone to look and be like them. The second topic of how we lie so we feel good about ourselves I would agree is an interesting on because it has gone on so long that lying has become a lifestyle for most people. And the final topic, of \u201cEveryone Being Ignorant maintains our ignorance is requires deep thought for the reader because unless we as individuals learn to take chances in life and be the brave one to answer the question first, we may be following the one we think is the smartest one when in fact he or she is not.\n\nAnd oh by the way, I hope you liked and enjoyed reading my article.

All STEEM Dollars for these posts go to the featured author.</strong></strike>\n\n<strike><strong>If you are looking to be featured as an author, please contact me via email - ben.adaptnetwork@gmail.com</strong></strike>\n\n<strong>Edit: From the comments, it seems that this type of author promotion is not the way to go. A 're-steemit' button has been suggested and I think this is a great idea.</strong>\n\n<hr>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6z5In5y.jpg\"/></center>\n\nIf you've played the indie-hit video game <a href=\"http://www.firewatchgame.com/\">FireWatch</a>, by Campo Santo, then chances are that you fell in love with the idea of staying in a fire tower, just as I have.\n\nThe American novelist and poet, Jack Kerouac, famously spent the summer of 1956 manning a fire tower on Washington\u2019s Desolation Peak, in the northern Cascades. Even though he was alone with pencil and paper by design, he didn\u2019t get much writing done. I don\u2019t blame him, the views from the tower are incredible and there\u2019s plenty to fill an adventurer\u2019s time for 63 days.\n\nSo, if the idea of a few days in the sky in a cool-looking fire tower is appealing, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that you can actually rent one of these bad boys.\n\nSince Jack Kerouac\u2019s stay in the 50s, new technologies have made fire lookouts mostly obsolete, some were even torn down. Others were left to rust and splinter, becoming squatter\u2019s dens and canvases for high-altitude graffiti artists. But dozens around the US have survived and are available for rent, evolving into modest sources of revenue for the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s depleted accounts. The Forest Fire Lookout Association maintains a list of available towers; many are available for as little as $20 a night.\n\n<strong>Lets take a look at a few below:</strong>\n\n<h2>1. Black Mountain Lookout, California</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tbHIiBQ.jpg\"/></center>\n\nBlack Mountain Lookout is located on the eastern edge of the Beckwourth Ranger District, 10 miles from Highway 395, near Milford, California.\n\nThe lookout was constructed in 1934 and is a great example of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) architecture. The C-3-type lookout is situated on a single story 10 foot tower and is extremely well-preserved.\n\nThe one-room lookout cabin is set on a tower, rising 10 feet above the ground. It is furnished with two single beds with mattresses, but can accommodate up to four people. There is also space for tent camping adjacent to the lookout, for up to four visitors.\n\n<strong>A closer look in pictures:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NX0S10Y.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HgS38WU.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ULzb0dV.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ljj8y7X.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>2. Hirz Mountain Lookout, California</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6z5In5y.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThis fire tower sits atop Hirz Mountain, California at an elevation of 3,540 feet, offering 360-degree views of Mt. Shasta\u2019s snow-laced peak to the north.\n\nThe McCloud River Wintu tribe held Hirz Mountain in reverence and had a name for it in their own language. But it was a miner, Henry Hirz, who gave the mountain its modern name.\n\nWhen the lookout was built, it was originally a structure that sat on the ground. The mountain was a strategic location for detecting fires because it had a direct view into the headwaters of the McCloud River and most of its tributaries. In 1937, the Forest Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps rebuilt the Hirz Mountain Lookout cabin and included a garage and outhouse. It was one of the last CCC-era lookouts to be built. In 1949, a steel tower was added, constructed of a steel K-brace tower that stands 20 feet above ground level.\n\n<strong>A quick look inside the tower:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uZq8dZ5.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZCHllVy.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>3. Hornet Lookout, Montana</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bD8F1wJ.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe Hornet Lookout is as old school as it gets and features a two-story construction. The ground level provides a living space for two guests and the second story is a small loft used solely for full views of the region. The lookout\u2019s rustic accommodations include a propane cook stove, propane lantern and a small wood stove for heat.\n\nThe lookout provides astounding 360-degree views of the surrounding terrain, including Glacier National Park and Kintla Lake on clear days. Apparently, on some nights, the Northern Lights may be seen from the lookout.\n\n<strong>A 'slightly' more modern look:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fbAMzHn.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>4. Fall Mountain Lookout Cabin, Oregon</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/EyIpkj8.jpg\"/></center>\n\nFall Mountain Lookout Tower is situated about 20 miles from John Day, in central Oregon. It provides 360-degree views of the surrounding Strawberry Mountain Wildness, as well as the towns of Seneca and Mt. Vernon.\n\nThe tower was built in 1933 and sits at an elevation of 5,949 feet. Before satellite surveillance systems, lookout personnel monitored the forest from this 18-foot perch for signs of smoke, alerting fire guards when necessary. Today guests can watch the sun rise and set, spot wildlife from the catwalk and witness dramatic thunderstorms that traverse the territory during summer months.\n\nThe one-room, 14-by-14 cabin sits atop an 18-foot tower and sleeps two. The cabin is furnished with a futon bed and a table and chairs. It has electricity and in the kitchen area, an electric stove and refrigerator.\n\n<strong>Here's a few more snaps:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fVoStKq.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/sUrDl58.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3CrgXdi.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LejQWOZ.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>5. Indian Ridge Lookout, Oregon</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/861cU5N.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe Indian Ridge Lookout sits at an elevation of 5,405 feet in the Willamette National Forest. Indian Ridge was named for the old Indian hunting trail that runs along the summit.\n\nBuilt in 1958, the lookout was used for firefighting by Forest Service personnel until 1973 and is still staffed occasionally during emergencies.\n\n<strong>A closer look inside the tower:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vBd3iLs.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DKt5G2z.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FJePMYG.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ULzb0dV.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>6. Little Guard Lookout, Idaho</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ifhnbPK.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe newest tower on this list, the Little Guard Lookout is located about 9 miles north of Shoshone Camp, was one of the last remaining fire lookouts used in the Coeur d\u2019Alene River area and has only just recently become inactive.\n\nThe structure standing today on Little Guard Peak is the third in a series of lookout buildings that originated back to 1919. In October 1990, Little Guard Lookout was accepted for listing in the National Historic Lookout Register and the first for Idaho.\n\nThe fully furnished two-story fire lookout has dimensions of 14 x 14 feet, an external cat walk, and a gabled roof. It sleeps four guests, but space is tight. The kitchen is on the ground floor and is equipped with a small propane refrigerator, propane cook stove, table, chairs and basic cooking utensils.\n\n<strong>A few more photos:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NXtu1ZE.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/pPy4Dxj.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wuBRx3w.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>7. Spruce Mountain Fire Lookout Tower</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dkazLmP.jpg\"/></center>\n\nPerched atop a forested mountain, Spruce Mountain Fire Lookout Tower offers panoramic views that include Medicine Bow Peak, Rob Roy Reservoir, Jelm Mountain and the southern end of the Snowy Range. After being occupied as a fire lookout, the 55-foot tall structure was renovated and opened to the public for overnight rental in 1977.\n\nThe lookout cabin is furnished with two single beds with mattresses and can accommodate up to four guests. Inside amenities include a table with chairs, cookware, dishes, utensils, cleaning supplies, a propane heater, propane cook stove and oven, propane refrigerator and propane lights.\n\n<em>All photos: courtesy <a href=\"http://www.recreation.gov/\">Recreation.gov</a></em>\n\n<strong>For more information on renting one of these towers visit <a href=\"http://www.firelookout.org/lookout-rentals.html\">firelookout.org</a>.

If it is impossible, then the mirror represents a basic symmetry of nature. If it is possible, then nature is not symmetric in that way, and the change matters to the laws of nature. This touches on some of the most unexpected discoveries in the history of physics and includes a clue to a basic puzzle about the cosmos\u2014namely, how atoms could exist. \n\n----------------------\n\n# Our \ufb01rst mirror re\ufb02ects space, exchanging left and right. Physicists call this parity. \n\n<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Parity_1drep.png</center>\n<center>wikipedia</center>\n\n\nOur universe was long assumed to possess parity. Newton\u2019s laws of motion and the laws of electromagnetism work exactly the same way in the re\ufb02ected world. In 1956, Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee realized that the nuclear forces, the force responsible for beta decay, make a fundamental distinction between left and right. Their theory was later con\ufb01rmed by Chien-Shiung Wu. Beta decay almost always emits particles in one direction (i.e., asymmetrically), following a right-hand rule.\n\n-------------------\n\n# The next mirror is not a re\ufb02ection in space but in the properties of matter, called charge conjugation. This mirror turns matter into antimatter, and vice versa.\n\n<center>http://www.lhc-closer.es/webapp/files/1435504471_46ed2c40babcc6bacacc2743c3ed3bcd.jpg</center>\n<center>[lhc](http://www.lhc-closer.es/webapp/files/1435504471_46ed2c40babcc6bacacc2743c3ed3bcd.jpg)</center>\n \nAntimatter was predicted in 1927 by English physicist Paul Dirac, who was trying to reconcile relativity and quantum theory. Antimatter is made of antiparticles\u2014particles of the same mass but opposite electric charge to the particles in the matter we know. Dirac\u2019s prediction was con\ufb01rmed when positrons, of the same mass but opposite charge as electrons, were discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson. Why matter is so common and antimatter is so rare is actually a profound mystery. What would an antimatter universe look like? It would look pretty much the same as our universe. Positrons would repel positrons just like electrons repel electrons, and so forth. However, charge conjugation is not an exact symmetry. As with parity, the direction of beta decay is \ufb02ipped. However, if you combine parity and charge conjugation\u2014in other words, \ufb02ip the universe twice, beta decay looks symmetrical again! One asymmetry that remains in this double-\ufb02ipped universe has to do with rare particles called K-mesons. The combination of these laws is almost, but not quite, a symmetry. \n\n--------------------\n\n# The third and \ufb01nal mirror is time-transformation exchanging future and past. \n\n<center>https://www.phy.anl.gov/mep/atta/images/EDM_Figure.jpg</center>\n<center>[phy.anl.gov](https://www.phy.anl.gov/mep/atta/images/EDM_Figure.jpg)</center>\n\nIt does not seem possible that this is a symmetry, thanks to the second law of thermodynamics, the arrow of time. However, the second law is always about huge numbers of particles, and it is only a statistical law. Entropy decreasing is not strictly impossible, only incredibly unlikely. When 2 similarly charged particles approach each other, at a certain point they repel and \ufb02y apart. Run the process backward, and it looks exactly the same. No one is quite sure how to solve this paradox: The universe seems to have time-symmetric laws, but its large-scale behavior is not at all the same in the time mirror.\n\n----------------------\n\n# Together, relativity and quantum theory imply that the combination of all 3 mirrors must be an exact symmetry of nature. \n\n\n<center>http://www.antimaterie.at/fileadmin/downloads/cpt_symmetry_detailed_a_01.png</center>\n<center>[antimaterie](http://www.antimaterie.at/fileadmin/downloads/cpt_symmetry_detailed_a_01.png)</center>\n\nCharge, Parity, and Time Reversal (CPT) Symmetry \n\n-------------------------\n\n# Symmetry  in Sci-fi\n\n<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Journeyfarsidesun.jpg</center>\n<center>wikipedia</center>\n\n\nThe spaceship in the science \ufb01ction movie Doppelg\u00e4nger visits a version of Earth that was re\ufb02ected in the parity-mirror. \n\n----------------------------",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>I have mentally struggled with this situation for many years. &nbsp;My family was extremely frugal. &nbsp;So frugal in fact that my mom did the majority of shopping at Goodwill and had an advanced method of switching the tags so she could get better pricing. &nbsp;She would even purchase the clothes and then take those tags off and put them on a different pair of clothes we out grew. <strong>&nbsp;This was clearly dishonest and I have never stooped this this level myself.</strong> &nbsp;If you aren't from the United States Goodwill is a second hand store. &nbsp;It is like going to a garage / yard sale that is inside. &nbsp;All Goodwill stores smell the same way for some reason. &nbsp;Kind of like a couch that has been left in a shed since 1972. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm not complaining I'm just stating the facts. &nbsp;This frugal nature has rubbed off on me as well and I rarely buy new clothes. &nbsp;We did have certain things that were nice and the best part about growing up where I did is that we had privacy and 36 acres of land. &nbsp;I did a lot of work for farmers growing up and was able to purchase dirt bikes, four wheelers, snowmobiles, and an ultralight aircraft. &nbsp;Honestly I had a lucky childhood in a lot of ways. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Making Payments</strong></h1>\n<p>By the time I was born my parents already had the property paid off and also had a rental house which was the next property over paid off. &nbsp;They did this by just being super frugal and pinching every penny. &nbsp;They also never made payments on vehicles. &nbsp;I remember having a girlfriend in high school that had car payments to make and all her family members cars had loans on them too. &nbsp;That was really weird to me. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have continued this trend of <strong>NOT</strong> making car payments by driving a 2001 Pontiac. &nbsp;It isn't worth much at this point but it runs well and it doesn't cost me much to operate. &nbsp;I don't have a problem with this but once in awhile it kind of gets to me when people almost act like I'm some scrub because I drive an older car. &nbsp;Then you realize they have a 6 year note on their car. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong......I sort of get it. &nbsp;It would be fun to drive a new car and all that. &nbsp;I just don't want payments on stuff. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I FUCKING hate the fact that I don't have my house paid off yet.</strong> &nbsp;I almost have it paid off but still just putting in the sacrifice month after month. &nbsp;I have a 15 year note and have really been chipping away at the principle but it is like the struggle never ends. &nbsp;I feel like I should have had it paid off by now. &nbsp;But then again it is just me over here. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ultimately sometimes I wonder if the struggle is worth it and if I shouldn't just have a 30 year note and make car payments for 7 years and have rented furniture and live the <strong>No Equity Life Style</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>The Conundrom</h1>\n<p>We can die any second. &nbsp;We will often hear about people in their 20's dying in their sleep. &nbsp;Or some random car accident takes out a whole family. &nbsp;<strong>Sometimes I just want to sell out of everything and travel the world and ball out of control.</strong></p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong my life is pretty cool but it could be out of control if I liquidated this property and then applied some leverage and just went rock star status. &nbsp;The struggle is real. &nbsp;I keep thinking in the back of my mind that if I can become \"Bitty Rich\" that all my problems will be solved! &nbsp;<strong>Below is the car I want to get if this happens. &nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2>What do you think Steemit? &nbsp;Have you also dealt with the mental burden of putting in the sacrifice vs just living a no equity life style and living it up? &nbsp;</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/19/vaydor783e1.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"456\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong> &nbsp;The car is a Vaydor. &nbsp;There are only about 20 of these in the world and it is was designed by Matt McEntegart in the Tampa, Florida area. &nbsp;Visit their website at <a href=\"http://vaydorexotics.com/\">http://vaydorexotics.com/</a> to find out more information. &nbsp;If you have seen Suicide Squad that is the car that the Joker is driving! &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/07/31/me-holding-steemitsign-grey-at407c2.png\" width=\"611\" height=\"396\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "# This is an unusual and remarkable story. Though it's beginning is far from inspiring, what it does show is that even devastation can deliver something great. \n\nhttp://belwas.netne.net/images/mk1.jpg\n\n\nI really dislike the term \u201c_Everything happens for a reason._\u201d It minimises and invalidates peoples experiences. Terrible things happen. They shouldn't but they do. I don't believe in fate. I do believe though, that within whatever chance and circumstance delivers, there is opportunity.\u00a0\n\nRecently I have been recovering from running ultra marathons in support of an Australian charity - Bravehearts. They hold an annual event in which participants run seven marathons in consecutive days, starting on the West Coast of Australia and making our way east, finishing on day seven on the Gold Coast in the North East of the country. I am not an athlete, so for me it was no mean feat. My motivation came from an unlikely encounter with a man who has changed me forever, after a man I loved dearly almost destroyed my faith in humanity. \n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12512529_911445782308699_2762424771008664825_n.jpg?oh=5b1eda98b8dc78ec8124e737b19b1fbb&oe=584BDD64\n\n\nAs I was nursing physical injuries sustained in the run, I allowed myself to be still for the first time in a very long time, and I registered with Steemit.\u00a0I believed that a week or two would suffice, and I would then gratefully return to my regular life. In my attempt to restore the life that I new, I brushed over the context of the run in my introductory post. But it was a cause that had completely consumed me, and has proved to be not so easily processed. \n\nAt the completion of the event, I stumbled into July, hoping to find my feet, both literally and figuratively. It is now almost two months since the marathons finished. I have mostly contained the injuries, triumph, bereavement, achievement, and emotion. Throwing myself back into life I have busied myself and now I realise that in doing so I have held it at arms length, and therefore find myself no closer to processing exactly what it is that I accomplished.\n\n# So here it is.\nI\u2019m not sure if this is a rambling journal. I am certainly no journalist, but I feel the need to share my story, or at the very least record it for myself and for those who helped me achieve it. In an attempt to start, I am going to share the journey that has brought me to this day. I could start at a number of places, but I think 2009 is the best reference point.\n\n# On a night not unlike any other in 2009\n\nI am sitting at home with my family. The channel ten news is rolling in the background, and I am going about the bustle of family, evening chaos. A typical, uneventful and otherwise mundane night in a humble suburban home. I stare in the general direction of the television, but am not really watching it. My husband remarks with a hint of alarm in his voice, **_\"Are you seeing this?\"_**\n\nA news story is rolling. Yes I was looking at the TV, so I suppose I was seeing it, but I wasn't really taking it in. We see so much news coming at us all the time, I think we filter it out a lot. It was washing over me, someone else\u2019e story, the news very seldom impacts my tiny existence. So I fix my attention on the screen, and watch as a man is arrested. His face blurred, he is being walked up a driveway. Suddenly the home he is being walked from, flanked by detectives, is familiar. The figure despite the blurred face, unmistakably so.\n\n## The man with the blurred face was my uncle. \nHeld up on pedestal in our family, I had strived my whole life to impress him. Catching the end of the news story, I learned he was arrested for multiple counts of child sexual abuse.\u00a0\n\nI didn't fully understand it at the time, but it is at this very point, that so much that I thought I new was wiped away. The foundation of my life, my childhood memories and the world they were based upon, from this moment were void of truth.\u00a0\n\nhttp://belwas.netne.net/images/IMG_6697.jpg\n_Me at age 4._\n\nHe pled not guilty to scores of charges, the court proceedings were drawn out over years, with multiple complainants, who spanned decades. The cases were split, evidence from one case was prohibited from being shared in another, and jurors were unaware of them entirely. Following a hung jury, and an acquittal, he was eventually found guilty of a number of charges in another case in 2012.\u00a0\n\nI attended the sentencing hearing. The victims had been employees of his, and although they were now adults, some of their faces were familiar to me. The room was full. I hadn't been in such an environment before, and I found myself to my horror, sitting with his supporters. These people heckled and shouted as the charges were read out. The irreverence of these people, to attempt to take from the survivors and their families their moment of justice disgusted me, and I was appalled that I may be mistaken as one of them.\n\n**_I was there to witness the proceedings for my own reasons, and to support my beautiful father as he attempted to process his own complex position, as this man\u2019s brother._**\n\n# It was one of the hardest things I have ever done. \nI sat through almost two hours as each charge was read and detailed. I held my father like he was my child. My uncle entered escorted through a little door that led him to the witness box. I barely recognised him, he addressed me by name and for a moment it felt like the entire world shifted below my feet. I left feeling like I needed to hold my breath in order to walk tall, and to a degree I carry that feeling to this day. Almost like if I exhale fully maybe I will unravel permanently and not be able to recoil myself. I manufactured a strength that became an armour I couldn't take off, and now I don't think I know how to, nor would I want to.\u00a0\n\nI am glad I went. It made the devastating and until now surreal situation very real. It changed me, but not in a bad way. I am more inclined to make decisions for myself and less inclined to give a thought to judgements made by other people. **_When the person you always looked to as your safety net turns out to be only smoke and mirrors, you stop looking to be saved and save yourself instead._** More importantly I laid my eyes on another man. A man who sat directly across from my uncle. His presence was impossible to ignore.\n\n\n**This man was Kevin Whitley.** He sat opposite my uncle. Directly across, and stared at him, holding an indomitable glare the entire time. In his eyes was triumph, anger, pain, fury, pride, satisfaction and pure strength. I assumed he was a parent or support person for the young men he sat in front of. His powerful presence seemed to shield the men behind him, who were sitting I learned later, in the jury seating, as the room was so full.\n\n## I couldn't wipe the mans face from my mind.\n\nThe names of the people who gave evidence during the cases were suppressed. Two men however asked that their names be lifted from the suppression orders so they could share there own stories. It was then, when I saw this mans face in [a newspaper article](http://www.theleader.com.au/story/300346/victims-urge-others-to-speak-out/), that I learned that he was a complainant in the earlier case that had been acquitted.\u00a0\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13315235_251448791882668_8177550636171283508_n.jpg?oh=c3c4156725db82620ba385e249fa9670&oe=583C5B73\n_Kevin, myself and Mark at 1 in Five Gala_\n\n\n\n## I couldn't shake that day. I couldn't shake that face. I decided to write to him. I wrote, and I tore up the letters, and I rewrote. I couldn't even start. What would I say?\nMostly I worried that I would traumatise this man, and potentially intrude on his life uninvited, and cause him more pain. But I needed to do it. I needed to tell this man who I was, and where I stood, and how, unknowingly he had impacted me.\u00a0\n\nSo eventually, almost a year later, I stood at a letterbox for the longest time. With my heart pulsing in my ears, and with a trembling hand, I dropped the latest version of my hand written letter into the letterbox. I had easily found his Facebook account, which linked to his business address. I marked the letter- \"Private and confidential - To be opened by addressee only,\u201d and included a Po Box return address.\u00a0\n\nThe months passed, and although I was consumed by my own life, not least of which was the surprise news that I was expecting a child, I often wondered if he had received it, and how he had reacted. A Facebook request popped up from him, and I freaked out and changed my settings. Okay, that confirmed it, he had definitely received it!\u00a0\n\nBut I didn't know this man. He had my PO Box address. Facebook in my mind was not the way to go, to link our lives, our families and friends, and our children. I couldn't imagine that could ever happen.\u00a0\n\nI thought about him from time to time, but life is busy, and the years passed.\u00a0\n\n## In October 2015 I received a letter. Before I opened it I new it was him. It was addressed with the very same phrasing I had written years before to him.\n\nThe letter was lovely. I had a positive impact on this man. I had helped him. He had even used my letter as the basis for a speech he had recently delivered as a key note speaker at a police ball, in support of an organisation I had never heard of - **Bravehearts.** At the end of the letter was a youtube link to his speech, and a request to meet.\n\nThe speech was incredible. He had utilised a phrase I had used in my letter, \u201c**Ripple Effect**,\u201d to formulate a message of survival, hope and courage. Towards the end of his speech he reached into his pocket, and pulled out my letter. In conclusion to his speech he read my letter aloud to a packed room. **_Holy shit!!_**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhLnue3qoGs\n_Kevin Whitley's speech_ \n\n\n## I watched the video a number of times and googled Bravehearts.\n\nI felt many things, exposed, overwhelmed, proud, these words don\u2019t seem to do justice to how it was that I felt. I emailed him to arrange a meeting.\n\nWe met in a coffee shop in Cronulla, a southern beach side suburb of Sydney. Cronulla holds a great number of long suppressed memories for me, so returning there was both confronting and cathartic. I knew what he looked like, but he didn\u2019t know me. We had a coffee, and I felt surprisingly comfortable.\n\nWhen I had researched Bravehearts, I had come across Bravehearts Adventures, and discovered they held an annual event called the Bravehearts777. Participants run seven marathons, in seven days, in seven states, across Australia.\n\n## At that first meeting as strangers, I propose I run it for him, in his name. \nHe asked me, _\u201cAre you a runner?\u201d_\nI said, _\u201cNo,\u201d_ and laughed.\n_\u201cHave you even done a half marathon before?\u201d_\nI said, _\u201cNO, but I enjoyed the odd fun run before I had a baby last year.\u201d_\n\nHe told me later that he thought I was completely bonkers, but by the end of the day we had decided to enter together. We registered a team which he aptly named, \u201cThe Ripple Effect,\u201d and launched our fundraising campaign. We aimed to raise at least $20,000 for Bravehearts, and also hoped that our story would inspire others to come forward and stand together to effect positive change. **In Australia 1 in 5 children will experience sexual assault before the age of eighteen**. \n\n## With the help of friends, family and the community, and the help of an extraordinary journalist by the name of Daniel Sutton, we hosted among other events, a Cocktail Gala named 1inFive, and achieved a total of $31,847.30 for Bravehearts.\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13310590_251449075215973_2317871616207391497_n.jpg?oh=7c771dfae339df1930ffed206167d7a5&oe=584AC32C\n_Giving speech at 1 in Five gala_\n\nOver the months, Kevin and I worked together to promote our cause, and tentatively navigated our unusual relationship. To call it a friendship in these early days, would be over simplifying the complex situation.\nWe did however seem to trust one another from the start. We both had our reasons for taking this on, so our shared dedication was enough to unite us. \n\nI specifically mentioned the journalist Daniel Sutton. Daniel\u2019s continued involvement is another incredible twist of fate in this story. Incidentally he was the journalist who ran the original arrest story in 2009. He also jumped in at the last minute to host a Bravehearts charity ball, and unbeknown to him Kevin was the speaker on the night. It was only after hearing Kevin speak that he realised the connection. When we formed our team, he promoted our campaign by covering our unusual partnership on the national evening news.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yXr4nY25fM\nWhile shooting the story he showed no hesitation when Kevin asked him to host the Gala. I said earlier that I am not a great believer in fate but I must say Daniel\u2019s involvement certainly challenges that notion. Daniels uncanny connection to our story, and ongoing support, is at the very least testament to his good character and decency. Thank you Daniel. TV journalism needs more Daniel Suttons.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13331013_1017358118341397_1783300328613611685_n.jpg?oh=5ca1a4567f8154be0fea38b8bbb33787&oe=5881CE31\n_Daniel Sutton hosting the 1 in Five gala_\n\n# Australia is currently holding a Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse.\n\nAll survivors nationwide have been invited to lodge a submission to the independent inquiry. As Kevin\u2019s case against my uncle had been acquitted he had never been able to make a victims impact statement. The Royal Commission presented an opportunity to truly share his perspective. Because of the acquittal the media have only been able to refer to Kevin as a whistle blower, or complainant. If they were to use any other term in relation to my uncle, they would breach the legal rights of an incarcerated child predator, and risk litigation. The inquiry however is open to all people who consider themselves survivors, regardless of court proceedings and findings. Our joint campaign and the enquiry had given Kevin the platform he was hoping to find, when he bravely released his name in 2012.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10441403_207055346322013_4098129798661330165_n.jpg?oh=26c14b28c9f944a3991726622d133583&oe=58863B96\n\nKevin was overseas when he was called to appear. He requested that the date be changed, however the nature of the proceedings made this impossible. When he asked me to read his statement on his behalf, I surprised him by agreeing to do it immediately. It wasn\u2019t a difficult decision. To me, this was what our team was actually about. We weren\u2019t runners. The running event provided us with an opportunity to speak to survivors and encourage them, regardless of the situation to stand together for the protection of all children. \n\n### The Royal Commission was the perfect opportunity to show Kevin I was truly committed, for reasons that went beyond a fun run.\n\nMy uncle sent barristers to the hearing to appose my reading of Kevin\u2019s statement. Down to the last minutes I didn\u2019t know if I would be allowed to take the stand. Eventually parts of Kevin\u201ds statement were redacted and I was allowed to read the statement in his absence. The hearings stream live, and I read Kevin\u2019s account in the first person, to the open court.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WchgjuLlsk\n\n## Something else remarkable happened that day. \nI met Mark Lawrence, the other man who had released his name in court in 2012. Mark was a complainant in the case that was not acquitted, and we can therefore call him a survivor of my uncle without fear of litigation. I mindfully use the word survivor rather than victim, as through his difficult life he has not only survived but gone on to thrive. Mark is a true survivor and an inspiration.  He himself a Bravehearts ambassador, Mark had by now already joined our team and although I felt like I already new him,  I had never met him in person before. \n### We sat together as support person for each other, and since that day he has called me sister. \n\nMark lives hundreds of miles away and had flown down to Sydney for the enquiry. He promised to return again for the fundraiser, and true to his word he returned to Sydney, bass in hand, and along with Kevin and his band, he rocked the night.\n\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13312666_249331448761069_273127193222300716_n.jpg?oh=c5ccc115695e48ebbab8b075a4f9d676&oe=5884BA53\n_Mark playing bass with Kevin & his band MOJO at 1 in Five Gala_\n\n\nThe fundraiser was a wonderful success, not only for the thousands of dollars raised, but for the remarkable way in which our families and friends came together. The room was filled with nothing but love and support from everyone. I was expecting a powerful emotive evening, but I wasn\u2019t expecting to have so much fun.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13344537_251896798504534_5406985480071200099_n.jpg?oh=0b175203cc9b6df01ae60c9d197558b9&oe=58510110\n\n\n\n## We smashed our target, had a cracker of a night and had shared our unified message. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmMABvhl0GI\n\n_Video of Kevin and myself speaking at 1inFive Gala_\n\nOur team now included six people. Kevin, Mark and myself, and also Kevin\u2019s partner Vicki, my brother in law Rob, and Bel one of my dearest and oldest friends. They all pledged to run one of the marathons as state runners, to support my attempt to complete all seven. Kevin would travel with me, his knees too arthritic to run, it would be his tour, and I would be his legs.\n\n# All that stood in my way now was the simple task of running almost 300kms in a week, while flying between capital cities every day.\n\n- - -\n\nI arrived in Perth a couple of days early. I stayed with friends who doted on me, and most importantly I got two good nights sleep. My baby now two years old is still not a brilliant sleeper. The only part of the trip I new I was fully prepared for was the early mornings and limited sleep. My training regime well intended and initially consistent, had been hampered by shift work, family commitments, two solid years of sleep deprivation and a bout of whooping cough six weeks out from the mega run. I had also been feeling the emotional toll of my own complex position, which very much impacted my energy and desire to train. Obligation rather than passion drove my training runs in the final weeks.\n\nThe national team consisted of twenty people including myself and Kevin. We met them in Perth the night before the first marathon. We had flown in from every corner of the country. The team was comprised of teachers, health professionals, students, lawyers, bankers and business people. Many of them were mothers fathers and grandparents. The youngest nineteen years old and the oldest sixty two. We all shared the same goal, irrespective of whether we would complete a marathon in three hours or six and a half hours - To give a voice to those without one, and to help make Australia the safest place to raise a child.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13502087_1015553735231236_4308566568164747538_n.jpg?oh=0f198ebf6615260887606f0b9099f40b&oe=585639D3\n_National team minutes before the start of the first marathon._\n\n\nIn my excitement, on the way to meet the team, and only two blocks from the hotel, I impulsively decided to have the Bravehearts777 running man shaved into the back of my head. I popped into a barbershop on Murray St. The barbers seemed amused by me and chuckled and spoke to each other in arabic as I sat expectantly in the chair. It wasn\u2019t a perfect reproduction of the logo, but more an interpretation of it. It seemed like a good idea at the time\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I\u2019m left trying to decide now whether to grow it out, or take the lot off.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13557665_264453107248903_7567079289670131635_n.jpg?oh=356eea613994ce1a786184125534637c&oe=5857C776\n\nEarly the next day we gathered at the starting line in the south bank of The mighty Swan River. With excitement, anticipation and a good dose of nervousness, we set off along the foreshore. Perth had delivered a beautiful morning. I completed the Perth marathon comfortably and steadily, and finished with a positive mind set.\n\n\nThe team flew to Adelaide, our longest flight, and checked into our hotel late in the evening. Up early the next morning I was psyched to hit the track, and keen to run a sub five hour marathon. The Adelaide run was also a very pretty waterfront run, and in spite of my Ornithophobia (fear of birds), I almost enjoyed seeing the black swans that had also joined us in Perth. We ran along The River Torrens and under a number of beautiful bridges. Bravehearts had carefully planned the the courses to be laps of 7km stretches, 3.5km out and 3.5km back. This allowed participants to support one another along the way. Each time someone passed they would hi five  and check in with each other. We all worked together to ensure everyone got across the line. \n\nAt the completion of my fifth lap I was on track for a comfortable sub five hour run, and feeling on top of the world. I gave Kevin a big hug at the aid station where he sat strumming his guitar, and set off. I rounded a corner and in an attempt to relieve my angry quadriceps I smashed my knee in a ballistic squat /stretch. I was shattered and shuffling. The other runners knew, and as they passed they were a great support. \nOne runner remarked, \u201cKeep going, there is a surprise waiting for you around the corner.\u201d\nAs I shuffled on I could see a figure heading my way. It was Kevin, he had come to my rescue. The man I had pledged to run for, supported me across the finish line.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13754636_1034215736698369_3039748475850617514_n.jpg?oh=e3248318d183802f3ccb958bd2c18d71&oe=583FE9CF\n\n\nI prayed that once we got to Melbourne and I had a good nights sleep, I would be good to go in the morning. Melbourne delivered a beautiful day also, and a lake side run in Albert Park, complete with Black swans. However the overnight wish for a miraculous double knee replacement didn't occur. I did decide though at some point midway, with both my knees strapped on, and every single step feeling like murder, that this was actually not such a bad thing. For a couple of reasons. I thought about the survivors who have told me that they have experienced times in their life that felt worse than murder. I also thought about the promise that I made to Kevin to be his legs for the tour, as both his knees are arthritic. In that case it seemed only appropriate that I should do such a run with blown out knees. I finished in a pretty good frame of mind all things considered, only my knees were protesting, the rest of me had a bloody fabulous time. It also turned out that Captain Kev was very capable of holding his own. He cruised home completing his own half marathon. **CHAMP!**\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13590494_1024330467686896_4431911519295518945_n.jpg?oh=9ab61dbab83a49783aff83510fac8c1a&oe=587E5240\n\nWe flew to Hobart next, the capital of Tasmania. What a charming little city. We didn\u2019t see a hell of a lot of the places we ran. The airport, the drive to the hotel, the drive to the running track, and the 7km lap. I had only been to Tasmania once before. I had visited Launceston and fell in love with the place, but I have never been to Hobart. What I did see of it was divine, a picturesque hidden secret. AND COLD!! To cold for swans too it seemed, not a black swan in sight.\n\nMy broken knees didn\u2019t like the cold at all. I shuffled to the starting line. As long as I shuffled and didn\u2019t lift my feet off the ground, I wasn\u2019t too bad. As the runners set off, I attempted to follow. They ran ahead, their ears plugged with music, and I wailed! I screamed! A down hill start in the cold Tasmanian winter was murder. Even Kevin setting out on his next half marathon walk, with his newly discovered endurance capacity, was ahead of me. He thought I had headed off with the other runners, and with his music in his ears too, he was unaware I was behind him. Our team mentor Shane, one of the amazing support staff had heard me. He rode up behind me on his bike. I refused to give up, so he rode ahead to the aid station at the turn around point to retrieve the first aid supplies. I agreed to meet him there. He also alerted Kevin, who came to my rescue again.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13524390_1457656720927247_147936149042902520_n.jpg?oh=ce007f7ba3f598aa4eba36a54cca5aef&oe=58819DAC\n_Mentor Shane to the rescue_\n\nKevin suggested that maybe I should stop, that I didn\u2019t have to finish or perhaps we could tag the laps and share the distance. I was enraged! Not at Kevin of course, but I was frustrated and devastated. Every piece of me except my knees was willing. I filled with the emotion of our partnership. I screamed through tears. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get to take this from us! He is waiting for me to fail! He is not taking this from you!\u201d \n\nAnd there it was, that was our moment. The very moment that this man became more than a person with a common cause, and I found it, the strength to continue. I tapped back into the reason we were there. I couldn\u2019t really use my knees at this point, so I shuffled using my hips and my ankles. I met Shane at the aid station he taped my knees in place, and Kayleen, a Bravehearts legend, appeared like The Arch Angel Of Over The Counter Anti-inflammatory Analgesia, and I was off. I surprised myself with how fast I could walk, and I finished. I had time for a 30 second shower, and before I new it I was back at Hobart airport.\n\nI lay on the floor at the terminal gate and cried on the phone to my Husband, Dad, Mum, Sister, and a couple of good mates, including of course Mark Lawrence, who had been a great source of encouragement and strength. My sister and her husband Rob who was running the A.C.T marathon, and my mum were meeting me in Canberra in a matter of hours. I couldn\u2019t wait to see my sister, she knows me like only a sister can. I don\u2019t need to say anything, just being in her company would be fantastic.\n\nTo get to Canberra from Hobart we needed to change flights in Sydney. I flew over my home at dusk, and thought of my babies getting ready for bed below me. I actually live under the flight path and passed over them with my heart, and every other part of me aching. I was missing them desperately. Without them I felt like a vital organ had been removed, and I so very much just wanted to rest my head on my husbands shoulder, or to tuck myself perfectly under his arm. Before leaving for Perth I hadn\u2019t even spent one night away from my baby, and my big girl needed me too although she wouldn\u2019t admit it. And I needed them.\n\nWe weren\u2019t in Sydney long. I headed to the connecting flight and there it was. The contraption I had been fearing. A twin propeller plane. At this point I must make mention of Tassie runner Paul. He was buddied up with me for a number of flights, and helped me through a few sketchy moments. A more genuine man you will never meet. I made friends for life on this trip. \n\nMy Sister, her husband, and our mum met me in Canberra. My mum drove hundreds of kilometres to get there. If I thought Hobart was cold then Canberra was brutal. The coldest Australian City in winter, and often the hottest in summer, Canberra is a funny place. It was purpose built as our nations capital, placed between Melbourne and Sydney in an attempt to appease the rival cities, as neither would abide the other having capital status. In 1911 a man named Walter Burley Griffin won a design competition and Canberra was created. It resulted in an overly organised network of roundabouts, connecting a decentralised suburban structure, with parliament house siting on a hill next to a man made lake. A vast contrast to the haphazard chaos of Sydney that I am accustomed to. \n\n## My mum cried when she saw me. She also delivered much needed analgesia that I had asked her to pick up for me when I called her from Hobart. I ate three hamburgers and a couple of painkillers and headed to bed. \n\nMy brother in law ran an impressive marathon. I power shuffled and finished. Granny (my mum), was there with Kevin at the finish line when I crossed. In spite of the pain I had an enjoyable time. Roughly three hours drive from Sydney, it was the closest run to my family, and with some family there too I felt a great lift in my spirits. \n\nWe flew to Coolangatta that night. While I would have loved a run in Sydney I was grateful that the next two runs would be based from the Gold Coast in southern Queensland, with a New South Wales run just a bus ride south, over the boarder in Kingscliff. \n\nMy darling friend Bel who was to run the last marathon with me, had decided to head up early from Sydney when she heard I was struggling. Mark Lawrence, now friends with her since our fundraiser was picking her up. Vicki, Kevin\u2019s partner also joined us when we again changed flights in Sydney. \n\n# THE TEAM WAS TOGETHER.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13599827_1019406064846003_591041660569446787_n.jpg?oh=8bc9c80d6745b14e44826754b4af5c7c&oe=584C43F7\n\nFollowing my brother-in-laws impressive run in Canberra the rest of the team were coming together a day early for the sixth marathon. Kingscliff, with Mark\u2019s home only a stones throw away, was perfect. We took number six very easy. With my team united I was strong. We finished together, crossing the finish line very injured, but somehow feeling stronger than ever. I was also very grateful to not be getting on another plane. Just a bus back to the hotel.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13510933_1459436437415942_2875361158480137514_n.jpg?oh=8f23eaac5ea6c888813a9017c579c518&oe=584B235D\n_Stumbling across finish line no.6 with Mark Lawrence_\n\n\n\nI\u2019m so grateful to Bel. She came to my rescue and cared for me those last couple of days. At one point I asked her to stop being so lovely as I was scared I would totally unravel if I allowed myself to acknowledge how in need of care I was feeling. I had one more marathon to go, I couldn\u2019t afford to let go of the denial that was holding me together. I didn\u2019t really mean it though, she did so much for me, fed me, tended to my wounds, and made me laugh til it hurt as I lay almost broken next to her in our tandem beds. I can\u2019t express my gratitude, Bel is a beautiful human being.\n\nOn day seven we gathered at the starting line. The Gold Coast Airport Marathon is big. It\u2019s an annual event that draws thousands. The crowds lined the streets. The starting line was crammed full of fresh faced healthy excited participants.\n\nWhen I woke up I could barely open my eyes. It seemed the oedema from the salt loss and resulting fluid shift was no longer confined to my hands and feet. My face was puffy, and I could hardly walk. I let myself have a couple of minutes to cry in the bathroom, then I gathered myself, ate some salt, donned my running gear, and shuffled to the hotel lobby.\n\nThe Bravehearts team gathered on day seven with several of us injured, some to the point that they had decided to withdraw from the last run. They came down nonetheless to support the other. Incredible people, thinking of others, and all the while carrying their own disappointment and injuries, and reliving their own personal experiences and reasons for undertaking this trip. \n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13615019_268437330183814_6354769589680029094_n.jpg?oh=933ead0308e197126c3e333f9ea8e79f&oe=58457CEF\n\n\nEvery National runner had an inspiring and very personal story. By this stage it is not about a passion for running. It\u2019s not about running at all. By the last marathon we are all wearing our personal journey like armour as we triumphantly take to the streets. Surrounded by the shiny, healthy, positive runners lining the street, I felt like I knew something they didn\u2019t, with my swollen knees and ankles taped on, and skin torn away in places from the previous days strapping. \n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13510856_1460165300676389_7805125680339716398_n.jpg?oh=6a44270f20e2210e87adafc567cf9a8d&oe=58433850\n\nPeople talk about taking journeys and learning that they are capable of more, blah, blah, blah\u2026\u2026\u2026\nI\u2019m not about to be one of those people. But I will say this. \n\nDon\u2019t set your expectations of yourself or of what is possible, by the limitations of someone else\u2019s mind. Don\u2019t be scared to step outside of yourself and attempt something someone else tells you you can\u2019t do. Turn their doubt on its head and treat it as a challenge. \n\nAnd if you feel like you need to tell someone something, or maybe you can articulate better if you write and have the opportunity to find the right words, don\u2019t let this misguided world tell you that you shouldn\u2019t or you can\u2019t. \n\nI believe we only ask people for advice to hear what we already know mirrored back at us, to help us find the courage to do what we already know we need to do. So if you are sure you need to do something, do it, don\u2019t wait for permission from others. The same people who told me not to, or suggested that working with Kevin was \u201cinappropriate\u201d have congratulated and supported our ongoing work. \n\n## It\u2019s okay to be the person to redefine what is acceptable and possible.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13501784_1456918131001106_4578029372569800268_n.jpg?oh=acf47c30fd5bc3e2c683f91e551ae89e&oe=58413BFC \n\nI started out on the last run very slowly. Runner after runner passed me. With Bel at my side I cheered for each one as they passed us, and Bel proudly told everyone that I was running number 7 in a week. \n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13627148_975661049213348_1249945599263937991_n.jpg?oh=3d972731a98fb39346b7d8624d36a4e6&oe=58496043\n\nUnlike the last six, this marathon had cutoff times at certain points along the way. So I kept an eye on my borrowed Garmin and kept on shuffling. Every time I felt pain, instead of crying out, I yell **Woohoo!** I told myself it was fabulous and fabulous it became. I let the crowd carry us along. **_I imagined carrying my pain in my pocket, and when that didn\u2019t work, I imagined my pain running and I allowed it to do the work, and I visualised myself sitting in it\u2019s pocket._**\n\nI utilised many different shuffling techniques. When one group of muscles started to hurt, I changed it up a bit and shuffled in a slightly different fashion. By halfway I found my groove, and and started to pass the now less shiny looking runners, who had started out so strong and were now walking. Unlike them, with 21kms to go, I could taste the finish line already.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13606764_975661135880006_8708852275673918701_n.jpg?oh=9bbc5ee22d5c5727a95d8ab0cf40eb30&oe=583F7793\n\n# As I was counting down the kilometres I looked around and realise - I HAVE DONE IT! Well, - I HAVE NEARLY DONE IT!  \nWith very little training and a huge amount of stubbornness, denial, a touch of the crazies and a bloody important message, I have almost completed the Bravehearts777.\n\nBel and I trotted on side by side. We crossed the finish line together, our team waiting. Kevin wrapped me in his arms, and the rest of the team folded around us. I\u2019m not sure how long we remained like this, Kevin let go of his rock star bravado and we both shed a tear. I will treasure that moment for the rest of my life.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13590450_976198829159570_3534310572218008127_n.jpg?oh=74b567d0baec0821332ce679d7ce0b39&oe=583D6A35\n\nWe embarked on this event together, hoping to carefully navigate the sensitive nature of our relationship. Of all the things that I expected to come from this endeavour, I did not expect to come to love this man. Sometime during that week, or perhaps as a culmination of our shared experiences that week, and in the months prior, Kevin Whitley and Mark Lawrence moved into my heart.\n\nI spoke with Kevin recently and said exactly that, \u201cI love you. I didn\u2019t expect that I would. I thought we could accomplish something pretty amazing together, but I didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d\nHe replied, \u201cI love you too Margie.\u201d\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13307384_1017363855007490_6520994094825267830_n.jpg?oh=47c2288c49fdb3bf2dd48e5edc68446b&oe=5882BBA7\n\n###People say you can\u2019t choose your family. You might not be able to choose who you are genetically related to, but you can most certainly choose who you consider family, and who you call your brother.\n\nPeople have also told me that I have done something amazing for Kevin, but he has done so much for me too. He restored my faith in human beings. What I did for Kevin wasn\u2019t amazing, it was just the right thing that rippled along as it went, then other people helped us both build it into something. The Ripple Effect isn't Kevin's or mine, it belongs to everyone who continues to speak out and demand a safer future for our children.\n\nFollowing our great feat, many of the National runners featured in follow up stories in their local news. We didn\u2019t feature in any news articles in our home town of Sydney despite our attempts to engage our local rag. Perhaps this retraction of an article that ran prior to our run explains why.  \n\nhttp://www.belwas.netne.net/images/IMG_6269.JPG\n\n**We won\u2019t be silenced or intimidated**. During our fundraising Kevin spoke to many people. The responses were surprising, varied and unpredictable. One person who was impacted by the Whitley Ripple was Sam McAuliffe. Sam donated a beautiful bike that was auctioned at out fundraiser.  Bel caught wind of the fact that my daughter had her eye on it and out bid everyone to secure it for her.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13265915_249944915366389_3084676633044616038_n.jpg?oh=6dc2ff3357b4120209730798ecf06044&oe=5855EBC6\n\n Sam has entered a team for next year and will be running all seven marathons, and her team mate, my darling Bel will be running beside her in every one. Kevin and I have joined their team too, and will run one or two as state runners to support them.\n\n## The Ripple Effect is real. Your small actions can make a change. Maybe you won\u2019t change the world, but you might change one persons world, and that person just may have the ability to turn your ripple into a tsunami.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13592407_10153539638852047_2303095799080817242_n.jpg?oh=309c0ed6988db94789f6810b1b56471c&oe=58474F22\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13537780_1461002907259295_5427742891405442313_n.jpg?oh=7613fc157c66edfac27e6853446c69a8&oe=583DF2A7\n_National team, Kevin and I front & centre._\n\n## If you fancy a whirlwind tour of Australia, and a week that you will never forget.

It perfectly normal to wake up turn to other side and immediately fall asleep. That's not insomnia. It's the same story if you wake up to go to toilet or have a glass of water and subsequently fall asleep. However, if you wake up and can't fall asleep again for a long period of time, you actually might be suffering from insomnia.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth no. 2</strong> - A<em> good sleep is at least 8 hours a day.</em></p>\n<p>For kids a sleep is the most important part of their life. They sleep at least 8 hours or more. As a person is getting older his needs change. An adult need to sleep around 7 hours older people even less. We should have in mind that the need for sleep is very individual. Some people its is argued that its about 2% need to sleep only 4 hours a day, on the other hand some of us need at least 9. (See my other article how to sleep the most effective way: <a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@thiras/effective-sleep-how-to-do-it-less-is-more\">https://steemit.com/life/@thiras/effective-sleep-how-to-do-it-less-is-more)</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://sowhatfaith.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/long-life.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"319\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Myth no. 3 </strong>- <em>the more you sleep the longer life you have.</em></p>\n<p>This information is not correct. People who tends to sleep over 10 hours have generally shorter life then others. The reason behind such a long sleep might be a sleep apnea. It's a state when the patient does not breathe for a period up to 10 seconds, he subsequently realizes that and goes back to sleep. A fist signal might be snoring. Apnea is usually connected to cardiovascular problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth no. 4.</strong> - <em>Who likes to sleep tends to be fat.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>It is exactly the opposite, people who sleep a lot tends to be more fit, because during the sleep of adults the body tends to digest. Staying late and uneven distribution of sleep makes you feel more hungry. Shorter sleep also logically gives more time to eat :).</p>\n<p><strong>Myth no.5.</strong> -<em> Sleep more today and less tomorrow.</em></p>\n<p>It is not possible to sleep for the future. If you don't sleep during the week, you cannot make up for it during the weekend, period. Sleep deficit cannot be slept to. The more you will sleep the worse you will feel just wake up and go on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://unclutteredwhitespaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-12-at-11.51.59-AM.png\" width=\"631\" height=\"379\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Enough with myths what do I do wrong then?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>In the evening do not drink tea, coffee, coke or energy drinks (duh!). We all knows that caffeine helps to stay awake. How ever you might use coffee to conduct a power nap, wonder how to? See: <a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@thiras/reboot-your-brain-in-15-minutes-productivity-enchanted-power-nap\">https://steemit.com/life/@thiras/reboot-your-brain-in-15-minutes-productivity-enchanted-power-nap</a></li>\n  <li>Alcohol makes you fall asleep but the quality of sleep is generally worse, so try not to drink before going to sleep.</li>\n  <li>Do not eat hardly digestible plates 3 hours before going to sleep. &nbsp;Do not smoke. If you must smoke do not smoke at least an hour before going to sleep.</li>\n  <li>If you can get out for a while before sleeping do it. A short walk helps you tremendously.</li>\n  <li>Never work out 3-4 hours before sleep.</li>\n  <li>It will wake up your organism, work out in the morning.</li>\n  <li>Do not study, work, eat etc. in bed its mainly for sleep so leave that way.</li>\n  <li>Most importantly make a routine when you go to sleep and when you wake up, KEEP THAT ROUTINE. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</html>",

    "body": "http://www.bhmpics.com/thumbs/two_lions_sitting_at_rocks-t3.jpg\n\nMy last holiday experience with my husband before he passed away was very exciting and one I will cherish forever. \n\nWe went to Pilanesberg National Park. I could not imagine a better holiday than spending it with all my loved ones (five children and my husband). The only bit of sadness was that my daughter, her husband and my grandchild who lived in Australia was not able to join us.  \n\nWe spend our times in the evening\u2019s playing cards and talking around the fire and enjoying one another\u2019s company, listening to the animal sounds outside the camp and trying to identify which animal sound it is that we can hear. We decided to go for a game drive early the next morning. \n\nI love lions and every time we go to the national park, I pray that I would have the privilege of seeing a lion. A lion is so majestic; they are without any doubt the King of the jungle. They look so proud and handsome. \n\nWe woke up early at 4:30 and drove into the game reserve at 5:00 when the gates opened. It was a beautiful sunny morning and after seeing elephants, rhinos, giraffes, springbuck, kudus, blue wildebeest and impala, we decided to go to a big waterhole.\n \nhttp://www.karongweportfolio.com/Karongwe/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Lions-at-water-hole.jpg\n[Image Credit](www.karongweportfolio.com/Karongwe/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Lions-at-water-hole.jpg)\n\nBefore we even reached the turn off to the waterhole, we could see a lot of vehicles standing from afar. We passed a vehicle coming from the waterhole and Gawie stopped them to ask what was going on. They told us that there were two lions around the waterhole.  I felt the disappointment beating in my heart. Everyone will be watching the Lions, and they will disappear before I get to see them as there were probably about 50 cars waiting in a queue to look at them.\n \nAs we parked behind the last car, I could see the Lions in a distance walking next to the dam. We took a few photos, and then the lions moved away from the dam towards the veld. After about 5 minutes I became really excited as they were walking in our direction. I could not believe that my prayers were going to become true. They reached the road two cars ahead of us and then started walking down the road up to our vehicle. They passed in front of our vehicle, I was so excited and stopped taking photos, my heart was beating tremendously that I could see the King of The Jungle so close up.\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8e/6b/9b/8e6b9bc9484894e8b077b76069b05a00.jpg\n[Image Credit](s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8e/6b/9b/8e6b9bc9484894e8b077b76069b05a00.jpg)\n\nThen the adrenalin started pumping even faster when one of the lions walked past the front of the vehicle turned and walked along the side of our vehicle so close that if I stretched out my arm I could have touched him. I could see the yellow eyes looking at me, probably thinking hmm breakfast! The purring of his breath felt like it vibrated into my soul. I saw the rippling muscles as he strutted by. The strength in those paws, each as big as my head, is quite amazing.  He then turned around at the back of our vehicle and walked back to my window and then headed into the veld, where about 5m from our vehicle he again stood still, looked at us for about two minutes and then turned around and walked back to the dam.\n\nA Slight breeze brushed through my hair and the early morning wind cooled my flushed face, only then I realized that my window was open, that I never closed it because I was too fascinated by the King of the Jungle.\n \nThose cold, yellow eyes, that powerful purr, that magnificence which is Lion, will remain etched in my brain for eternity. \n\nInteresting facts about Lions.\n------------------------------\n\nThey are the most sociable of the cat species and bond together to protect the cubs of the pride and to hunt together. You can only find them in Africa and India. Their habitat are mostly savannah and grasslands, but some lions also like the bush and forest.  \n\nA pride of lions is normally not more than 15 and consists of related females, their cubs, and two to three males. \n\nThe female lions do the hunting, and they normally do it in groups stalking medium to large sized prey, examples are buffalo, wildebeest, zebra, and gemsbok. \n\nhttp://luxeadventuretraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Jdombs-Travels-Lion-SkySafari-4.jpg\n[Image Credit](luxeadventuretraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Jdombs-Travels-Lion-SkySafari-4.jpg)\n\nThe male lions then get to feast on their prey first while the cubs and the females look on. After the males have finished eating and are full, the cubs and females are allowed to eat the rest of the carcass.  \n\nThey sleep during the day and are then busy at twilight and into the night hunting their prey. Lions are territorial. They mark their area with urine and by roaring. The sound of a roar can carry 8km far. \n\nIf you would like to know more, I have added a link to a wonderful site:\nhttp://www.africa-wildlife-detective.com/african-lions.html\n\nhttp://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/ee/e8/6e/eee86e259ca02bd38fab00f4d2886e58.jpg\n[Image Credit](media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/ee/e8/6e/eee86e259ca02bd38fab00f4d2886e58.jpg)\n\n**Don't forget to follow @bubblefantasy!!** \n--------------------------------------- \n\n**@crazymumzysa features authors to promote new authors and a diversity of content.

    "body": "<h1>Hey Steemers!</h1>\n\nThis series aims to discuss and hopefully open discussion about potential persona conundrums many steemers might be experiencing.  There's been tremendous technological innovation with steem and it's innovative #blockchain features - We'll be focusing on one aspect of that innovation (the blogging, reward mechanics, and it's psychological impact on our many personas). This series aims to dive into what I call \"the steem persona conundrum\"  - A high level <em>steem specific</em> sociologically dive mainly at persona dynamics on the platform along with potential helpful guidance. \n\n<img src=\"https://s3.postimg.org/f0eyozgsj/logo.png\">\n\n<h2>The Conundrum</h2><img src=\"https://s3.postimg.org/gz9z5tu5v/Screen_Shot_2016_08_16_at_7_28_34_PM.png\">\n<em>Photo John Saddington</em>\n<p>As an author on steem you most likely at one point have asked yourself.. \"What kind of blogger am I?\".  The actual dilemma is your most likely articulating this type of Q&A with yourself over and over.  In fact this is probably something you ask yourself daily.  Remain focused on creating high value for everyone and clarity can come.  \n</p>\n<h2>Persona Chaos Theory</h2>\n<img src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/719rk4d59/image.jpg\">\n<br>\n<em>Image Source: Digital Times</em>\n<p>\nIt ultimately can be difficult to pick a theme for your posts. \n\n<strong>You are a multidimensional human being.  </strong> \n\nEducation, insight, guidance, support.. there's a lot to pick from. Bring the steem passion regardless of which direction you end up going.  It's been said writers are good because they talk about what they know - I say bring some passion to your content and turn Chaos into magic. \n</p>\n<h2>Chaos Magic</h2>\n<img src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/nde4vffel/Screen_Shot_2016_08_16_at_8_12_35_PM.png\">\n<br>\n<em>Image Source: Nomad Mag</em>\n<p>\nThe Chaos magic is in you.   Direct all the various directions the neurons in your brain are firing off and commit to the ones your passionate about.  Write them down.  Highlight the concepts that you feel most passionate about.  Commit to the list and dedicate yourself to them.  Rince and repeat.   How you handle complete goals in your life can be very similar how you focus on handling your Persona Conundrums. \n</p>\n\n<em>Future posts will cover handling your personas in more details - should you have multiple accounts? Could steem benefit programmatically with personal \"channel\" features?</em>\n\nMore coming soon! \n\n@originate",

    "body": "http://7063-presscdn-0-54.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Pickup-artist.jpg\n(www.selfstairway.com)\n\nAn attractive woman needs only dress the part and go to the venue of her choice, advertise her availability, and she will have any number of suitors buying her drinks, dropping cheesy lines, and trying to get her attention. Don\u2019t be one of those guys, lest you just become one minnow in a school of 1000\u2019s. Your efforts must focus in presenting yourself as a guy who is a different and refreshing alternative to the masses of beggars\u2026 \n\n# Don\u2019t Be Like Every Other Guy. Do anything to distinguish yourself.\nhttp://www.directexpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Shy-guy-in-bar.jpg\n(directexpose.com)\n\nSuppose you spot the most attractive woman in the room. Other men have been buying her drinks and begging for \u201ca chance\u201d... she\u2019s either rejecting the drink offers outright, or accepting them and possibly reciprocating with a little conversation (don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not getting anywhere with her). You know better though.\n\nRelax, take your time, and build a little tension first. Have a drink or two to take the edge off and boost your confidence. Position yourself and wait till you two have caught each other looking at one another a few times. If she\u2019s looked at you more than once, and particularly if you\u2019ve gotten a smile back, it's time to make your move\u2026 but you\u2019re not going to go over and offer to buy her a drink. That's what everyone else would do. \n\nYou\u2019re going to walk over and say something playful, funny, and most importantly *not* begging for attention. Something like \u201cAre you just going to stare at me all night or are you gonna buy me a drink?\u201d or \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you asked for my number yet?\u201d... Don\u2019t be afraid to rattle her a little. If her tag on her dress is flipping up and sticking out, jokingly point it out to her. Give her a hard time about whatever she\u2019s drinking or about how she should have been all over the last guy that you saw hit on her if you\u2019re witty and funny. If you pull it off with the proper light-hearted sense of humor, congrats, you\u2019ve got her attention now. Talk about whatever you want, but please no \u201cyou\u2019re so beautiful\u201d\u2019s.\n\n# Your Time and Attention Isn\u2019t Free. Make her work for it\nEvery other guy desires her and willingly gives his time and attention to her for free. She has no shortage of men\u2019s attention and is free to pick who she chooses. There is no excitement, fun or perceived value in having something which cost you nothing. If my time and attention is freely given then what value can it possibly have to her? \n\nTo the woman who has plenty of options in suitors you must communicate that she should value your time and attention. You must communicate that you have options beyond her and it is on her to compete for your attention. Is she with another female friend? Give her friend equal conversation and attention. She will realize there is competition about and you are of interest to other women, and you may realize you like the friend more anyway. \n\n# Don\u2019t state the obvious or compliment like everyone else\nUse compliments very sparingly. If you think someone may have told her it before then save that compliment for another time. When you do compliment, don\u2019t compliment her over things she has no control over. If she has the perfect cheek bones, or gorgeous blue eyes she already knows this and she didn\u2019t have control over it anyway. Say something pleasant about something she *does* control. Her hair style. Her shoes. Her taste in single malt scotch. Something that is uniquely her. \n\n# Don\u2019t talk about yourself unless asked a direct question\nFirst off, mysterious is attractive. Let her thoughts wander about who you are. If you tell her all about yourself without being asked one of two things happen. If you\u2019ve had a storied life that\u2019s impressive and you become a braggart, or it's not and you become boring. Better to ask her questions and let her talk about herself\u2026 everyone loves talking about yourself. So be generous and let her talk about herself to her hearts content.\n\n# Give the gift of missing you\nThis mantra applies as much when first meeting someone as it does in an established relationship. You\u2019ve gotten her attention and she\u2019s interested in you. Don\u2019t keep it going to the to the point she must excuse herself or leave the convo. You\u2019re a busy guy and you\u2019ve got other things to do is the idea you want her to have. Don\u2019t get boring. Don\u2019t let the conversation run out of steam. Always end the interaction leaving her wanting more.\n\n# The departure\nWe are talking about desirable women here so this won\u2019t be some one night stand. So if you want to see her again, you\u2019re gonna need to have a means of communication post-meet. Asking for her number though\u2026 that shifts the power to her and we don\u2019t want that, as silly as these games we play may be. It also sets you up for possible rejection. Give her *your* number and tell her to text you so you\u2019ve got it. Or give her your email and tell her with a laugh that you don\u2019t give your number out to strangers. \n\nPut the onus on her to contact you, or at least initiate it. Once again, you're being different and memorable, and you're communicating self confidence that she will. \n\n### Watch any love story of your choosing... watch it objectively and you'll see why the above advice works and conventional \"*wisdom*\" does not.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this article!

    "body": "https://i.imgsafe.org/5b6bd30021.jpg\n\nMy dad took a big step yesterday. Actually, he has taken multiple big steps in the best few months. I convinced him to move to Savannah, where I live, about 8 months ago. He was still living in the small, country town we both grew up in. I moved off 5 years ago for college. I graduated last November and have been working as a designer ever since. I was working for an awning company, as their personal graphic designer. It was a nice gig, but it wasn't going to be forever. My boss there informed me he was looking for an installer, someone to install the awnings after they were complete. Long story short, I got my dad an interview for the position and he got it! \n\nHe finally moved out of our small town and had a new job. Sadly, as we worked there longer and longer we started to slowly realize it was a terrible company. I won't go into details or names, but they were pretty much convicts. Luckily I got a job at the best design firm in Savannah and started work there about 6 weeks ago. I told my dad to tough it out and I would get him a job at the design firm. This week, he started as our wide format printer vinyl graphics technician! No more standing on top of ladders and drilling through concrete and steel for him! Did I mention that our new job just won Small Business of the Year in Savannah!? I have loved it here so far and my dad just started yesterday.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b54138c8f.jpg\n\nMy dad and I have done adhesive vinyl work on the side for a few years now, lettering vehicles , signs and store windows using a $400 machine purchased on Ebay. Boy that experience with that machine really paid off today. His first two jobs today required him to cut and weed vinyl. It was just like using the little machine and they were finished in just minutes. I think our boss may have been impressed. After work, I had a business meeting at the Social Club downtown, so my dad was able to tag along and have a Corona. \n\nThe meeting went well, I secured a new freelance job building a website and we made some new Crypto friends! Such a small world, these guys knew of Bitcoin and one of them claimed to have mined Litecoin a while back! They were cool guys and we introduced them to Steemit. They were blown away and could not wait to join and get started! One of the guys , Dillon, is a standup comedian and is going to wear a Steemit shirt at his next gig and post it! I think the community will get a nice kick out of it, he is a super funny guy.\n\nAfter the meeting, to celebrate the great things that happened that day, my dad and I tried a new restaurant in downtown Savannah. It was the Cafe Collin's Quarter Bar. Imagine West Village NYC meets Melbourne Australia with a dash of Southern Hospitality! A nice little place with some incredible food! Not to mention decent prices and fantastic service. Our waiter, Eli made the whole experience ten times better. We each enjoyed a nice glass of Californian red, Robin K. \"Cabernet\", seated at a window overlooking the historic Chippewa Square.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b541b3a49.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b543af12d.png\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b541e5a19.jpg\n\nI ordered the Big burger, it was delicious. (house ground brisket, brioche bun, cheese, spicy fries) \n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b542f2df5.jpg\n\nMy dad got the Pork Ribeye with a potato cake and seared veggies straight from the Chef's garden!\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b54344ce6.jpg\n\nToday was so good, let's just say my mouth is watering from typing this and we couldn't be more content after my dad's first day at a new job! I hope today is an indication of how well his new job is going to work out! It was just an awesome day. My dad took the risk of moving, starting two different new jobs and so far it seems like it was a great decision. Now we get to hang out after work and explore the town of Savannah together. Tonight we are going to see a concert after work!\n\n#steemit\n#food\n#adventure\n#news",

    "body": "> \"Your body cannot heal without play. Your mind cannot heal without laughter. Your soul cannot heal without joy.\" - Catherine Rippenger Fenwick\n\n## The Emotional Side Effects of Laughter \n\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/1zqwwb9.jpg\n\nLaughter helps you relax and recharge, reduce stress, increase energy, and help dissolve distressing emotions. Ever notice you don\u2019t feel anxious, angry, or sad when you\u2019re laughing? It's not possible to experience these emotions when laughing.\n\nAnd the best part? Laughter requires no instructions, it's free, it's fun, and it\u2019s priceless. Just like MasterCard :)\n\nShared laughter is even more powerful than laughing alone, it creates a positive bond that can strengthen relationships by triggering positive feelings. That bond then acts as a buffer against emotions such as stress, disagreements, and disappointment during difficult times. Humor also keeps relationships fresh and exciting, and is a powerful way to heal resentments and disagreements.\n\nIncorporating more laughter and play can improve the quality of your life, especially for your love relationships. Go to a comedy club, share a funny story, goof around with children or even go to [laughter yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter_yoga). Laughter gets you out of your head and away from your troubles, helps you forget judgments, criticisms, and doubts giving you a more enjoyable life.\n\n## Health Side Effects of Laughter\n\nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/wikb28.jpg\n\n**Blood pressure:** People who laugh on a regular basis tend to have a lower standing blood pressure. Blood pressure increases after a good laugh, but then it decreases to levels below normal.\n\n**Stress related hormones:** Epinephrine, cortisol, dopamine, and growth hormone are neuro-endocrine hormones associated with stress, these are all reduced after a healthy laugh.\n\n**Immunity**: According to clinical studies by Lee Berk at Loma Linda University laughter strengthens the immune system by increasing infection-fighting antibodies. Reference: American Journal of the Medical Sciences, vol.298 no.6, 1989.\n\n**Brain function:** Laughter enhances learning by stimulating both sides of the brain, which keeps the brain alert and allows for better retention of information.\n\n**Pain management**: In 1987, Texas Tech psychologist Rosemary Cogan used the discomfort of a pressure cuff to test the medical benefits of laughter on pain management. Participants who watched a 20-minute routine from comedian Lily Tomlin could tolerate a tighter cuff than those that watched an informational tape or none at all. It seems that laughter allows someone to \u201cforget\u201d about pains (to a degree) such as aches and arthritis. Reference: Journal of Behavioral Medicine. 10:139-144.\n\n**Respiration:** Like \u201cdeep-breathing\u201d laughter empties your lungs of more air than it takes in creating a cleansing effect, and sends more oxygen-enriched blood and nutrients throughout the body.\n\n**Heart health:** According to a [study](http://www.wellnessresources.com/studies/laughter_improves_blood_flow) by the University of Maryland Medical Center laughter helps blood flow by creating a 30% - 50% expansion of blood vessels. These blood vessels are your front line in determining the health of your arteries. When constricted blood pressure rises and inflammation induces damage, setting the stage for plaque accumulation. Also, it was found that people without heart disease are 40% more likely to laugh than those with heart disease (tested in a variety of situations).\n\n**A great workout:** William Fry, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at Stanford University believes that one minute of laughter is equal to ten minutes on the rowing machine. Equivalent to \u201cinternal jogging\u201d laughter can provide an abdominal, facial, and back muscle conditioning effect, great for people that cannot perform physical exercise.\n\nStudies also show that an atmosphere of humor results in better patient care and shorter hospital stays.\n\n## Other Interesting Laughter Facts\n\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/rs5z7n.jpg\n\nWe start laughing as babies at about the age of 4 months, as children we laugh an average of 300 times a day, and then it decreases to an average of 17 times a day as an adult. It seems we laugh less as we age, because adults between the ages of 18 to 34 report laughing the most.\n\nThere\u2019s also a difference in how we laugh, according to men it\u2019s a chuckle most of the time, whereas for women it\u2019s more of the giggling type of laugh most of the time.\n\nMost of the laughter we experience comes from spending time with friends, co-workers and family, in groups, not from hearing jokes. Maybe this is because laughter can be contagious.\n\nLaughter can also make you more attractive to the opposite sex, and it\u2019s speculated that it might help inhibit the fight or flight response, making it a behavioral sign of trust. In other words, make that potential mate laugh and they\u2019ll be less likely to run away :)\n\nBecause the sound of laughter is so common and familiar some researchers believe it may have helped our ancestors bond. In fact, the sound can even be recognized if played backwards.\n\nFor some funny jokes visit:\nhttp://www.laughfactory.com/jokes\n\nMay you day be filled with health giving laughter.",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>When I broke up with my girlfriend last year, she moved out and I stayed in the flat we had shared for two years.</p>\n<p>We didn't have any kids. But we had three (3!) cats and a patio full of plants. She took the cats and I got the plants.</p>\n<p>I had never been very fond of those plants. First of all, because they were not ours. They are the plants of our landlord. They simply left it there for us to take care and I considered these as intruders and as a burden. My girlfriend didn't see them that way.</p>\n<p>I think my feeling comes from my childhood. I grew up in a big house, surrounded by three big lawns. As soon as I was in age to help my father, I was enlisted to mow the lawns... And I hated it. And I promised myself I would have a house without any plant, without any lawn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Go figure...</p>\n<p>So now, 15 years later, here I am, in a flat with a patio which looks like a green jungle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My first decision, as soon as my ex-girlfriend had moved out, was to move all the plants out of the flat and to send them where they belonged: in the patio. I guess this decision was made because the invasion of plants was all her decision. I had no say in it. I just accepted it tacitly, without enthusiasm, but without complaints, in order to avoid a conflict.</p>\n<p>However, one plant got away from my drastic measure: it was a kind of ivy plant, and, I don't know why, I found it added something to the bathroom. Or maybe the humidity in the bathroom made it very easy to sustain and take care of. So I left it there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/9412fv139/IMG_20160826_200921.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>Months passed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each day, going and coming back from work, I passed by my patio and barely gave a thought to it. Nothing more than \"tomorrow I will water it\" or \"I should really clean it next week\". But I did nothing. Because I had never done anything o. I helped my ex when she asked me to, but I had never taken any intiative.</p>\n<p>I did not even notice that some plants were slowly dying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At least, the plant in my bathroom was thriving. After 6 months, it was still going stronger and greener. I discovered that I was proud of it. I discovered that I spent more and more time every week looking at it and watering it.</p>\n<p>It was a kind of guilty pleasure to see it when I came out of the shower and to see its lush green. It felt like a friend, a companion.</p>\n<p>But then something happened. And it started to decay (I blame the fertilizer which I had bought). It just died and my bathroom never looked so empty and dull and white.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I realized that I missed this plant.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I went to my patio, looking for a replacement.</p>\n<p>But I didn't look what I saw : it was too late for quite a lot of plants. By lack of water, or lack of care, some were beyong any help. They were dry and dead and all was left was to throw them away.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A few others were in the last throes. I made sure to water them at regular intervals. It became a routine.</p>\n<p>Some have been saved, some were beyond saving, but my patio has come back from the brink of desertification.</p>\n<p>And I kind of like it.</p>\n<p>I would not have thought it possible to like gardening, but I realize now why people love plants. I realize how plants can help overcome the daily grind of life or help get over difficulties, like breakups.</p>\n<p>Plants can be more than decoration. Plants can be friends, familiar faces which welcome and greet you, friends you care for and you devote yourself to.</p>\n<p>I'm now trying to reconstruct my little patio. As you can see below, the aloe vera is still going stroing and some plants have grown some new leaves, with a brighter shade of green :&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/g29rzjolh/IMG_20160826_201136.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/lmm9a6ngl/IMG_20160826_201056.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/86z8kqeyt/IMG_20160826_201101.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I found it quite comforting to see that I could bring back from the dead some flowers and some plants which looked like dead, like the one right above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I found some wild species of palms and transplanted it into pots left vacant in my patio. I monitor them carefully. For the moment they look like the jaws of thin spotted lizards :&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/ofavggyf9/IMG_20160826_201029.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>As for my bathroom, I transplanted another kind of ivy into the same pot. It will take time for it to grow to the same size as my previous friend, but i know that if i'm conscientious and careful and regular enough, I will soon have a new plant to light up my bathroom and my mornings :&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/5vwl2teth/IMG_20160826_200856.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>That's all I needed to say. Sometimes you must listen to all the lessons life has to offer, how modest they are. I listened.</p>\n</html>",

We think what we want and when we want ? Wait , do not rush to answer . Think thought , think about what you think and how to think . Someone may ask : \" I am free of my mind , my thoughts submit to my will .\" . It will be ? \n\nThe French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre defended one of the smartest theses of philosophy: man is condemned to be free. Sartre was right or was naively romantic to defend this thesis? Are we free of ourselves?\n\nIf we look at the external behavior, there is no doubt that Sartre was right. An inmate may have his body confined behind bars, but your mind is free to think, fantasize, to dream, to imagine. If your self is not trained to reflect on your mistakes, the punishment will not be in any way educational. On the contrary, phenomena that build thoughts chains will make a multi-focal reading memory over days, months and years, building mental images of escape tunnels, shortening of the sentence; in short, everything to escape a worse prison than the physical prison: the prison of anguish, boredom, the stifling anxiety. Who built prisons throughout history did not study the process of building thoughts, did not understand that the mind can never be imprisoned.\n\nWhy dictators, however brutal they are, no matter how much control their people with an iron hand, fall? Because no one can control the movement of the self and its desires for freedom.\n\nA baby will want to leave the mother's arms to explore the environment. A teenager will risk making new friends, even if it is shy. A person marked by a phobia departs from the phobic object; finally, will meet his freedom. From this angle, Sartre was exactly right: man is condemned to be free.\n\nHis thesis founded, including civil rights and duties of citizens in democratic societies. In them, we have the freedom to express our thoughts to come and go. But if, on the one hand, we yearn desperately to be free, secondly, to observe closely the process of building thoughts and sophisticated traps within it, we see that Sartre's thesis is naive and romantic. Unfortunately, we are not free as we would like to be in the intellect of the heart. In fact, the worst prisons, the worst dungeons, the tightest handcuffs may be within us. Let's see.\n\n<b>The Self is hostage to a database</b>\n\nWe build thoughts from the body of information filed in our memory. All ideas, creativity and imagination are born of marriage between a stimulus and the reading of the memory, which operates in thousandths seconds. The I not aware that reading and organization of data at high speed that occurs in the mind scenes, only the final product staged on the stage, that is, thoughts already developed.\n\nA frame, the characters of the movie or a book, however unusual they are, was gestated based on the reading of elements contained in the author memory. And memory is a product of our genetic makeup, the mother's womb, the social environment, the educational environment and the relationships of our self with the mind itself.\n\nThousands of experiences that are part of our early childhood database, such as rejections, losses, setbacks, fears were produced without that we could control them, filter them, reject them. Of course today, as adults, we make choices, take actions, but our choices are guided by the database we already have, and therefore our freedom is not full as Sartre thought.\n\nA man who may be the greatest educator of history, saw this limitation clear and haunting way. When he was dying on the cross for more than 2000 years, he said something surprising: \"Father, forgive them, they do not know what they do.\" A nonreligious analysis, but psychological and sociological, shows that the statement carries an unprecedented altruism. But at the same time, it seems unacceptable his attitudes to protect the executioners.\n\nThe Roman soldiers knew what they were doing, fulfilled the damning piece of Pilate. However, for the master of masters, the thoughts that they were built on the one hand, the result of free choice, and secondly, the basis of hostage data from your memory, tyrannical culture of the Roman Empire. Fulfilled orders, were not completely autonomous or the owners own destiny. They were prisoners of their past, \"slaves\" of their culture.\n\nCulture is the foundation for the identity of a people, but if it prevents us from putting ourselves in the other and think before reacting, it is enslaving. For the master of Galilee, behind a person who hurts, there is always an injured person. This does not solve the problem of their opponents, but solved his problem. Protect his mind. I did not carry his follies and aggressiveness that does not belong to him. The tolerance relieved, even when the world collapsed on him.\n\n\n<b>The I may be overwhelmed by the phenomenon auto-flux</b>\n\nWe do not cease to be free just because we are prisoners of our past, \"freedom limited to an existential story.\" Even within this database, we do not have full freedom of choice, as Sartre thought.\n\nImagine that we have millions of \"bricks\" in our memory, which arise from the gene pool, the relationship with parents, siblings, friends, experiences at school, information books, the process of introspection. There is no doubt that we have freedom of choice to use these bricks and build emotions and thoughts at the pleasure of the self, thoughts accusing, speeches, analyze, welcome, criticize, accept, love, hate.\n\nUnless someone is in psychotic break or under intense effect of a drug, or an unfit child to be aware of their actions, the exercise to choose and use the memory bricks are preserved. But despite the freedom that I have to access and use information to build chains of thoughts under their responsibility, there are unconscious phenomena that build thoughts and emotions without your permission. If these phenomena do exist, it dramatically changes our understanding of who we are, Homo sapiens.\n\nYou enter an aircraft knowing that there is a terrorist on board who could master the pilot and the plane to plummet? I asked this question to an audience of doctors. Of course, all said no. Then I asked, \"Who likes to suffer, to grieve?\". Fortunately, there was no present masochist. I continued, \"Who suffers in advance?\". Almost everyone in the audience demonstrated. Then I explained that if we regard the human mind as the most complex aircraft and the pilot, I, mental aircraft of them would be in free fall. I told them that \"if I you is not a masochist, if no one hates or seeks to mutilate, why then suffer in advance? If it is not I that produces these disturbing thoughts, those who produce them? The conclusion is that there is a 'terrorist' on board, there is a copilot sabotaging mental aircraft. \"\n\nWho is this copilot? I call auto-flux. Later, we will investigate it in detail, but in advance I say that such unconscious phenomenon is of vital importance to the human psyche, for creativity and for the pleasure of living, but may lose its healthy function and pass to terrify us. In fact, he is largely responsible for producing the Accelerated Thought Syndrome.\n\nDoctors began, finally, to understand that the thesis of Jean-Paul Sartre did not hold. Our Self is free to think, to organize the data in your memory, but at the same time, there are unconscious phenomena, which until then had not been studied by other theorists, producing thoughts without the authorization of the Self and that can sabotage it does, enslave him, imprison him.\n\n\nWe can not say that we are condemned to be free. We are not alone in mental aircraft ... We can and should be educated to be authors of our history, but this freedom is won and has its limits. The history of humanity, with its many injustices and atrocities, is a clear example of this.\n\n<b>The RAM phenomenon dominates memory and the I.</b>\n\nThe third element of questioning Sartre's thesis is linked to the limitations of the self as the archive memory. In computers, we are gods, we record what we want and when we want, but in human memory that is impossible. The record of all we contact is automatic and involuntary, produced by an unconscious phenomenon called Automatic Memory Register (RAM).\n\nNot just what our I want to be archived, but also what he hates and despises. All that most hate or reject will be recorded with greater power, forming traumatic windows, I call killer. If you hate someone, make sure he will sleep with you and spoil your sleep. So if I, which is the ability to choose, is not free to avoid the registration of our disturbing thoughts and stressful stimuli that we cover, how can we say that man is condemned to be free?\n\nStudy and understand these unconscious phenomena not just leave us stunned, but will also lead to a new understanding of the science of education, psychology, psychiatry, sociology and sociopolitical relations.\n\nThe process of building thoughts and all its psychological and sociological implications have not been systematically studied by brilliant thinkers as Freud, Jung, Roger Skinner, Piaget, Vygotsky, Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Hegel, Kant, Descartes, among others.\n\nThe great theoreticians of psychology and philosophy have used the thinking ready to produce, with brilliance, knowledge about the process of personality formation, the learning process, ethics, sociopolitical relations, but little investigated one that can be considered the last frontier science: the very thought.\n\nOver more than three decades, thoroughly studied this area and developed the theory of Multifocal Intelligence. I thought day and night, year after year, analyzing and writing about the nature, types, limits and the process of building thoughts.\n\nThis trajectory not leveraged my pride; instead, put me in touch with my ills and my smallness, because it made me realize in psychotherapy sessions and psychiatric consultations, all patients were as complex as the most cultured and rational human beings. Study the dynamics, the construction and movement of fully thoughts left me convinced that each patient, more fragmented that was his personality, had the same dignity as me.\n\nWe have the custom to qualify in black and white, rich and miserable, celebrities and anonymous, intellectuals and illiterates, kings and subjects, because we stand on the surface of the psychic world, because we know no more than the anteroom of the phenomena that weave us as Homo sapiens. We are a sick kind that little has honored the art of thinking.\n\nThe fact that the most complex of all phenomena of intellect, thought to have been very little investigation brought very serious consequences for the development of our species. Thinking thinking systematically leads us to break the prison of our truths and opens a universe of possibilities to understand who we are. And also to understand that the construction edit thought a high frequency leads to the evil of the century, an unprecedented brain wear.\n\n<b>Einstein's error and other consequences</b>\n\nFor not having studied the process of building thoughts, their types and their nature not developed tools for the I be a psychic manager, which led to some distressing paradoxes. Let's see. We are at the height of medicine and psychiatry, but have never been so sick.\n\nA recent study of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan shows that, over a lifetime, one in two people should develop a psychiatric disorder, ie, more than 3 billion people. We are in the leisure industry's heyday, but there has never been a generation so sad and depressed like ours. We are in the era of knowledge, information democratization, but never produce so many repeaters of information rather than thinkers.\n\nAnd the paradoxes do not stop there. For not having investigated the fundamental phenomenon that makes us thinking beings, we experience today blunders and very serious sustainability of human relations, including social inclusion. What is the difference between a person psychotic break and an intellectual?\n\nThere were differences between the great Einstein and the psychotic son he interned in a mental hospital and never visited? There were some differences in the thinking organization, the parameters of reality, in the depth of the ideas in the imagination of the formatting, but behind the scenes of the mind, they were exactly the same.\n\nEinstein's son could build illogical thoughts and mental images disconnected from reality, but the performance of self and the unconscious phenomena that built these thoughts and images was exactly the same as Einstein used to produce a sophisticated theory of relativity. Redeem a verb out of billions of options and use it in a chain of thought, even illogical, equivalent to shoot the moon and hit a fly.\n\nThe very rapid reading of memory and use of data that financed the bizarre characters and persecutory ideas Einstein's son, I repeat, not far were less complex than those of his father. However, the gloomy environment of a mental hospital, the difficulties of dealing with the child's reasoning without logical parameters and Einstein's impotence feeling led the man who most met the forces of the physical universe to be suffocated by the forces of a more complex universe, the psychic.\n\nWhen we study the process of building thoughts, we are enlightened to understand that madness and rationality are closer to each other than we think. Therefore, an intelligent person never discriminate or decreases others.",

    "body": "<center>http://cartoon-characters.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Top-Cat-Gang.jpg</center>\n\nAs a kid under communist Romania, *TV was not a big thing for me*. The sets were bad, there were only a few hours a day of programming and it was mostly propaganda anyway. Romania was generally worse than other countries in this respect, and people closer to the border got special antennas to catch Bulgarian stations.\n\n\nLike all kids I liked cartoons, and it was a great tragedy in my young mind when my parents picked me up from kindergarten in the middle of the *only daily cartoon shown* \u2013 if I remember correctly something with a girl call Heidi, and I frequently missed the ending of the episode. Also there was something Russian with a wolf and rabbit. We had a VCR and a couple of cassettes with cartoons which I must have seen *100 times.*\n\n<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c4/Nu_pogodi_by_vjacheslav_kotenochkin.jpg</center>\n<center>BC: Before Cartoon Network</center>\n\nAfter communism ended, things did not change instantly. But one day, coming back from school, I entered the house and noticed an unfamiliar large, black shape - **a brand new TV set**, a Panasonic, and maybe nothing special by most standards of the time, but it was AMAZING for me. And it had cable. With **Cartoon Network**. It quite blew my mind. Cartoons, all sorts, all day. As long as my parents allowed watching that is.\n \nThe first cartoon I watched was *Birdman*, followed by everything else shown on Cartoon Network in the early 90s. Everything. There was still some drama. My parents watched the nightly news on the TV, right when **Top Cat** was on, which I loved as a kid. And I learned a lot of English watching Top Cat and the gang \u2013 unlike the Tom & Jerry cartoons on my VCR tapes.\n\n<center>http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/cartoonnetwork/images/c/ca/Birdman_energy_shield.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130627015218</center>\n\nYou see, *there was no dubbing or subtitles*. I had some knowledge of English \u2013 my parents got me a tutor in first grade that actually taught me a lot, and there was some in school. I still didn\u2019t understand everything. But I didn\u2019t need to. Just having cartoons was so great, nothing else mattered. And I watched and I watched.  \n\nAnd slowly, I started understanding more and more. Episodes tended to repeat on Cartoon Network, but for me it was quit alright, I liked them and I understood better as each month passed. Each and every episode *more words made sens, more phrases*. This is important, as phrases often have cultural meaning and just knowing what the words mean is not enough.  *Sticks and stones* does not mean stick and stones, *paying the piper* does not involve singers and currency. I was not alone in that. A lot of Romanian kids were like me. And it led to pretty good English for my generation.\n\nIt was a pretty organic form of learning, and it had a good effect on verbal skills. Sure we learned English and French grammar in schools, but for many knowing words and rules is easy, using them fluently in conversation is not. When you know a language, conversation flows, you do not need to think of the rules. I was never fluent in French, though I learned words and verbs and conjugation. They just didn\u2019t come together when I needed them. In English, on the other hand, I never really thought of the rules. If it sounded right, it probably was.\n\nI am the same with my native Romanian. I am not sure I can name all the rules and grammar; I did not learn the language by rules. I learned by hearing and talking. And the same applies in English, which helped a lot.\n\n<center>http://swatkats.info/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/02/swat-kats.jpg</center>\n<center>The cool stuff </center>\n\nMy generation talked a lot in what we called *romglish*, Romanian peppered with English words. There were nationalist politicians that wanted to ban English words in advertising, to somehow *preserve the purity of the language*. Hell, there still are in several countries. But, for us, in a country with a native language that is, to be frank, useless internationally, learning English was a huge help. Most of people my age use it daily in their work; use it on vacation or watching movies, reading books not translated in Romanian, and more. And many of us hold a debt of gratitude to Cartoon Network.\n\nCartoon Network is dubbed these days. I can understand why, but I still think it is a damn shame. Kids these days take cartoons for granted and maybe do not have the patience to watch a language they do not understand. Or maybe they do, if they were left at it, but the parents try too hard to make it easy on them. Who knows? Off course with internet, they have ample opportunity to learn English. But as they still spend the time to watch cartoons, wouldn\u2019t hurt to have some extra practice, hearing the language young and trying to understand. A bit of struggle grasping it might even help. Who knows?\n\nPoint is, they don\u2019t make em like they used to. And they are badly dubbed, which takes half the fun away.",

    "body": "<html>\n<blockquote>Yuri Gagarin is no longer with us.</blockquote>\n<p>A phone call summoned me to the press room in the middle of the night. I could tell by the editor's voice that it was something bad. I rushed out to my car, then hurried up the stairs and along the deserted corridor. The presses were still, but everyone who had been on duty that night had stayed on. The editor was speaking on the phone.</p>\n<blockquote>\"No. There's no hope. He was killed,\" he said and hung up.</blockquote>\n<p>How? Where? What had happened? Perhaps it was all a mistake? We sat around in silence, staring dully at the big clock, watching the movement of the large black hands. I heard the news again over the car radio that morning. It was news one simply did not want to believe.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/n6x0q7v6x/remember_gagarin.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p>I first heard the name Gagarin seven years before as I was driving along one morning. People were standing around in groups on the street. Some of them asked me to stop and open the car door so that they could hear the broadcast. What exactly had that young man from Gzhatsk done? Then it was ten o'clock of another spring morning, and the name coming over the radio was the same: Yuri Gagarin. Again I was asked to stop my car and turn the volume up. And the same questions were asked: What? Where? How had it happened?</p>\n<p>People all over learned that Yuri Gagarin was dead. Everyone knows that life does not only consist of good news. But Gagarin ... It was impossible.</p>\n<p>The piles of telegrams in the press room were growing. The music coming over the air wrenched your heart, while the sparrows fluttering in the puddles and the starlings singing seemed jarringly out of place. There is not a home in the country in which the people did not heave a sigh or shed a tear. The man who is no longer with us was a part of something very big that unites us all.</p>\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/u6inf5nev/leonov.jpg\"></div>\n<p>He was a Russian, and every Russian was proud, seeing in him the finest traits of his nation. Yet, he was the son of all people, of Georgians, Latvians, Frenchmen, Arabs and Uzbeks. All were equally proud of him, because he was a Man and thus represented all of mankind in its first step into the unknown. We who live in the USSR had a right to be doubly proud, for he was a Soviet man, the embodiment of the best qualities of a Soviet person. The world, as it looked into his face, actually had a good look at all Soviet people. That meant it gained a better understanding of us all. His smile expressed the spirit of his people. His cause was the cause of his people. That was why Gagarin's name captivated the world so quickly, and that is why there is not a single home on Earth where the sorrow of our loss is not shared today.</p>\n<p>So much has been said about the cause to which he devoted his life that there is no need to repeat the events of his starry hour that morning of April 12, 1961, nor of what has become possible and understandable, too, as a result. Ships ply the Atlantic. So much of importance has happened on these perilous sea routes in the last five hundred years. Yet, when we speak of America we first recall Columbus, the discoverer of the New World. Gagarin's place in history will be the same. People will become accustomed to his name appearing together with those of Columbus and Magellan.</p>\n<p>We shall name new streets in his honor, we shall probably name a city after him, and it will be worthy of his name. We shall erect a monument to him made of the most lasting metals, this for the people of tomorrow. But only yesterday we still knew Yuri Gagarin, the living man. We knew his manner of speaking, his smile. Someone had seen him pulling on his flying helmet for the last time before climbing into the cockpit. His wife remembers his last words to her. Someone received a letter from him yesterday, while another might still be in the mails.</p>\n<p>He was a good man. I saw him on numerous occasions and was friendly with him. I recall the trim major running down the wooden staircase in the house on the bank of the Volga the day after his spaceship landed. I recall the joy and surprise on the major's face as he looked at the first pictures in the newspapers.</p>\n<p>Seven years of fame did not change Gagarin. Many did not suspect the hard lot that had fallen to him. There was his work, his family, his studies and being always in the limelight. There was the insatiable interest people took in him and which was so often exhausting. Gagarin carried this weight honorably and with dignity, as a true man and a Communist. He could not always reply to all requests in the affirmative. He often had to say \"no\" to us newspapermen, too, but he always did this tactfully and kindly. He could speak equally well to the Queen of England and to an old peasant woman who, I recall, recognized him on the road near Yaroslavl and came over, crossing herself, \"<em>to have a look at Gagarin</em>\". His winning smile of a good-natured Russian man was a great aid to him. In watching him I could never help wondering at the wisdom of the choice that had been made in April 1961.</p>\n<p>Another reason we all feel so close to Gagarin is that in the thirty-odd years of his life we shared a common lot. This meant a childhood of meager rations, patched clothes and studying by the light of a kerosene lamp, and growing up in the postwar years, when young Komsomol members led a busy and exciting life, helping to rebuild the war-ravaged country. This meant a maturity in which one's convictions made a man a Communist. Gagarin was one of us. This explains the sincerity of our love for him and the sincerity of our grief as we stand with bared heads at his grave.</p>\n<p>He died in a plane crash. He who had braved the risk and danger of a space flight seven years ago returned to the earth unscathed. What, then, could possibly happen to him on the ground or even a bit higher? This was what so many probably thought and what Gagarin himself probably thought. Perhaps that is why we feel somehow guilty today. Could we have in some way prevented his death? Then again, knowing that a person can be killed on an icy street, which of us will stay at home on a frosty day? You can't fence yourself in. A man cannot let himself be swathed in the cotton of overprotection, no matter how precious his life may be to others. Gagarin, above all, did not want to change his ways, and this could not be disregarded. He was constantly in the air and spoke of new flights. Had anyone the right to forbid him this?</p>\n<p>Our loss is great. Yet, as in time of war the death of our comrades added new strength to the survivors, today our grief will not stop our forward movement.</p>\n<h2>And may the fine name YURI GAGARIN shine on forever, serving as an example to us always.</h2>\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><hr><strong><a href=\"https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@peskov/lenin-prize-awarded-writer-journalist-photographer-traveller-and-ecologist-vasily-peskov-a-soviet-journalist-s-travels\">Vasily Peskov</a></strong></div>\n</html>",

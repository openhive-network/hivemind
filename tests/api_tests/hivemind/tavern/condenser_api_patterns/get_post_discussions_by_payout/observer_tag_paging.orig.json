    "body": "![](https://i.imgur.com/TxdFMNa.png)\n\nI has been living in Moscow about 5 years. I live in a midsized apartment in the center of Moscow with a view on a thoroughfare. Life around me is just bustling: people are hurrying up somewhere; the all kinds of sounds drown out each other. There are a lot of cars a wide variety of brands. Yes, Moscow never sleeps. The sights and masterpieces of architecture in Moscow are breathtaking too: Kremlin, Red Square, Tretyakov Gallery, Armouries, St. Basil\u2019s Church and so on. I\u2019m a beginner developer. I hope that Moscow will help me to achieve my goals and I believe in my success. Anyway, I\u2019m happy right now. \n\nAtmosphere\n===\n----\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a9AGU4f.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/czysqK6.jpg)\n\n\nMoscow is a great huge city full of life the whole day and whole night. There\u2019re many sufficient people, many huge main offices of well-known companies, new different buildings and skyscrapers. All these are just incredible. However, there\u2019s too much vanity in Moscow because it\u2019s a huge city. You feel yourself alone in this megapolis. Grey sky, people who always hurry up somewhere, road traffics and many factors like these makes the atmosphere in Moscow grey, lonely and too vanity in some of your days. Not everyone will be able to live in this city. \n\nPeople\n===\n----\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nCNR7Mo.png)\n\nI know one interesting fact about people from Moscow. Many people came here because they has wanted to make a career or to get married. Thus, people on the streets always hurry up on their business. It\u2019s a rare fact when someone decide to stop and show you the right road with a smile on his face like in New-York, for example. People rather meet each over in the places like metro, park, bus stop or even cinema. Moscow is a lonely place, there\u2019s no rally crowd in this city, However, if you find friends or just good acquaintances between your colleagues or something like that they will be you really good friends at this \u00abOn one\u2019s Jack\u00bb city. \n\nOpportunities\n===\n----\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VDSJoSc.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/F1Agbxb.png)\n\n\nMany people come to Moscow because they believe they can realize their dreams in this place. Well, many of them really get successful after some time. Some of them are not get successful and they are often unhappy. Anyway, that\u2019s true that there\u2019re a lot of different opportunities in Moscow. You just should already have some experience to be further than others. Maybe Moscow so fast and crowded because of this fact. \n\n<em>@kental with you!\n\n\n<em><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kental\">Follow me!!!!</a> </em>",

Can't lose those few extra pounds?\n\n**Need some more excuses to add to your list?**\n\nWithout further adieu, the **ULTIMATE** list of **VALID EXCUSES**. \n\nNo. Really.\n\nI have a full time job, three kids, two dogs, and a cat.. I don't have enough time to work on my idea.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have student debt to pay off, there is **no way** I can afford to work on my business on the side.\n\nI'm **not qualified** for the job that I know I'm perfect for... Might as well not even **try.**\n\nThe last guy I asked out **rejected me.**. At least Netflix **doesn't judge.**\n\nMy parents were **both overweight**, which means I'll always struggle with my own body issues.\n\nI didn't go to a great college, so there's no way I'll be hired to work at an awesome startup.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI was born skinny, no workout plan will help me gain some muscle.\n\nI tried my last business idea and it **failed miserably..** now my parents won't even talk to me.\n\nAll my friends grew up never having to worry about money.. **they don't understand what it's like to be me.**\n\nMy family and friends are *so negative..* and there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nI'll work on my project at later this year. It will be better timing.\n\nI made a few huge mistakes early on in my career, and now I'm destined for mediocrity.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI want to learn how to draw, but art supplies are **too expensive.**\n\nI really want to learn Spanish, but learning a new language **as an adult is impossible.**\n\nI would really like to start a podcast, but **I don't know how.**\n\nI bought a course on entrepreneurship, but it was a scam so I didn't follow through.\n\nI'm an introvert, so I can't go learn how to \"network.\"\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nI don't have enough time! All the successful people I know have money to hire a virtual assistant.\n\nMy job sucks, so I'm super tired after work -- Madden is **my time to unwind.**\n\nI had a really bad childhood, **everyone is out to get me.**\n\nI have **really** bad anxiety.. I can't possibly ask for a raise.\n\nI did everything I could! I don't know why I didn't get promoted.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEveryone seems to take advantage of me. Why should I even try?\n\nI hosted an event at college on how to manage personal finances. No one showed up.\n\nMy first few jobs **were all failures**. Will I ever find the job that is right for me?\n\nI want to work on my online business, but Twitter and FB keep sending me notifications.\n\nI can't afford to eat healthy, McDonalds is on my way home.\n\nMy mum, father, brother, sister, say I should be a lawyer... I guess that means that's my destiny.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI wrote a blog post, but no one read it. I must be a terrible writer.\n\nNo one understands my situation... **I'm stuck and always will be.**\n\nI want to make money online, but everyone who does is a scammer!\n\nI've been wanting to change careers for years now, but I'm 40 and it's far too late for that.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI read a few books in highschool and hated it. No book appeals to me.\n\nI'm so afraid of coming up short! **What will my family and friends think?**\n\nI raised money for my last startup and it failed... Now investors won't return my calls.\n\nI had to settle for a job that I hate, because my wife and children are depending on me.\n\nI am **TERRIBLE** at math! I'll never be able to learn calculus.\n\nAll my friends went to an amazing school. I'm destined to be a loser.\n\nThere's so much I want to learn! But I don't have the time or money to do so.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy last girlfriend broke up with me out of the blue... I'll **never** be able to find love like that again.\n\nMy entire family loves political party x.. but I disagree with them! We'll never be able to get along.\n\nMy friend said I was wasting my talents.. **I just want to give up.**\n\nI'm in a shitty relationship, and I don't know what to do.\n\nI was a jerk to my friend, and now they won't talk to me.\n\nMy super successful coworker has always been good with people! I'll never be able to be like him.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm always shy in group situations.. no matter what I try.. I can never be good with people.\n\nMy friend has a fitbit! **I'm so jealous**! No wonder she is able to stay in such good shape.\n\nMy uncle lied to me when I was young! I can't trust anyone anymore!\n\nI don't understand FB. **My online business is doomed.**\n\nMy teacher said I would never be a good writer. I became a lawyer instead.\n\nI tried a new exercise routine for 3 days and it didn't work.\n\nEating healthy is so boring!\n----------------------------\n\nI don't **know how** to start a website!!\n\nMy significant other thinks my business idea is stupid. I guess I should stay at my job.\n\nI have **ADD..** there's no way I can ever focus long enough to succeed.\n\n.....\n.........\n.....\n.........\n\nValid? Yes.\n-----------\n\nWe've all listened to the abundance of excuses living inside our head.\n\nBut your health, happiness, and future success depends on your ability to ignore.\n\nWhat's your excuse? Good. \n\nYou're human.\n\nNow go and make things happen anyway.\n\n**P.S** Would love to hear what 'excuses' are holding you back?

    "body": "In the study of sociology and psychology, people have studied the behaviors of people. The amazing fact is that, for all of the data, studies and surveys the experts have done over the years, have done nothing to come up with solutions for people\u2019s inaccurate ways of thinking. Looking at how people behave socially today is not much different than our ancestors conducted themselves socially during their lives. \n\nThere are three topics or ways of thinking in this writing that grabbed my attention the most, my guess is that I have experienced them at past times in my life, today even in the present and as I hope to improve myself as a person, I will probably experience the same three in the future so I can only plan on how I can pass in the positives in everyday social interaction. This way, we can treat people who may look different or speak differently than us the same as we would treat our own brother. That we will be honest in our behaviors with people and not adopt lying as a lifestyle, and finally to be followers to just leadership but to also take the step to be leaders ourselves. \n\n# **We just want people around us to be alike, and assume they\u2019re bad if they aren't:**\n\n<center>https://scottwoodsmakeslists.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/blackmanwhat.jpg</center>\n\n**Image Source: [ScottWoodsMakesLists](https://scottwoodsmakeslists.wordpress.com)**\n\nI truly believe this has gone on since people were scattered into different groups and at the day humans were divided by language. Over many centuries, physical features like skin color, eye color, and hair type brought more uniqueness in the human family but also more division. Over time, those groups with those unique features formed cultures which contained, their own language, style of clothing, education, religion, foods, and traditions. \n\nYet beneath all of those differences, we were still one big family descended from the first man and woman. Sadly, there were those who see people who may look different, speak different, dress different as being inferior. Those were the ones the supposed superior group would who look down on with fear and hate of the other groups of people because they were different.\n\nThe best example of this was the slave trade. I can say that The United States was the country and its culture for the most part from the 17th through the middle part of the 19th century accepted the enslavement of black Africans because, in the eyes of the masters, they were not human with their dark skin and that they were nothing more than property. Yet the concept of one group of people enslaving another went on long before that time in history. Again, some groups of people believe other people were bad because they are different from them?!\n\n**Study Source: [ChangingMinds](http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/in-group_bias.htm)**\n\n\n# **We lie to ourselves to make our decisions feel better:**\n\n<center>http://discovermagazine.com/~/media/Images/Issues/2013/June/self-deceit.jpg</center>\n\n**Image Source: [DiscoverMagazine](http://discovermagazine.com)**\n\nI found an interesting article on a website called Livescience called \u201cWhy We Lie\u201d by Robin Lloyd in that article she states \u201cwe all Lie, all the time.\u201d After I read just that part, I was like really? I\u2019m probably not older than that lady and as expected, she\u2019s got me figured out from the first lie I told about using my allowance to buy candy, to the present? Ok, you got me! Yes, I was a liar, and I am putting emphasis on \u201cwas\u201d because, though I admit to my past discretions, I am trying to improve on being truthful. Yay! I'm saved now ;)\n\nThe reason is that, it may be all cool like I got away with something, but things like that have a tendency to come back and bite you in the area of your body you use to sit. The reason we lie? Speaking for myself, I was trying to avoid a whipping for lying to my mom when she asked if I spent all of my allowance on candy so in essence, I was trying to save my own butt. \n\nThere are many reasons why we lie to ourselves to make our decisions better. For example, a job applicant who lies on a job resume to make himself look better as a candidate for a position, or the student who lies about cheating on a test my make himself look scholarly and the degree. So, I would agree with Ms. Lloyd\u2019s statement that \u201cwe all lie, all the time. I would also ask the reader of this article to confess and work on the practice of being truthful, and if you  say you\u2019ve never lied about anything, I say please read this section of the article again. \n\n**Study Source: [LiveScience](http://www.livescience.com/772-lie.html)**\n\n# **Everyone being ignorant maintains our ignorance:**\n\n<center>http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/21/article-0-0B462D3300000578-655_1024x615_large.jpg</center>\n\n**Image Source: [DailyMail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk)**\n\nThis comes from a condition called Pluralistic Ignorance. Trust me the official definition will be found on a link I will provide. The reason I\u2019m not quoting this is that, it is way too long to enter for this article. Now, the informal definition which I have, comes from a game called follow the leader, meaning that groups of people tend to follow what one or a few people would consider to be the normal behavior. \n\nSome individuals may not agree to all of the ideas of the norm, but they go along with it. It\u2019s so true, in band practice, an entire section of the band might play a song of key because they are afraid of making a mistake. What they may in turn do is wait for the best player to start then they will join in. It is unfortunately common, but we harm ourselves in this behavior. \n\nThus as individuals, we do maintain our ignorance by not stepping out and taking chances in order to grow and advance intellectually. The best example in the article was in regards to the instructor asking the class if they have questions or if they understood the material and, no one said anything. Needless to say, it backs up the subtopic statement \u201cEveryone being ignorant maintains our ignorance. \n\n**Study Source: [ChangingMinds](http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/pluralistic_ignorance.htm)**\n\n# **Conclusion:**\n\nThose three inaccurate ways people think socially are just incredible and  have detrimental effects on people today just as they have done throughout history. Instead of improving ourselves and leaving a better world for our children, we still have hostile feelings towards people different from themselves and use that to justify mistreating other people because they want everyone to look and be like them. The second topic of how we lie so we feel good about ourselves I would agree is an interesting on because it has gone on so long that lying has become a lifestyle for most people. And the final topic, of \u201cEveryone Being Ignorant maintains our ignorance is requires deep thought for the reader because unless we as individuals learn to take chances in life and be the brave one to answer the question first, we may be following the one we think is the smartest one when in fact he or she is not.\n\nAnd oh by the way, I hope you liked and enjoyed reading my article.

    "body": "A friend and I met for lunch at a local taco shack near the city's greenbelt, where he planned to take his mountain bike out for a cruise along the trails. As it was a pleasant Autumn afternoon and there was nothing keeping me, I decided to take a walk through the beautiful sun-soaked woods myself.\n\nAfter tacos we made our way to the trail head together, at which point he asked in what direction I was headed. \n\n\"I don't know,\" was my reply. \n\nMounting his trusty carbon-fiber steed he took off and soon disappeared around a bend leaving me there alone. \n\nLooking down the trail to my left, then up the trail to my right \u2026 then back to the left again, as if awaiting some unseen force to propel me in either direction, but feeling no particular pull, I finally rested my gaze upon an opening in the trees just in front of where I stood, and so up the middle I went. \n\nStepping through the woods about forty or so feet, I came out onto a bone-dry creek bed which I then followed. Poking along haphazardly up the old creek bed for ten minutes or more, I looked up and was suddenly bewildered by what I saw. \n\nNot far off in the distance I could just begin to make out what seemed to resemble stalagmites \u2013 a group of twisted, spindling, rocky spires that reminded me of something I might have once seen in Southeastern Utah or the caverns of New Mexico. \n\nAs I drew closer it was impossible to suppress a smile. \n\nHere is what I found ....\n\n![image 1](https://s15.postimg.io/b2gnkfe63/img1.jpg)\n\n![image 2](https://s22.postimg.io/6142bastt/img2.jpg)\n\n![image 3](https://s11.postimg.io/qda6yn9oz/img3.jpg)\n\n![image 4](https://s18.postimg.io/rfx58pcg9/img4_6.jpg)\n\n![image 5](https://s13.postimg.io/b1llkt7nr/img5.jpg)\n\n![image 6](https://s22.postimg.io/o27tdn7cx/img8_9.jpg)\n\n![image 7](https://s3.postimg.io/6xel5spoj/img10_7.jpg)\n\n![image 8](https://s22.postimg.io/xfn5dopr5/img11_12.jpg)\n\nAfter some time I sat down to meditate among the stones. \n\nSitting there in the silence, I at some point found myself moved to envision in my mind's eye a sense of all humanity. This vision encompassed the many individual thoughts, feelings, attitudes and actions of mankind, including those that we tend to regard as undesirable: all of the deceitful, violent, selfish, cunning, calculating hurt and pain that we are capable of inflicting upon others as well as upon ourselves \u2013 those things that we wish to reform within ourselves but about which we often harbor some form of condemnation and contempt for in others.\n\nEventually entering into this vision of the totality of mankind was an opening up to a sense of love, understanding and acceptance for all of it, including our many so called 'detractions'.  \n\nJust as I was coming to this point, from the periphery, now drawing my attention away, was a growing awareness of one such member of humanity incarnate. Indeed, as I looked up, there was a trail runner breaking stride fifty feet or so away from where I sat on my haunches.\n\nHaving clearly run for some distance along the creek bed, he now stood hands on his knees drawing several heavy breaths, before continuing in my direction at a walk. \n\nI tracked him unflinchingly as he passed, anticipating a silent exchange of glances, if nothing else, but he did not so much as motion to look in my direction. \n\nAs he moved along, I let my eyes come to a close once more, attempting to re-calibrate with the vision. Yet, now conscious of his presence somewhere off in the near distance among the rocky spires, my focus waned. \n\nOpening my eyes again I spotted a leg through the cairns. Why him? Why now? Why had this stranger been allowed to intrude upon me at the seeming apex of my meditation? Was this some sort of malevolent ploy orchestrated by the devil himself to prevent me from attaining the enlightened state I was surely just about to reach had I not been interrupted? Damn you again, Universe, for not abetting my spiritual awakening! Though not explicit in such words, this was the essence of my mental reaction to the situation at hand.\n\nThen the following realization took hold of me: Here before me was a perfect, outward, real-world example, illustrating for me the very thing I had been trying to capture in my meditation. Whereas I had begun opening to embrace, accept, and feel compassion toward the 'negative' within my meditative mind-state, I was now all too readily rejecting and mentally discarding what I perceived to be a negative outcome unfolding for me in actual experiential reality. I was condemning rather then embracing my own experience. \n\nWith that, I again closed my eyes, intent on letting go of the idea that this runner's presence had somehow arrived as an inconvenience, and instead attempted to welcome it as a practical instantiation of the very thing I had been meditating on.\n\nWithin no time at all I was stirred again by the sound of footsteps. The same man having circled round, now walked by me again, heading back in the direction he had come, only this time he acknowledged me with a nod and a wave as he passed. I nodded back silently. As he opened up into a run back down the creek bed, I stood up and watched until he was just a trace in the distance.\n\nAfter a few minutes I started back down the creek myself, when another thought struck me, causing me to ponder the implications of what had just transpired still further. The trail runner had appeared to be around my age, roughly the same height, with a very similar build. We both had light hair with a scruffy unshaven face, and had both been shirtless. The more I considered it, our resemblance was uncanny. \n\nHad the Universe, rather than forsaking me, merely been presenting me with a mirror?\n\n*(The preceding account was first written in Autumn of 2013, shortly after it occurred.

All STEEM Dollars for these posts go to the featured author.</strong></strike>\n\n<strike><strong>If you are looking to be featured as an author, please contact me via email - ben.adaptnetwork@gmail.com</strong></strike>\n\n<strong>Edit: From the comments, it seems that this type of author promotion is not the way to go. A 're-steemit' button has been suggested and I think this is a great idea.</strong>\n\n<hr>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6z5In5y.jpg\"/></center>\n\nIf you've played the indie-hit video game <a href=\"http://www.firewatchgame.com/\">FireWatch</a>, by Campo Santo, then chances are that you fell in love with the idea of staying in a fire tower, just as I have.\n\nThe American novelist and poet, Jack Kerouac, famously spent the summer of 1956 manning a fire tower on Washington\u2019s Desolation Peak, in the northern Cascades. Even though he was alone with pencil and paper by design, he didn\u2019t get much writing done. I don\u2019t blame him, the views from the tower are incredible and there\u2019s plenty to fill an adventurer\u2019s time for 63 days.\n\nSo, if the idea of a few days in the sky in a cool-looking fire tower is appealing, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that you can actually rent one of these bad boys.\n\nSince Jack Kerouac\u2019s stay in the 50s, new technologies have made fire lookouts mostly obsolete, some were even torn down. Others were left to rust and splinter, becoming squatter\u2019s dens and canvases for high-altitude graffiti artists. But dozens around the US have survived and are available for rent, evolving into modest sources of revenue for the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s depleted accounts. The Forest Fire Lookout Association maintains a list of available towers; many are available for as little as $20 a night.\n\n<strong>Lets take a look at a few below:</strong>\n\n<h2>1. Black Mountain Lookout, California</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tbHIiBQ.jpg\"/></center>\n\nBlack Mountain Lookout is located on the eastern edge of the Beckwourth Ranger District, 10 miles from Highway 395, near Milford, California.\n\nThe lookout was constructed in 1934 and is a great example of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) architecture. The C-3-type lookout is situated on a single story 10 foot tower and is extremely well-preserved.\n\nThe one-room lookout cabin is set on a tower, rising 10 feet above the ground. It is furnished with two single beds with mattresses, but can accommodate up to four people. There is also space for tent camping adjacent to the lookout, for up to four visitors.\n\n<strong>A closer look in pictures:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NX0S10Y.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HgS38WU.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ULzb0dV.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ljj8y7X.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>2. Hirz Mountain Lookout, California</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6z5In5y.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThis fire tower sits atop Hirz Mountain, California at an elevation of 3,540 feet, offering 360-degree views of Mt. Shasta\u2019s snow-laced peak to the north.\n\nThe McCloud River Wintu tribe held Hirz Mountain in reverence and had a name for it in their own language. But it was a miner, Henry Hirz, who gave the mountain its modern name.\n\nWhen the lookout was built, it was originally a structure that sat on the ground. The mountain was a strategic location for detecting fires because it had a direct view into the headwaters of the McCloud River and most of its tributaries. In 1937, the Forest Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps rebuilt the Hirz Mountain Lookout cabin and included a garage and outhouse. It was one of the last CCC-era lookouts to be built. In 1949, a steel tower was added, constructed of a steel K-brace tower that stands 20 feet above ground level.\n\n<strong>A quick look inside the tower:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uZq8dZ5.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZCHllVy.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>3. Hornet Lookout, Montana</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bD8F1wJ.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe Hornet Lookout is as old school as it gets and features a two-story construction. The ground level provides a living space for two guests and the second story is a small loft used solely for full views of the region. The lookout\u2019s rustic accommodations include a propane cook stove, propane lantern and a small wood stove for heat.\n\nThe lookout provides astounding 360-degree views of the surrounding terrain, including Glacier National Park and Kintla Lake on clear days. Apparently, on some nights, the Northern Lights may be seen from the lookout.\n\n<strong>A 'slightly' more modern look:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fbAMzHn.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>4. Fall Mountain Lookout Cabin, Oregon</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/EyIpkj8.jpg\"/></center>\n\nFall Mountain Lookout Tower is situated about 20 miles from John Day, in central Oregon. It provides 360-degree views of the surrounding Strawberry Mountain Wildness, as well as the towns of Seneca and Mt. Vernon.\n\nThe tower was built in 1933 and sits at an elevation of 5,949 feet. Before satellite surveillance systems, lookout personnel monitored the forest from this 18-foot perch for signs of smoke, alerting fire guards when necessary. Today guests can watch the sun rise and set, spot wildlife from the catwalk and witness dramatic thunderstorms that traverse the territory during summer months.\n\nThe one-room, 14-by-14 cabin sits atop an 18-foot tower and sleeps two. The cabin is furnished with a futon bed and a table and chairs. It has electricity and in the kitchen area, an electric stove and refrigerator.\n\n<strong>Here's a few more snaps:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fVoStKq.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/sUrDl58.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3CrgXdi.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LejQWOZ.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>5. Indian Ridge Lookout, Oregon</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/861cU5N.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe Indian Ridge Lookout sits at an elevation of 5,405 feet in the Willamette National Forest. Indian Ridge was named for the old Indian hunting trail that runs along the summit.\n\nBuilt in 1958, the lookout was used for firefighting by Forest Service personnel until 1973 and is still staffed occasionally during emergencies.\n\n<strong>A closer look inside the tower:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vBd3iLs.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DKt5G2z.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FJePMYG.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ULzb0dV.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>6. Little Guard Lookout, Idaho</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ifhnbPK.jpg\"/></center>\n\nThe newest tower on this list, the Little Guard Lookout is located about 9 miles north of Shoshone Camp, was one of the last remaining fire lookouts used in the Coeur d\u2019Alene River area and has only just recently become inactive.\n\nThe structure standing today on Little Guard Peak is the third in a series of lookout buildings that originated back to 1919. In October 1990, Little Guard Lookout was accepted for listing in the National Historic Lookout Register and the first for Idaho.\n\nThe fully furnished two-story fire lookout has dimensions of 14 x 14 feet, an external cat walk, and a gabled roof. It sleeps four guests, but space is tight. The kitchen is on the ground floor and is equipped with a small propane refrigerator, propane cook stove, table, chairs and basic cooking utensils.\n\n<strong>A few more photos:</strong>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NXtu1ZE.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/pPy4Dxj.jpg\"/></center>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wuBRx3w.jpg\"/></center>\n\n<h2>7. Spruce Mountain Fire Lookout Tower</h2>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dkazLmP.jpg\"/></center>\n\nPerched atop a forested mountain, Spruce Mountain Fire Lookout Tower offers panoramic views that include Medicine Bow Peak, Rob Roy Reservoir, Jelm Mountain and the southern end of the Snowy Range. After being occupied as a fire lookout, the 55-foot tall structure was renovated and opened to the public for overnight rental in 1977.\n\nThe lookout cabin is furnished with two single beds with mattresses and can accommodate up to four guests. Inside amenities include a table with chairs, cookware, dishes, utensils, cleaning supplies, a propane heater, propane cook stove and oven, propane refrigerator and propane lights.\n\n<em>All photos: courtesy <a href=\"http://www.recreation.gov/\">Recreation.gov</a></em>\n\n<strong>For more information on renting one of these towers visit <a href=\"http://www.firelookout.org/lookout-rentals.html\">firelookout.org</a>.

If it is impossible, then the mirror represents a basic symmetry of nature. If it is possible, then nature is not symmetric in that way, and the change matters to the laws of nature. This touches on some of the most unexpected discoveries in the history of physics and includes a clue to a basic puzzle about the cosmos\u2014namely, how atoms could exist. \n\n----------------------\n\n# Our \ufb01rst mirror re\ufb02ects space, exchanging left and right. Physicists call this parity. \n\n<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Parity_1drep.png</center>\n<center>wikipedia</center>\n\n\nOur universe was long assumed to possess parity. Newton\u2019s laws of motion and the laws of electromagnetism work exactly the same way in the re\ufb02ected world. In 1956, Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee realized that the nuclear forces, the force responsible for beta decay, make a fundamental distinction between left and right. Their theory was later con\ufb01rmed by Chien-Shiung Wu. Beta decay almost always emits particles in one direction (i.e., asymmetrically), following a right-hand rule.\n\n-------------------\n\n# The next mirror is not a re\ufb02ection in space but in the properties of matter, called charge conjugation. This mirror turns matter into antimatter, and vice versa.\n\n<center>http://www.lhc-closer.es/webapp/files/1435504471_46ed2c40babcc6bacacc2743c3ed3bcd.jpg</center>\n<center>[lhc](http://www.lhc-closer.es/webapp/files/1435504471_46ed2c40babcc6bacacc2743c3ed3bcd.jpg)</center>\n \nAntimatter was predicted in 1927 by English physicist Paul Dirac, who was trying to reconcile relativity and quantum theory. Antimatter is made of antiparticles\u2014particles of the same mass but opposite electric charge to the particles in the matter we know. Dirac\u2019s prediction was con\ufb01rmed when positrons, of the same mass but opposite charge as electrons, were discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson. Why matter is so common and antimatter is so rare is actually a profound mystery. What would an antimatter universe look like? It would look pretty much the same as our universe. Positrons would repel positrons just like electrons repel electrons, and so forth. However, charge conjugation is not an exact symmetry. As with parity, the direction of beta decay is \ufb02ipped. However, if you combine parity and charge conjugation\u2014in other words, \ufb02ip the universe twice, beta decay looks symmetrical again! One asymmetry that remains in this double-\ufb02ipped universe has to do with rare particles called K-mesons. The combination of these laws is almost, but not quite, a symmetry. \n\n--------------------\n\n# The third and \ufb01nal mirror is time-transformation exchanging future and past. \n\n<center>https://www.phy.anl.gov/mep/atta/images/EDM_Figure.jpg</center>\n<center>[phy.anl.gov](https://www.phy.anl.gov/mep/atta/images/EDM_Figure.jpg)</center>\n\nIt does not seem possible that this is a symmetry, thanks to the second law of thermodynamics, the arrow of time. However, the second law is always about huge numbers of particles, and it is only a statistical law. Entropy decreasing is not strictly impossible, only incredibly unlikely. When 2 similarly charged particles approach each other, at a certain point they repel and \ufb02y apart. Run the process backward, and it looks exactly the same. No one is quite sure how to solve this paradox: The universe seems to have time-symmetric laws, but its large-scale behavior is not at all the same in the time mirror.\n\n----------------------\n\n# Together, relativity and quantum theory imply that the combination of all 3 mirrors must be an exact symmetry of nature. \n\n\n<center>http://www.antimaterie.at/fileadmin/downloads/cpt_symmetry_detailed_a_01.png</center>\n<center>[antimaterie](http://www.antimaterie.at/fileadmin/downloads/cpt_symmetry_detailed_a_01.png)</center>\n\nCharge, Parity, and Time Reversal (CPT) Symmetry \n\n-------------------------\n\n# Symmetry  in Sci-fi\n\n<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Journeyfarsidesun.jpg</center>\n<center>wikipedia</center>\n\n\nThe spaceship in the science \ufb01ction movie Doppelg\u00e4nger visits a version of Earth that was re\ufb02ected in the parity-mirror. \n\n----------------------------",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>I have mentally struggled with this situation for many years. &nbsp;My family was extremely frugal. &nbsp;So frugal in fact that my mom did the majority of shopping at Goodwill and had an advanced method of switching the tags so she could get better pricing. &nbsp;She would even purchase the clothes and then take those tags off and put them on a different pair of clothes we out grew. <strong>&nbsp;This was clearly dishonest and I have never stooped this this level myself.</strong> &nbsp;If you aren't from the United States Goodwill is a second hand store. &nbsp;It is like going to a garage / yard sale that is inside. &nbsp;All Goodwill stores smell the same way for some reason. &nbsp;Kind of like a couch that has been left in a shed since 1972. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm not complaining I'm just stating the facts. &nbsp;This frugal nature has rubbed off on me as well and I rarely buy new clothes. &nbsp;We did have certain things that were nice and the best part about growing up where I did is that we had privacy and 36 acres of land. &nbsp;I did a lot of work for farmers growing up and was able to purchase dirt bikes, four wheelers, snowmobiles, and an ultralight aircraft. &nbsp;Honestly I had a lucky childhood in a lot of ways. &nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>Making Payments</strong></h1>\n<p>By the time I was born my parents already had the property paid off and also had a rental house which was the next property over paid off. &nbsp;They did this by just being super frugal and pinching every penny. &nbsp;They also never made payments on vehicles. &nbsp;I remember having a girlfriend in high school that had car payments to make and all her family members cars had loans on them too. &nbsp;That was really weird to me. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have continued this trend of <strong>NOT</strong> making car payments by driving a 2001 Pontiac. &nbsp;It isn't worth much at this point but it runs well and it doesn't cost me much to operate. &nbsp;I don't have a problem with this but once in awhile it kind of gets to me when people almost act like I'm some scrub because I drive an older car. &nbsp;Then you realize they have a 6 year note on their car. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong......I sort of get it. &nbsp;It would be fun to drive a new car and all that. &nbsp;I just don't want payments on stuff. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I FUCKING hate the fact that I don't have my house paid off yet.</strong> &nbsp;I almost have it paid off but still just putting in the sacrifice month after month. &nbsp;I have a 15 year note and have really been chipping away at the principle but it is like the struggle never ends. &nbsp;I feel like I should have had it paid off by now. &nbsp;But then again it is just me over here. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ultimately sometimes I wonder if the struggle is worth it and if I shouldn't just have a 30 year note and make car payments for 7 years and have rented furniture and live the <strong>No Equity Life Style</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>The Conundrom</h1>\n<p>We can die any second. &nbsp;We will often hear about people in their 20's dying in their sleep. &nbsp;Or some random car accident takes out a whole family. &nbsp;<strong>Sometimes I just want to sell out of everything and travel the world and ball out of control.</strong></p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong my life is pretty cool but it could be out of control if I liquidated this property and then applied some leverage and just went rock star status. &nbsp;The struggle is real. &nbsp;I keep thinking in the back of my mind that if I can become \"Bitty Rich\" that all my problems will be solved! &nbsp;<strong>Below is the car I want to get if this happens. &nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2>What do you think Steemit? &nbsp;Have you also dealt with the mental burden of putting in the sacrifice vs just living a no equity life style and living it up? &nbsp;</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/19/vaydor783e1.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"456\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong> &nbsp;The car is a Vaydor. &nbsp;There are only about 20 of these in the world and it is was designed by Matt McEntegart in the Tampa, Florida area. &nbsp;Visit their website at <a href=\"http://vaydorexotics.com/\">http://vaydorexotics.com/</a> to find out more information. &nbsp;If you have seen Suicide Squad that is the car that the Joker is driving! &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/07/31/me-holding-steemitsign-grey-at407c2.png\" width=\"611\" height=\"396\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "# This is an unusual and remarkable story. Though it's beginning is far from inspiring, what it does show is that even devastation can deliver something great. \n\nhttp://belwas.netne.net/images/mk1.jpg\n\n\nI really dislike the term \u201c_Everything happens for a reason._\u201d It minimises and invalidates peoples experiences. Terrible things happen. They shouldn't but they do. I don't believe in fate. I do believe though, that within whatever chance and circumstance delivers, there is opportunity.\u00a0\n\nRecently I have been recovering from running ultra marathons in support of an Australian charity - Bravehearts. They hold an annual event in which participants run seven marathons in consecutive days, starting on the West Coast of Australia and making our way east, finishing on day seven on the Gold Coast in the North East of the country. I am not an athlete, so for me it was no mean feat. My motivation came from an unlikely encounter with a man who has changed me forever, after a man I loved dearly almost destroyed my faith in humanity. \n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12512529_911445782308699_2762424771008664825_n.jpg?oh=5b1eda98b8dc78ec8124e737b19b1fbb&oe=584BDD64\n\n\nAs I was nursing physical injuries sustained in the run, I allowed myself to be still for the first time in a very long time, and I registered with Steemit.\u00a0I believed that a week or two would suffice, and I would then gratefully return to my regular life. In my attempt to restore the life that I new, I brushed over the context of the run in my introductory post. But it was a cause that had completely consumed me, and has proved to be not so easily processed. \n\nAt the completion of the event, I stumbled into July, hoping to find my feet, both literally and figuratively. It is now almost two months since the marathons finished. I have mostly contained the injuries, triumph, bereavement, achievement, and emotion. Throwing myself back into life I have busied myself and now I realise that in doing so I have held it at arms length, and therefore find myself no closer to processing exactly what it is that I accomplished.\n\n# So here it is.\nI\u2019m not sure if this is a rambling journal. I am certainly no journalist, but I feel the need to share my story, or at the very least record it for myself and for those who helped me achieve it. In an attempt to start, I am going to share the journey that has brought me to this day. I could start at a number of places, but I think 2009 is the best reference point.\n\n# On a night not unlike any other in 2009\n\nI am sitting at home with my family. The channel ten news is rolling in the background, and I am going about the bustle of family, evening chaos. A typical, uneventful and otherwise mundane night in a humble suburban home. I stare in the general direction of the television, but am not really watching it. My husband remarks with a hint of alarm in his voice, **_\"Are you seeing this?\"_**\n\nA news story is rolling. Yes I was looking at the TV, so I suppose I was seeing it, but I wasn't really taking it in. We see so much news coming at us all the time, I think we filter it out a lot. It was washing over me, someone else\u2019e story, the news very seldom impacts my tiny existence. So I fix my attention on the screen, and watch as a man is arrested. His face blurred, he is being walked up a driveway. Suddenly the home he is being walked from, flanked by detectives, is familiar. The figure despite the blurred face, unmistakably so.\n\n## The man with the blurred face was my uncle. \nHeld up on pedestal in our family, I had strived my whole life to impress him. Catching the end of the news story, I learned he was arrested for multiple counts of child sexual abuse.\u00a0\n\nI didn't fully understand it at the time, but it is at this very point, that so much that I thought I new was wiped away. The foundation of my life, my childhood memories and the world they were based upon, from this moment were void of truth.\u00a0\n\nhttp://belwas.netne.net/images/IMG_6697.jpg\n_Me at age 4._\n\nHe pled not guilty to scores of charges, the court proceedings were drawn out over years, with multiple complainants, who spanned decades. The cases were split, evidence from one case was prohibited from being shared in another, and jurors were unaware of them entirely. Following a hung jury, and an acquittal, he was eventually found guilty of a number of charges in another case in 2012.\u00a0\n\nI attended the sentencing hearing. The victims had been employees of his, and although they were now adults, some of their faces were familiar to me. The room was full. I hadn't been in such an environment before, and I found myself to my horror, sitting with his supporters. These people heckled and shouted as the charges were read out. The irreverence of these people, to attempt to take from the survivors and their families their moment of justice disgusted me, and I was appalled that I may be mistaken as one of them.\n\n**_I was there to witness the proceedings for my own reasons, and to support my beautiful father as he attempted to process his own complex position, as this man\u2019s brother._**\n\n# It was one of the hardest things I have ever done. \nI sat through almost two hours as each charge was read and detailed. I held my father like he was my child. My uncle entered escorted through a little door that led him to the witness box. I barely recognised him, he addressed me by name and for a moment it felt like the entire world shifted below my feet. I left feeling like I needed to hold my breath in order to walk tall, and to a degree I carry that feeling to this day. Almost like if I exhale fully maybe I will unravel permanently and not be able to recoil myself. I manufactured a strength that became an armour I couldn't take off, and now I don't think I know how to, nor would I want to.\u00a0\n\nI am glad I went. It made the devastating and until now surreal situation very real. It changed me, but not in a bad way. I am more inclined to make decisions for myself and less inclined to give a thought to judgements made by other people. **_When the person you always looked to as your safety net turns out to be only smoke and mirrors, you stop looking to be saved and save yourself instead._** More importantly I laid my eyes on another man. A man who sat directly across from my uncle. His presence was impossible to ignore.\n\n\n**This man was Kevin Whitley.** He sat opposite my uncle. Directly across, and stared at him, holding an indomitable glare the entire time. In his eyes was triumph, anger, pain, fury, pride, satisfaction and pure strength. I assumed he was a parent or support person for the young men he sat in front of. His powerful presence seemed to shield the men behind him, who were sitting I learned later, in the jury seating, as the room was so full.\n\n## I couldn't wipe the mans face from my mind.\n\nThe names of the people who gave evidence during the cases were suppressed. Two men however asked that their names be lifted from the suppression orders so they could share there own stories. It was then, when I saw this mans face in [a newspaper article](http://www.theleader.com.au/story/300346/victims-urge-others-to-speak-out/), that I learned that he was a complainant in the earlier case that had been acquitted.\u00a0\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13315235_251448791882668_8177550636171283508_n.jpg?oh=c3c4156725db82620ba385e249fa9670&oe=583C5B73\n_Kevin, myself and Mark at 1 in Five Gala_\n\n\n\n## I couldn't shake that day. I couldn't shake that face. I decided to write to him. I wrote, and I tore up the letters, and I rewrote. I couldn't even start. What would I say?\nMostly I worried that I would traumatise this man, and potentially intrude on his life uninvited, and cause him more pain. But I needed to do it. I needed to tell this man who I was, and where I stood, and how, unknowingly he had impacted me.\u00a0\n\nSo eventually, almost a year later, I stood at a letterbox for the longest time. With my heart pulsing in my ears, and with a trembling hand, I dropped the latest version of my hand written letter into the letterbox. I had easily found his Facebook account, which linked to his business address. I marked the letter- \"Private and confidential - To be opened by addressee only,\u201d and included a Po Box return address.\u00a0\n\nThe months passed, and although I was consumed by my own life, not least of which was the surprise news that I was expecting a child, I often wondered if he had received it, and how he had reacted. A Facebook request popped up from him, and I freaked out and changed my settings. Okay, that confirmed it, he had definitely received it!\u00a0\n\nBut I didn't know this man. He had my PO Box address. Facebook in my mind was not the way to go, to link our lives, our families and friends, and our children. I couldn't imagine that could ever happen.\u00a0\n\nI thought about him from time to time, but life is busy, and the years passed.\u00a0\n\n## In October 2015 I received a letter. Before I opened it I new it was him. It was addressed with the very same phrasing I had written years before to him.\n\nThe letter was lovely. I had a positive impact on this man. I had helped him. He had even used my letter as the basis for a speech he had recently delivered as a key note speaker at a police ball, in support of an organisation I had never heard of - **Bravehearts.** At the end of the letter was a youtube link to his speech, and a request to meet.\n\nThe speech was incredible. He had utilised a phrase I had used in my letter, \u201c**Ripple Effect**,\u201d to formulate a message of survival, hope and courage. Towards the end of his speech he reached into his pocket, and pulled out my letter. In conclusion to his speech he read my letter aloud to a packed room. **_Holy shit!!_**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhLnue3qoGs\n_Kevin Whitley's speech_ \n\n\n## I watched the video a number of times and googled Bravehearts.\n\nI felt many things, exposed, overwhelmed, proud, these words don\u2019t seem to do justice to how it was that I felt. I emailed him to arrange a meeting.\n\nWe met in a coffee shop in Cronulla, a southern beach side suburb of Sydney. Cronulla holds a great number of long suppressed memories for me, so returning there was both confronting and cathartic. I knew what he looked like, but he didn\u2019t know me. We had a coffee, and I felt surprisingly comfortable.\n\nWhen I had researched Bravehearts, I had come across Bravehearts Adventures, and discovered they held an annual event called the Bravehearts777. Participants run seven marathons, in seven days, in seven states, across Australia.\n\n## At that first meeting as strangers, I propose I run it for him, in his name. \nHe asked me, _\u201cAre you a runner?\u201d_\nI said, _\u201cNo,\u201d_ and laughed.\n_\u201cHave you even done a half marathon before?\u201d_\nI said, _\u201cNO, but I enjoyed the odd fun run before I had a baby last year.\u201d_\n\nHe told me later that he thought I was completely bonkers, but by the end of the day we had decided to enter together. We registered a team which he aptly named, \u201cThe Ripple Effect,\u201d and launched our fundraising campaign. We aimed to raise at least $20,000 for Bravehearts, and also hoped that our story would inspire others to come forward and stand together to effect positive change. **In Australia 1 in 5 children will experience sexual assault before the age of eighteen**. \n\n## With the help of friends, family and the community, and the help of an extraordinary journalist by the name of Daniel Sutton, we hosted among other events, a Cocktail Gala named 1inFive, and achieved a total of $31,847.30 for Bravehearts.\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13310590_251449075215973_2317871616207391497_n.jpg?oh=7c771dfae339df1930ffed206167d7a5&oe=584AC32C\n_Giving speech at 1 in Five gala_\n\nOver the months, Kevin and I worked together to promote our cause, and tentatively navigated our unusual relationship. To call it a friendship in these early days, would be over simplifying the complex situation.\nWe did however seem to trust one another from the start. We both had our reasons for taking this on, so our shared dedication was enough to unite us. \n\nI specifically mentioned the journalist Daniel Sutton. Daniel\u2019s continued involvement is another incredible twist of fate in this story. Incidentally he was the journalist who ran the original arrest story in 2009. He also jumped in at the last minute to host a Bravehearts charity ball, and unbeknown to him Kevin was the speaker on the night. It was only after hearing Kevin speak that he realised the connection. When we formed our team, he promoted our campaign by covering our unusual partnership on the national evening news.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yXr4nY25fM\nWhile shooting the story he showed no hesitation when Kevin asked him to host the Gala. I said earlier that I am not a great believer in fate but I must say Daniel\u2019s involvement certainly challenges that notion. Daniels uncanny connection to our story, and ongoing support, is at the very least testament to his good character and decency. Thank you Daniel. TV journalism needs more Daniel Suttons.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13331013_1017358118341397_1783300328613611685_n.jpg?oh=5ca1a4567f8154be0fea38b8bbb33787&oe=5881CE31\n_Daniel Sutton hosting the 1 in Five gala_\n\n# Australia is currently holding a Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse.\n\nAll survivors nationwide have been invited to lodge a submission to the independent inquiry. As Kevin\u2019s case against my uncle had been acquitted he had never been able to make a victims impact statement. The Royal Commission presented an opportunity to truly share his perspective. Because of the acquittal the media have only been able to refer to Kevin as a whistle blower, or complainant. If they were to use any other term in relation to my uncle, they would breach the legal rights of an incarcerated child predator, and risk litigation. The inquiry however is open to all people who consider themselves survivors, regardless of court proceedings and findings. Our joint campaign and the enquiry had given Kevin the platform he was hoping to find, when he bravely released his name in 2012.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10441403_207055346322013_4098129798661330165_n.jpg?oh=26c14b28c9f944a3991726622d133583&oe=58863B96\n\nKevin was overseas when he was called to appear. He requested that the date be changed, however the nature of the proceedings made this impossible. When he asked me to read his statement on his behalf, I surprised him by agreeing to do it immediately. It wasn\u2019t a difficult decision. To me, this was what our team was actually about. We weren\u2019t runners. The running event provided us with an opportunity to speak to survivors and encourage them, regardless of the situation to stand together for the protection of all children. \n\n### The Royal Commission was the perfect opportunity to show Kevin I was truly committed, for reasons that went beyond a fun run.\n\nMy uncle sent barristers to the hearing to appose my reading of Kevin\u2019s statement. Down to the last minutes I didn\u2019t know if I would be allowed to take the stand. Eventually parts of Kevin\u201ds statement were redacted and I was allowed to read the statement in his absence. The hearings stream live, and I read Kevin\u2019s account in the first person, to the open court.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WchgjuLlsk\n\n## Something else remarkable happened that day. \nI met Mark Lawrence, the other man who had released his name in court in 2012. Mark was a complainant in the case that was not acquitted, and we can therefore call him a survivor of my uncle without fear of litigation. I mindfully use the word survivor rather than victim, as through his difficult life he has not only survived but gone on to thrive. Mark is a true survivor and an inspiration.  He himself a Bravehearts ambassador, Mark had by now already joined our team and although I felt like I already new him,  I had never met him in person before. \n### We sat together as support person for each other, and since that day he has called me sister. \n\nMark lives hundreds of miles away and had flown down to Sydney for the enquiry. He promised to return again for the fundraiser, and true to his word he returned to Sydney, bass in hand, and along with Kevin and his band, he rocked the night.\n\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13312666_249331448761069_273127193222300716_n.jpg?oh=c5ccc115695e48ebbab8b075a4f9d676&oe=5884BA53\n_Mark playing bass with Kevin & his band MOJO at 1 in Five Gala_\n\n\nThe fundraiser was a wonderful success, not only for the thousands of dollars raised, but for the remarkable way in which our families and friends came together. The room was filled with nothing but love and support from everyone. I was expecting a powerful emotive evening, but I wasn\u2019t expecting to have so much fun.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13344537_251896798504534_5406985480071200099_n.jpg?oh=0b175203cc9b6df01ae60c9d197558b9&oe=58510110\n\n\n\n## We smashed our target, had a cracker of a night and had shared our unified message. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmMABvhl0GI\n\n_Video of Kevin and myself speaking at 1inFive Gala_\n\nOur team now included six people. Kevin, Mark and myself, and also Kevin\u2019s partner Vicki, my brother in law Rob, and Bel one of my dearest and oldest friends. They all pledged to run one of the marathons as state runners, to support my attempt to complete all seven. Kevin would travel with me, his knees too arthritic to run, it would be his tour, and I would be his legs.\n\n# All that stood in my way now was the simple task of running almost 300kms in a week, while flying between capital cities every day.\n\n- - -\n\nI arrived in Perth a couple of days early. I stayed with friends who doted on me, and most importantly I got two good nights sleep. My baby now two years old is still not a brilliant sleeper. The only part of the trip I new I was fully prepared for was the early mornings and limited sleep. My training regime well intended and initially consistent, had been hampered by shift work, family commitments, two solid years of sleep deprivation and a bout of whooping cough six weeks out from the mega run. I had also been feeling the emotional toll of my own complex position, which very much impacted my energy and desire to train. Obligation rather than passion drove my training runs in the final weeks.\n\nThe national team consisted of twenty people including myself and Kevin. We met them in Perth the night before the first marathon. We had flown in from every corner of the country. The team was comprised of teachers, health professionals, students, lawyers, bankers and business people. Many of them were mothers fathers and grandparents. The youngest nineteen years old and the oldest sixty two. We all shared the same goal, irrespective of whether we would complete a marathon in three hours or six and a half hours - To give a voice to those without one, and to help make Australia the safest place to raise a child.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13502087_1015553735231236_4308566568164747538_n.jpg?oh=0f198ebf6615260887606f0b9099f40b&oe=585639D3\n_National team minutes before the start of the first marathon._\n\n\nIn my excitement, on the way to meet the team, and only two blocks from the hotel, I impulsively decided to have the Bravehearts777 running man shaved into the back of my head. I popped into a barbershop on Murray St. The barbers seemed amused by me and chuckled and spoke to each other in arabic as I sat expectantly in the chair. It wasn\u2019t a perfect reproduction of the logo, but more an interpretation of it. It seemed like a good idea at the time\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I\u2019m left trying to decide now whether to grow it out, or take the lot off.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13557665_264453107248903_7567079289670131635_n.jpg?oh=356eea613994ce1a786184125534637c&oe=5857C776\n\nEarly the next day we gathered at the starting line in the south bank of The mighty Swan River. With excitement, anticipation and a good dose of nervousness, we set off along the foreshore. Perth had delivered a beautiful morning. I completed the Perth marathon comfortably and steadily, and finished with a positive mind set.\n\n\nThe team flew to Adelaide, our longest flight, and checked into our hotel late in the evening. Up early the next morning I was psyched to hit the track, and keen to run a sub five hour marathon. The Adelaide run was also a very pretty waterfront run, and in spite of my Ornithophobia (fear of birds), I almost enjoyed seeing the black swans that had also joined us in Perth. We ran along The River Torrens and under a number of beautiful bridges. Bravehearts had carefully planned the the courses to be laps of 7km stretches, 3.5km out and 3.5km back. This allowed participants to support one another along the way. Each time someone passed they would hi five  and check in with each other. We all worked together to ensure everyone got across the line. \n\nAt the completion of my fifth lap I was on track for a comfortable sub five hour run, and feeling on top of the world. I gave Kevin a big hug at the aid station where he sat strumming his guitar, and set off. I rounded a corner and in an attempt to relieve my angry quadriceps I smashed my knee in a ballistic squat /stretch. I was shattered and shuffling. The other runners knew, and as they passed they were a great support. \nOne runner remarked, \u201cKeep going, there is a surprise waiting for you around the corner.\u201d\nAs I shuffled on I could see a figure heading my way. It was Kevin, he had come to my rescue. The man I had pledged to run for, supported me across the finish line.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13754636_1034215736698369_3039748475850617514_n.jpg?oh=e3248318d183802f3ccb958bd2c18d71&oe=583FE9CF\n\n\nI prayed that once we got to Melbourne and I had a good nights sleep, I would be good to go in the morning. Melbourne delivered a beautiful day also, and a lake side run in Albert Park, complete with Black swans. However the overnight wish for a miraculous double knee replacement didn't occur. I did decide though at some point midway, with both my knees strapped on, and every single step feeling like murder, that this was actually not such a bad thing. For a couple of reasons. I thought about the survivors who have told me that they have experienced times in their life that felt worse than murder. I also thought about the promise that I made to Kevin to be his legs for the tour, as both his knees are arthritic. In that case it seemed only appropriate that I should do such a run with blown out knees. I finished in a pretty good frame of mind all things considered, only my knees were protesting, the rest of me had a bloody fabulous time. It also turned out that Captain Kev was very capable of holding his own. He cruised home completing his own half marathon. **CHAMP!**\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13590494_1024330467686896_4431911519295518945_n.jpg?oh=9ab61dbab83a49783aff83510fac8c1a&oe=587E5240\n\nWe flew to Hobart next, the capital of Tasmania. What a charming little city. We didn\u2019t see a hell of a lot of the places we ran. The airport, the drive to the hotel, the drive to the running track, and the 7km lap. I had only been to Tasmania once before. I had visited Launceston and fell in love with the place, but I have never been to Hobart. What I did see of it was divine, a picturesque hidden secret. AND COLD!! To cold for swans too it seemed, not a black swan in sight.\n\nMy broken knees didn\u2019t like the cold at all. I shuffled to the starting line. As long as I shuffled and didn\u2019t lift my feet off the ground, I wasn\u2019t too bad. As the runners set off, I attempted to follow. They ran ahead, their ears plugged with music, and I wailed! I screamed! A down hill start in the cold Tasmanian winter was murder. Even Kevin setting out on his next half marathon walk, with his newly discovered endurance capacity, was ahead of me. He thought I had headed off with the other runners, and with his music in his ears too, he was unaware I was behind him. Our team mentor Shane, one of the amazing support staff had heard me. He rode up behind me on his bike. I refused to give up, so he rode ahead to the aid station at the turn around point to retrieve the first aid supplies. I agreed to meet him there. He also alerted Kevin, who came to my rescue again.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13524390_1457656720927247_147936149042902520_n.jpg?oh=ce007f7ba3f598aa4eba36a54cca5aef&oe=58819DAC\n_Mentor Shane to the rescue_\n\nKevin suggested that maybe I should stop, that I didn\u2019t have to finish or perhaps we could tag the laps and share the distance. I was enraged! Not at Kevin of course, but I was frustrated and devastated. Every piece of me except my knees was willing. I filled with the emotion of our partnership. I screamed through tears. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get to take this from us! He is waiting for me to fail! He is not taking this from you!\u201d \n\nAnd there it was, that was our moment. The very moment that this man became more than a person with a common cause, and I found it, the strength to continue. I tapped back into the reason we were there. I couldn\u2019t really use my knees at this point, so I shuffled using my hips and my ankles. I met Shane at the aid station he taped my knees in place, and Kayleen, a Bravehearts legend, appeared like The Arch Angel Of Over The Counter Anti-inflammatory Analgesia, and I was off. I surprised myself with how fast I could walk, and I finished. I had time for a 30 second shower, and before I new it I was back at Hobart airport.\n\nI lay on the floor at the terminal gate and cried on the phone to my Husband, Dad, Mum, Sister, and a couple of good mates, including of course Mark Lawrence, who had been a great source of encouragement and strength. My sister and her husband Rob who was running the A.C.T marathon, and my mum were meeting me in Canberra in a matter of hours. I couldn\u2019t wait to see my sister, she knows me like only a sister can. I don\u2019t need to say anything, just being in her company would be fantastic.\n\nTo get to Canberra from Hobart we needed to change flights in Sydney. I flew over my home at dusk, and thought of my babies getting ready for bed below me. I actually live under the flight path and passed over them with my heart, and every other part of me aching. I was missing them desperately. Without them I felt like a vital organ had been removed, and I so very much just wanted to rest my head on my husbands shoulder, or to tuck myself perfectly under his arm. Before leaving for Perth I hadn\u2019t even spent one night away from my baby, and my big girl needed me too although she wouldn\u2019t admit it. And I needed them.\n\nWe weren\u2019t in Sydney long. I headed to the connecting flight and there it was. The contraption I had been fearing. A twin propeller plane. At this point I must make mention of Tassie runner Paul. He was buddied up with me for a number of flights, and helped me through a few sketchy moments. A more genuine man you will never meet. I made friends for life on this trip. \n\nMy Sister, her husband, and our mum met me in Canberra. My mum drove hundreds of kilometres to get there. If I thought Hobart was cold then Canberra was brutal. The coldest Australian City in winter, and often the hottest in summer, Canberra is a funny place. It was purpose built as our nations capital, placed between Melbourne and Sydney in an attempt to appease the rival cities, as neither would abide the other having capital status. In 1911 a man named Walter Burley Griffin won a design competition and Canberra was created. It resulted in an overly organised network of roundabouts, connecting a decentralised suburban structure, with parliament house siting on a hill next to a man made lake. A vast contrast to the haphazard chaos of Sydney that I am accustomed to. \n\n## My mum cried when she saw me. She also delivered much needed analgesia that I had asked her to pick up for me when I called her from Hobart. I ate three hamburgers and a couple of painkillers and headed to bed. \n\nMy brother in law ran an impressive marathon. I power shuffled and finished. Granny (my mum), was there with Kevin at the finish line when I crossed. In spite of the pain I had an enjoyable time. Roughly three hours drive from Sydney, it was the closest run to my family, and with some family there too I felt a great lift in my spirits. \n\nWe flew to Coolangatta that night. While I would have loved a run in Sydney I was grateful that the next two runs would be based from the Gold Coast in southern Queensland, with a New South Wales run just a bus ride south, over the boarder in Kingscliff. \n\nMy darling friend Bel who was to run the last marathon with me, had decided to head up early from Sydney when she heard I was struggling. Mark Lawrence, now friends with her since our fundraiser was picking her up. Vicki, Kevin\u2019s partner also joined us when we again changed flights in Sydney. \n\n# THE TEAM WAS TOGETHER.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13599827_1019406064846003_591041660569446787_n.jpg?oh=8bc9c80d6745b14e44826754b4af5c7c&oe=584C43F7\n\nFollowing my brother-in-laws impressive run in Canberra the rest of the team were coming together a day early for the sixth marathon. Kingscliff, with Mark\u2019s home only a stones throw away, was perfect. We took number six very easy. With my team united I was strong. We finished together, crossing the finish line very injured, but somehow feeling stronger than ever. I was also very grateful to not be getting on another plane. Just a bus back to the hotel.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13510933_1459436437415942_2875361158480137514_n.jpg?oh=8f23eaac5ea6c888813a9017c579c518&oe=584B235D\n_Stumbling across finish line no.6 with Mark Lawrence_\n\n\n\nI\u2019m so grateful to Bel. She came to my rescue and cared for me those last couple of days. At one point I asked her to stop being so lovely as I was scared I would totally unravel if I allowed myself to acknowledge how in need of care I was feeling. I had one more marathon to go, I couldn\u2019t afford to let go of the denial that was holding me together. I didn\u2019t really mean it though, she did so much for me, fed me, tended to my wounds, and made me laugh til it hurt as I lay almost broken next to her in our tandem beds. I can\u2019t express my gratitude, Bel is a beautiful human being.\n\nOn day seven we gathered at the starting line. The Gold Coast Airport Marathon is big. It\u2019s an annual event that draws thousands. The crowds lined the streets. The starting line was crammed full of fresh faced healthy excited participants.\n\nWhen I woke up I could barely open my eyes. It seemed the oedema from the salt loss and resulting fluid shift was no longer confined to my hands and feet. My face was puffy, and I could hardly walk. I let myself have a couple of minutes to cry in the bathroom, then I gathered myself, ate some salt, donned my running gear, and shuffled to the hotel lobby.\n\nThe Bravehearts team gathered on day seven with several of us injured, some to the point that they had decided to withdraw from the last run. They came down nonetheless to support the other. Incredible people, thinking of others, and all the while carrying their own disappointment and injuries, and reliving their own personal experiences and reasons for undertaking this trip. \n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13615019_268437330183814_6354769589680029094_n.jpg?oh=933ead0308e197126c3e333f9ea8e79f&oe=58457CEF\n\n\nEvery National runner had an inspiring and very personal story. By this stage it is not about a passion for running. It\u2019s not about running at all. By the last marathon we are all wearing our personal journey like armour as we triumphantly take to the streets. Surrounded by the shiny, healthy, positive runners lining the street, I felt like I knew something they didn\u2019t, with my swollen knees and ankles taped on, and skin torn away in places from the previous days strapping. \n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13510856_1460165300676389_7805125680339716398_n.jpg?oh=6a44270f20e2210e87adafc567cf9a8d&oe=58433850\n\nPeople talk about taking journeys and learning that they are capable of more, blah, blah, blah\u2026\u2026\u2026\nI\u2019m not about to be one of those people. But I will say this. \n\nDon\u2019t set your expectations of yourself or of what is possible, by the limitations of someone else\u2019s mind. Don\u2019t be scared to step outside of yourself and attempt something someone else tells you you can\u2019t do. Turn their doubt on its head and treat it as a challenge. \n\nAnd if you feel like you need to tell someone something, or maybe you can articulate better if you write and have the opportunity to find the right words, don\u2019t let this misguided world tell you that you shouldn\u2019t or you can\u2019t. \n\nI believe we only ask people for advice to hear what we already know mirrored back at us, to help us find the courage to do what we already know we need to do. So if you are sure you need to do something, do it, don\u2019t wait for permission from others. The same people who told me not to, or suggested that working with Kevin was \u201cinappropriate\u201d have congratulated and supported our ongoing work. \n\n## It\u2019s okay to be the person to redefine what is acceptable and possible.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13501784_1456918131001106_4578029372569800268_n.jpg?oh=acf47c30fd5bc3e2c683f91e551ae89e&oe=58413BFC \n\nI started out on the last run very slowly. Runner after runner passed me. With Bel at my side I cheered for each one as they passed us, and Bel proudly told everyone that I was running number 7 in a week. \n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13627148_975661049213348_1249945599263937991_n.jpg?oh=3d972731a98fb39346b7d8624d36a4e6&oe=58496043\n\nUnlike the last six, this marathon had cutoff times at certain points along the way. So I kept an eye on my borrowed Garmin and kept on shuffling. Every time I felt pain, instead of crying out, I yell **Woohoo!** I told myself it was fabulous and fabulous it became. I let the crowd carry us along. **_I imagined carrying my pain in my pocket, and when that didn\u2019t work, I imagined my pain running and I allowed it to do the work, and I visualised myself sitting in it\u2019s pocket._**\n\nI utilised many different shuffling techniques. When one group of muscles started to hurt, I changed it up a bit and shuffled in a slightly different fashion. By halfway I found my groove, and and started to pass the now less shiny looking runners, who had started out so strong and were now walking. Unlike them, with 21kms to go, I could taste the finish line already.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13606764_975661135880006_8708852275673918701_n.jpg?oh=9bbc5ee22d5c5727a95d8ab0cf40eb30&oe=583F7793\n\n# As I was counting down the kilometres I looked around and realise - I HAVE DONE IT! Well, - I HAVE NEARLY DONE IT!  \nWith very little training and a huge amount of stubbornness, denial, a touch of the crazies and a bloody important message, I have almost completed the Bravehearts777.\n\nBel and I trotted on side by side. We crossed the finish line together, our team waiting. Kevin wrapped me in his arms, and the rest of the team folded around us. I\u2019m not sure how long we remained like this, Kevin let go of his rock star bravado and we both shed a tear. I will treasure that moment for the rest of my life.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13590450_976198829159570_3534310572218008127_n.jpg?oh=74b567d0baec0821332ce679d7ce0b39&oe=583D6A35\n\nWe embarked on this event together, hoping to carefully navigate the sensitive nature of our relationship. Of all the things that I expected to come from this endeavour, I did not expect to come to love this man. Sometime during that week, or perhaps as a culmination of our shared experiences that week, and in the months prior, Kevin Whitley and Mark Lawrence moved into my heart.\n\nI spoke with Kevin recently and said exactly that, \u201cI love you. I didn\u2019t expect that I would. I thought we could accomplish something pretty amazing together, but I didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d\nHe replied, \u201cI love you too Margie.\u201d\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13307384_1017363855007490_6520994094825267830_n.jpg?oh=47c2288c49fdb3bf2dd48e5edc68446b&oe=5882BBA7\n\n###People say you can\u2019t choose your family. You might not be able to choose who you are genetically related to, but you can most certainly choose who you consider family, and who you call your brother.\n\nPeople have also told me that I have done something amazing for Kevin, but he has done so much for me too. He restored my faith in human beings. What I did for Kevin wasn\u2019t amazing, it was just the right thing that rippled along as it went, then other people helped us both build it into something. The Ripple Effect isn't Kevin's or mine, it belongs to everyone who continues to speak out and demand a safer future for our children.\n\nFollowing our great feat, many of the National runners featured in follow up stories in their local news. We didn\u2019t feature in any news articles in our home town of Sydney despite our attempts to engage our local rag. Perhaps this retraction of an article that ran prior to our run explains why.  \n\nhttp://www.belwas.netne.net/images/IMG_6269.JPG\n\n**We won\u2019t be silenced or intimidated**. During our fundraising Kevin spoke to many people. The responses were surprising, varied and unpredictable. One person who was impacted by the Whitley Ripple was Sam McAuliffe. Sam donated a beautiful bike that was auctioned at out fundraiser.  Bel caught wind of the fact that my daughter had her eye on it and out bid everyone to secure it for her.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13265915_249944915366389_3084676633044616038_n.jpg?oh=6dc2ff3357b4120209730798ecf06044&oe=5855EBC6\n\n Sam has entered a team for next year and will be running all seven marathons, and her team mate, my darling Bel will be running beside her in every one. Kevin and I have joined their team too, and will run one or two as state runners to support them.\n\n## The Ripple Effect is real. Your small actions can make a change. Maybe you won\u2019t change the world, but you might change one persons world, and that person just may have the ability to turn your ripple into a tsunami.\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13592407_10153539638852047_2303095799080817242_n.jpg?oh=309c0ed6988db94789f6810b1b56471c&oe=58474F22\n\nhttps://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13537780_1461002907259295_5427742891405442313_n.jpg?oh=7613fc157c66edfac27e6853446c69a8&oe=583DF2A7\n_National team, Kevin and I front & centre._\n\n## If you fancy a whirlwind tour of Australia, and a week that you will never forget.

It perfectly normal to wake up turn to other side and immediately fall asleep. That's not insomnia. It's the same story if you wake up to go to toilet or have a glass of water and subsequently fall asleep. However, if you wake up and can't fall asleep again for a long period of time, you actually might be suffering from insomnia.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth no. 2</strong> - A<em> good sleep is at least 8 hours a day.</em></p>\n<p>For kids a sleep is the most important part of their life. They sleep at least 8 hours or more. As a person is getting older his needs change. An adult need to sleep around 7 hours older people even less. We should have in mind that the need for sleep is very individual. Some people its is argued that its about 2% need to sleep only 4 hours a day, on the other hand some of us need at least 9. (See my other article how to sleep the most effective way: <a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@thiras/effective-sleep-how-to-do-it-less-is-more\">https://steemit.com/life/@thiras/effective-sleep-how-to-do-it-less-is-more)</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://sowhatfaith.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/long-life.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"319\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Myth no. 3 </strong>- <em>the more you sleep the longer life you have.</em></p>\n<p>This information is not correct. People who tends to sleep over 10 hours have generally shorter life then others. The reason behind such a long sleep might be a sleep apnea. It's a state when the patient does not breathe for a period up to 10 seconds, he subsequently realizes that and goes back to sleep. A fist signal might be snoring. Apnea is usually connected to cardiovascular problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth no. 4.</strong> - <em>Who likes to sleep tends to be fat.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>It is exactly the opposite, people who sleep a lot tends to be more fit, because during the sleep of adults the body tends to digest. Staying late and uneven distribution of sleep makes you feel more hungry. Shorter sleep also logically gives more time to eat :).</p>\n<p><strong>Myth no.5.</strong> -<em> Sleep more today and less tomorrow.</em></p>\n<p>It is not possible to sleep for the future. If you don't sleep during the week, you cannot make up for it during the weekend, period. Sleep deficit cannot be slept to. The more you will sleep the worse you will feel just wake up and go on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://unclutteredwhitespaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-12-at-11.51.59-AM.png\" width=\"631\" height=\"379\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Enough with myths what do I do wrong then?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>In the evening do not drink tea, coffee, coke or energy drinks (duh!). We all knows that caffeine helps to stay awake. How ever you might use coffee to conduct a power nap, wonder how to? See: <a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@thiras/reboot-your-brain-in-15-minutes-productivity-enchanted-power-nap\">https://steemit.com/life/@thiras/reboot-your-brain-in-15-minutes-productivity-enchanted-power-nap</a></li>\n  <li>Alcohol makes you fall asleep but the quality of sleep is generally worse, so try not to drink before going to sleep.</li>\n  <li>Do not eat hardly digestible plates 3 hours before going to sleep. &nbsp;Do not smoke. If you must smoke do not smoke at least an hour before going to sleep.</li>\n  <li>If you can get out for a while before sleeping do it. A short walk helps you tremendously.</li>\n  <li>Never work out 3-4 hours before sleep.</li>\n  <li>It will wake up your organism, work out in the morning.</li>\n  <li>Do not study, work, eat etc. in bed its mainly for sleep so leave that way.</li>\n  <li>Most importantly make a routine when you go to sleep and when you wake up, KEEP THAT ROUTINE. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</html>",

    "body": "http://www.bhmpics.com/thumbs/two_lions_sitting_at_rocks-t3.jpg\n\nMy last holiday experience with my husband before he passed away was very exciting and one I will cherish forever. \n\nWe went to Pilanesberg National Park. I could not imagine a better holiday than spending it with all my loved ones (five children and my husband). The only bit of sadness was that my daughter, her husband and my grandchild who lived in Australia was not able to join us.  \n\nWe spend our times in the evening\u2019s playing cards and talking around the fire and enjoying one another\u2019s company, listening to the animal sounds outside the camp and trying to identify which animal sound it is that we can hear. We decided to go for a game drive early the next morning. \n\nI love lions and every time we go to the national park, I pray that I would have the privilege of seeing a lion. A lion is so majestic; they are without any doubt the King of the jungle. They look so proud and handsome. \n\nWe woke up early at 4:30 and drove into the game reserve at 5:00 when the gates opened. It was a beautiful sunny morning and after seeing elephants, rhinos, giraffes, springbuck, kudus, blue wildebeest and impala, we decided to go to a big waterhole.\n \nhttp://www.karongweportfolio.com/Karongwe/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Lions-at-water-hole.jpg\n[Image Credit](www.karongweportfolio.com/Karongwe/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Lions-at-water-hole.jpg)\n\nBefore we even reached the turn off to the waterhole, we could see a lot of vehicles standing from afar. We passed a vehicle coming from the waterhole and Gawie stopped them to ask what was going on. They told us that there were two lions around the waterhole.  I felt the disappointment beating in my heart. Everyone will be watching the Lions, and they will disappear before I get to see them as there were probably about 50 cars waiting in a queue to look at them.\n \nAs we parked behind the last car, I could see the Lions in a distance walking next to the dam. We took a few photos, and then the lions moved away from the dam towards the veld. After about 5 minutes I became really excited as they were walking in our direction. I could not believe that my prayers were going to become true. They reached the road two cars ahead of us and then started walking down the road up to our vehicle. They passed in front of our vehicle, I was so excited and stopped taking photos, my heart was beating tremendously that I could see the King of The Jungle so close up.\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8e/6b/9b/8e6b9bc9484894e8b077b76069b05a00.jpg\n[Image Credit](s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8e/6b/9b/8e6b9bc9484894e8b077b76069b05a00.jpg)\n\nThen the adrenalin started pumping even faster when one of the lions walked past the front of the vehicle turned and walked along the side of our vehicle so close that if I stretched out my arm I could have touched him. I could see the yellow eyes looking at me, probably thinking hmm breakfast! The purring of his breath felt like it vibrated into my soul. I saw the rippling muscles as he strutted by. The strength in those paws, each as big as my head, is quite amazing.  He then turned around at the back of our vehicle and walked back to my window and then headed into the veld, where about 5m from our vehicle he again stood still, looked at us for about two minutes and then turned around and walked back to the dam.\n\nA Slight breeze brushed through my hair and the early morning wind cooled my flushed face, only then I realized that my window was open, that I never closed it because I was too fascinated by the King of the Jungle.\n \nThose cold, yellow eyes, that powerful purr, that magnificence which is Lion, will remain etched in my brain for eternity. \n\nInteresting facts about Lions.\n------------------------------\n\nThey are the most sociable of the cat species and bond together to protect the cubs of the pride and to hunt together. You can only find them in Africa and India. Their habitat are mostly savannah and grasslands, but some lions also like the bush and forest.  \n\nA pride of lions is normally not more than 15 and consists of related females, their cubs, and two to three males. \n\nThe female lions do the hunting, and they normally do it in groups stalking medium to large sized prey, examples are buffalo, wildebeest, zebra, and gemsbok. \n\nhttp://luxeadventuretraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Jdombs-Travels-Lion-SkySafari-4.jpg\n[Image Credit](luxeadventuretraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Jdombs-Travels-Lion-SkySafari-4.jpg)\n\nThe male lions then get to feast on their prey first while the cubs and the females look on. After the males have finished eating and are full, the cubs and females are allowed to eat the rest of the carcass.  \n\nThey sleep during the day and are then busy at twilight and into the night hunting their prey. Lions are territorial. They mark their area with urine and by roaring. The sound of a roar can carry 8km far. \n\nIf you would like to know more, I have added a link to a wonderful site:\nhttp://www.africa-wildlife-detective.com/african-lions.html\n\nhttp://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/ee/e8/6e/eee86e259ca02bd38fab00f4d2886e58.jpg\n[Image Credit](media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/ee/e8/6e/eee86e259ca02bd38fab00f4d2886e58.jpg)\n\n**Don't forget to follow @bubblefantasy!!** \n--------------------------------------- \n\n**@crazymumzysa features authors to promote new authors and a diversity of content.

There's been tremendous technological innovation with steem and it's innovative #blockchain features - We'll be focusing on one aspect of that innovation (the blogging, reward mechanics, and it's psychological impact on our many personas). This series aims to dive into what I call \"the steem persona conundrum\"  - A high level <em>steem specific</em> sociologically dive mainly at persona dynamics on the platform along with potential helpful guidance. \n\n<img src=\"https://s3.postimg.org/f0eyozgsj/logo.png\">\n\n<h2>The Conundrum</h2><img src=\"https://s3.postimg.org/gz9z5tu5v/Screen_Shot_2016_08_16_at_7_28_34_PM.png\">\n<em>Photo John Saddington</em>\n<p>As an author on steem you most likely at one point have asked yourself.. \"What kind of blogger am I?\".  The actual dilemma is your most likely articulating this type of Q&A with yourself over and over.  In fact this is probably something you ask yourself daily.  Remain focused on creating high value for everyone and clarity can come.  \n</p>\n<h2>Persona Chaos Theory</h2>\n<img src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/719rk4d59/image.jpg\">\n<br>\n<em>Image Source: Digital Times</em>\n<p>\nIt ultimately can be difficult to pick a theme for your posts. \n\n<strong>You are a multidimensional human being.  </strong> \n\nEducation, insight, guidance, support.. there's a lot to pick from. Bring the steem passion regardless of which direction you end up going.  It's been said writers are good because they talk about what they know - I say bring some passion to your content and turn Chaos into magic. \n</p>\n<h2>Chaos Magic</h2>\n<img src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/nde4vffel/Screen_Shot_2016_08_16_at_8_12_35_PM.png\">\n<br>\n<em>Image Source: Nomad Mag</em>\n<p>\nThe Chaos magic is in you.   Direct all the various directions the neurons in your brain are firing off and commit to the ones your passionate about.  Write them down.  Highlight the concepts that you feel most passionate about.  Commit to the list and dedicate yourself to them.  Rince and repeat.   How you handle complete goals in your life can be very similar how you focus on handling your Persona Conundrums. \n</p>\n\n<em>Future posts will cover handling your personas in more details - should you have multiple accounts? Could steem benefit programmatically with personal \"channel\" features?</em>\n\nMore coming soon! \n\n@originate",

    "body": "http://7063-presscdn-0-54.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Pickup-artist.jpg\n(www.selfstairway.com)\n\nAn attractive woman needs only dress the part and go to the venue of her choice, advertise her availability, and she will have any number of suitors buying her drinks, dropping cheesy lines, and trying to get her attention. Don\u2019t be one of those guys, lest you just become one minnow in a school of 1000\u2019s. Your efforts must focus in presenting yourself as a guy who is a different and refreshing alternative to the masses of beggars\u2026 \n\n# Don\u2019t Be Like Every Other Guy. Do anything to distinguish yourself.\nhttp://www.directexpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Shy-guy-in-bar.jpg\n(directexpose.com)\n\nSuppose you spot the most attractive woman in the room. Other men have been buying her drinks and begging for \u201ca chance\u201d... she\u2019s either rejecting the drink offers outright, or accepting them and possibly reciprocating with a little conversation (don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not getting anywhere with her). You know better though.\n\nRelax, take your time, and build a little tension first. Have a drink or two to take the edge off and boost your confidence. Position yourself and wait till you two have caught each other looking at one another a few times. If she\u2019s looked at you more than once, and particularly if you\u2019ve gotten a smile back, it's time to make your move\u2026 but you\u2019re not going to go over and offer to buy her a drink. That's what everyone else would do. \n\nYou\u2019re going to walk over and say something playful, funny, and most importantly *not* begging for attention. Something like \u201cAre you just going to stare at me all night or are you gonna buy me a drink?\u201d or \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you asked for my number yet?\u201d... Don\u2019t be afraid to rattle her a little. If her tag on her dress is flipping up and sticking out, jokingly point it out to her. Give her a hard time about whatever she\u2019s drinking or about how she should have been all over the last guy that you saw hit on her if you\u2019re witty and funny. If you pull it off with the proper light-hearted sense of humor, congrats, you\u2019ve got her attention now. Talk about whatever you want, but please no \u201cyou\u2019re so beautiful\u201d\u2019s.\n\n# Your Time and Attention Isn\u2019t Free. Make her work for it\nEvery other guy desires her and willingly gives his time and attention to her for free. She has no shortage of men\u2019s attention and is free to pick who she chooses. There is no excitement, fun or perceived value in having something which cost you nothing. If my time and attention is freely given then what value can it possibly have to her? \n\nTo the woman who has plenty of options in suitors you must communicate that she should value your time and attention. You must communicate that you have options beyond her and it is on her to compete for your attention. Is she with another female friend? Give her friend equal conversation and attention. She will realize there is competition about and you are of interest to other women, and you may realize you like the friend more anyway. \n\n# Don\u2019t state the obvious or compliment like everyone else\nUse compliments very sparingly. If you think someone may have told her it before then save that compliment for another time. When you do compliment, don\u2019t compliment her over things she has no control over. If she has the perfect cheek bones, or gorgeous blue eyes she already knows this and she didn\u2019t have control over it anyway. Say something pleasant about something she *does* control. Her hair style. Her shoes. Her taste in single malt scotch. Something that is uniquely her. \n\n# Don\u2019t talk about yourself unless asked a direct question\nFirst off, mysterious is attractive. Let her thoughts wander about who you are. If you tell her all about yourself without being asked one of two things happen. If you\u2019ve had a storied life that\u2019s impressive and you become a braggart, or it's not and you become boring. Better to ask her questions and let her talk about herself\u2026 everyone loves talking about yourself. So be generous and let her talk about herself to her hearts content.\n\n# Give the gift of missing you\nThis mantra applies as much when first meeting someone as it does in an established relationship. You\u2019ve gotten her attention and she\u2019s interested in you. Don\u2019t keep it going to the to the point she must excuse herself or leave the convo. You\u2019re a busy guy and you\u2019ve got other things to do is the idea you want her to have. Don\u2019t get boring. Don\u2019t let the conversation run out of steam. Always end the interaction leaving her wanting more.\n\n# The departure\nWe are talking about desirable women here so this won\u2019t be some one night stand. So if you want to see her again, you\u2019re gonna need to have a means of communication post-meet. Asking for her number though\u2026 that shifts the power to her and we don\u2019t want that, as silly as these games we play may be. It also sets you up for possible rejection. Give her *your* number and tell her to text you so you\u2019ve got it. Or give her your email and tell her with a laugh that you don\u2019t give your number out to strangers. \n\nPut the onus on her to contact you, or at least initiate it. Once again, you're being different and memorable, and you're communicating self confidence that she will. \n\n### Watch any love story of your choosing... watch it objectively and you'll see why the above advice works and conventional \"*wisdom*\" does not.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this article!

    "body": "https://i.imgsafe.org/5b6bd30021.jpg\n\nMy dad took a big step yesterday. Actually, he has taken multiple big steps in the best few months. I convinced him to move to Savannah, where I live, about 8 months ago. He was still living in the small, country town we both grew up in. I moved off 5 years ago for college. I graduated last November and have been working as a designer ever since. I was working for an awning company, as their personal graphic designer. It was a nice gig, but it wasn't going to be forever. My boss there informed me he was looking for an installer, someone to install the awnings after they were complete. Long story short, I got my dad an interview for the position and he got it! \n\nHe finally moved out of our small town and had a new job. Sadly, as we worked there longer and longer we started to slowly realize it was a terrible company. I won't go into details or names, but they were pretty much convicts. Luckily I got a job at the best design firm in Savannah and started work there about 6 weeks ago. I told my dad to tough it out and I would get him a job at the design firm. This week, he started as our wide format printer vinyl graphics technician! No more standing on top of ladders and drilling through concrete and steel for him! Did I mention that our new job just won Small Business of the Year in Savannah!? I have loved it here so far and my dad just started yesterday.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b54138c8f.jpg\n\nMy dad and I have done adhesive vinyl work on the side for a few years now, lettering vehicles , signs and store windows using a $400 machine purchased on Ebay. Boy that experience with that machine really paid off today. His first two jobs today required him to cut and weed vinyl. It was just like using the little machine and they were finished in just minutes. I think our boss may have been impressed. After work, I had a business meeting at the Social Club downtown, so my dad was able to tag along and have a Corona. \n\nThe meeting went well, I secured a new freelance job building a website and we made some new Crypto friends! Such a small world, these guys knew of Bitcoin and one of them claimed to have mined Litecoin a while back! They were cool guys and we introduced them to Steemit. They were blown away and could not wait to join and get started! One of the guys , Dillon, is a standup comedian and is going to wear a Steemit shirt at his next gig and post it! I think the community will get a nice kick out of it, he is a super funny guy.\n\nAfter the meeting, to celebrate the great things that happened that day, my dad and I tried a new restaurant in downtown Savannah. It was the Cafe Collin's Quarter Bar. Imagine West Village NYC meets Melbourne Australia with a dash of Southern Hospitality! A nice little place with some incredible food! Not to mention decent prices and fantastic service. Our waiter, Eli made the whole experience ten times better. We each enjoyed a nice glass of Californian red, Robin K. \"Cabernet\", seated at a window overlooking the historic Chippewa Square.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b541b3a49.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b543af12d.png\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b541e5a19.jpg\n\nI ordered the Big burger, it was delicious. (house ground brisket, brioche bun, cheese, spicy fries) \n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b542f2df5.jpg\n\nMy dad got the Pork Ribeye with a potato cake and seared veggies straight from the Chef's garden!\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/5b54344ce6.jpg\n\nToday was so good, let's just say my mouth is watering from typing this and we couldn't be more content after my dad's first day at a new job! I hope today is an indication of how well his new job is going to work out! It was just an awesome day. My dad took the risk of moving, starting two different new jobs and so far it seems like it was a great decision. Now we get to hang out after work and explore the town of Savannah together. Tonight we are going to see a concert after work!\n\n#steemit\n#food\n#adventure\n#news",

    "body": "> \"Your body cannot heal without play. Your mind cannot heal without laughter. Your soul cannot heal without joy.\" - Catherine Rippenger Fenwick\n\n## The Emotional Side Effects of Laughter \n\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/1zqwwb9.jpg\n\nLaughter helps you relax and recharge, reduce stress, increase energy, and help dissolve distressing emotions. Ever notice you don\u2019t feel anxious, angry, or sad when you\u2019re laughing? It's not possible to experience these emotions when laughing.\n\nAnd the best part? Laughter requires no instructions, it's free, it's fun, and it\u2019s priceless. Just like MasterCard :)\n\nShared laughter is even more powerful than laughing alone, it creates a positive bond that can strengthen relationships by triggering positive feelings. That bond then acts as a buffer against emotions such as stress, disagreements, and disappointment during difficult times. Humor also keeps relationships fresh and exciting, and is a powerful way to heal resentments and disagreements.\n\nIncorporating more laughter and play can improve the quality of your life, especially for your love relationships. Go to a comedy club, share a funny story, goof around with children or even go to [laughter yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter_yoga). Laughter gets you out of your head and away from your troubles, helps you forget judgments, criticisms, and doubts giving you a more enjoyable life.\n\n## Health Side Effects of Laughter\n\nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/wikb28.jpg\n\n**Blood pressure:** People who laugh on a regular basis tend to have a lower standing blood pressure. Blood pressure increases after a good laugh, but then it decreases to levels below normal.\n\n**Stress related hormones:** Epinephrine, cortisol, dopamine, and growth hormone are neuro-endocrine hormones associated with stress, these are all reduced after a healthy laugh.\n\n**Immunity**: According to clinical studies by Lee Berk at Loma Linda University laughter strengthens the immune system by increasing infection-fighting antibodies. Reference: American Journal of the Medical Sciences, vol.298 no.6, 1989.\n\n**Brain function:** Laughter enhances learning by stimulating both sides of the brain, which keeps the brain alert and allows for better retention of information.\n\n**Pain management**: In 1987, Texas Tech psychologist Rosemary Cogan used the discomfort of a pressure cuff to test the medical benefits of laughter on pain management. Participants who watched a 20-minute routine from comedian Lily Tomlin could tolerate a tighter cuff than those that watched an informational tape or none at all. It seems that laughter allows someone to \u201cforget\u201d about pains (to a degree) such as aches and arthritis. Reference: Journal of Behavioral Medicine. 10:139-144.\n\n**Respiration:** Like \u201cdeep-breathing\u201d laughter empties your lungs of more air than it takes in creating a cleansing effect, and sends more oxygen-enriched blood and nutrients throughout the body.\n\n**Heart health:** According to a [study](http://www.wellnessresources.com/studies/laughter_improves_blood_flow) by the University of Maryland Medical Center laughter helps blood flow by creating a 30% - 50% expansion of blood vessels. These blood vessels are your front line in determining the health of your arteries. When constricted blood pressure rises and inflammation induces damage, setting the stage for plaque accumulation. Also, it was found that people without heart disease are 40% more likely to laugh than those with heart disease (tested in a variety of situations).\n\n**A great workout:** William Fry, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at Stanford University believes that one minute of laughter is equal to ten minutes on the rowing machine. Equivalent to \u201cinternal jogging\u201d laughter can provide an abdominal, facial, and back muscle conditioning effect, great for people that cannot perform physical exercise.\n\nStudies also show that an atmosphere of humor results in better patient care and shorter hospital stays.\n\n## Other Interesting Laughter Facts\n\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/rs5z7n.jpg\n\nWe start laughing as babies at about the age of 4 months, as children we laugh an average of 300 times a day, and then it decreases to an average of 17 times a day as an adult. It seems we laugh less as we age, because adults between the ages of 18 to 34 report laughing the most.\n\nThere\u2019s also a difference in how we laugh, according to men it\u2019s a chuckle most of the time, whereas for women it\u2019s more of the giggling type of laugh most of the time.\n\nMost of the laughter we experience comes from spending time with friends, co-workers and family, in groups, not from hearing jokes. Maybe this is because laughter can be contagious.\n\nLaughter can also make you more attractive to the opposite sex, and it\u2019s speculated that it might help inhibit the fight or flight response, making it a behavioral sign of trust. In other words, make that potential mate laugh and they\u2019ll be less likely to run away :)\n\nBecause the sound of laughter is so common and familiar some researchers believe it may have helped our ancestors bond. In fact, the sound can even be recognized if played backwards.\n\nFor some funny jokes visit:\nhttp://www.laughfactory.com/jokes\n\nMay you day be filled with health giving laughter.",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>When I broke up with my girlfriend last year, she moved out and I stayed in the flat we had shared for two years.</p>\n<p>We didn't have any kids. But we had three (3!) cats and a patio full of plants. She took the cats and I got the plants.</p>\n<p>I had never been very fond of those plants. First of all, because they were not ours. They are the plants of our landlord. They simply left it there for us to take care and I considered these as intruders and as a burden. My girlfriend didn't see them that way.</p>\n<p>I think my feeling comes from my childhood. I grew up in a big house, surrounded by three big lawns. As soon as I was in age to help my father, I was enlisted to mow the lawns... And I hated it. And I promised myself I would have a house without any plant, without any lawn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Go figure...</p>\n<p>So now, 15 years later, here I am, in a flat with a patio which looks like a green jungle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My first decision, as soon as my ex-girlfriend had moved out, was to move all the plants out of the flat and to send them where they belonged: in the patio. I guess this decision was made because the invasion of plants was all her decision. I had no say in it. I just accepted it tacitly, without enthusiasm, but without complaints, in order to avoid a conflict.</p>\n<p>However, one plant got away from my drastic measure: it was a kind of ivy plant, and, I don't know why, I found it added something to the bathroom. Or maybe the humidity in the bathroom made it very easy to sustain and take care of. So I left it there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/9412fv139/IMG_20160826_200921.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>Months passed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each day, going and coming back from work, I passed by my patio and barely gave a thought to it. Nothing more than \"tomorrow I will water it\" or \"I should really clean it next week\". But I did nothing. Because I had never done anything o. I helped my ex when she asked me to, but I had never taken any intiative.</p>\n<p>I did not even notice that some plants were slowly dying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At least, the plant in my bathroom was thriving. After 6 months, it was still going stronger and greener. I discovered that I was proud of it. I discovered that I spent more and more time every week looking at it and watering it.</p>\n<p>It was a kind of guilty pleasure to see it when I came out of the shower and to see its lush green. It felt like a friend, a companion.</p>\n<p>But then something happened. And it started to decay (I blame the fertilizer which I had bought). It just died and my bathroom never looked so empty and dull and white.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I realized that I missed this plant.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I went to my patio, looking for a replacement.</p>\n<p>But I didn't look what I saw : it was too late for quite a lot of plants. By lack of water, or lack of care, some were beyong any help. They were dry and dead and all was left was to throw them away.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A few others were in the last throes. I made sure to water them at regular intervals. It became a routine.</p>\n<p>Some have been saved, some were beyond saving, but my patio has come back from the brink of desertification.</p>\n<p>And I kind of like it.</p>\n<p>I would not have thought it possible to like gardening, but I realize now why people love plants. I realize how plants can help overcome the daily grind of life or help get over difficulties, like breakups.</p>\n<p>Plants can be more than decoration. Plants can be friends, familiar faces which welcome and greet you, friends you care for and you devote yourself to.</p>\n<p>I'm now trying to reconstruct my little patio. As you can see below, the aloe vera is still going stroing and some plants have grown some new leaves, with a brighter shade of green :&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/g29rzjolh/IMG_20160826_201136.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/lmm9a6ngl/IMG_20160826_201056.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/86z8kqeyt/IMG_20160826_201101.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I found it quite comforting to see that I could bring back from the dead some flowers and some plants which looked like dead, like the one right above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I found some wild species of palms and transplanted it into pots left vacant in my patio. I monitor them carefully. For the moment they look like the jaws of thin spotted lizards :&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/ofavggyf9/IMG_20160826_201029.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>As for my bathroom, I transplanted another kind of ivy into the same pot. It will take time for it to grow to the same size as my previous friend, but i know that if i'm conscientious and careful and regular enough, I will soon have a new plant to light up my bathroom and my mornings :&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/5vwl2teth/IMG_20160826_200856.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>That's all I needed to say. Sometimes you must listen to all the lessons life has to offer, how modest they are. I listened.</p>\n</html>",

We think what we want and when we want ? Wait , do not rush to answer . Think thought , think about what you think and how to think . Someone may ask : \" I am free of my mind , my thoughts submit to my will .\" . It will be ? \n\nThe French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre defended one of the smartest theses of philosophy: man is condemned to be free. Sartre was right or was naively romantic to defend this thesis? Are we free of ourselves?\n\nIf we look at the external behavior, there is no doubt that Sartre was right. An inmate may have his body confined behind bars, but your mind is free to think, fantasize, to dream, to imagine. If your self is not trained to reflect on your mistakes, the punishment will not be in any way educational. On the contrary, phenomena that build thoughts chains will make a multi-focal reading memory over days, months and years, building mental images of escape tunnels, shortening of the sentence; in short, everything to escape a worse prison than the physical prison: the prison of anguish, boredom, the stifling anxiety. Who built prisons throughout history did not study the process of building thoughts, did not understand that the mind can never be imprisoned.\n\nWhy dictators, however brutal they are, no matter how much control their people with an iron hand, fall? Because no one can control the movement of the self and its desires for freedom.\n\nA baby will want to leave the mother's arms to explore the environment. A teenager will risk making new friends, even if it is shy. A person marked by a phobia departs from the phobic object; finally, will meet his freedom. From this angle, Sartre was exactly right: man is condemned to be free.\n\nHis thesis founded, including civil rights and duties of citizens in democratic societies. In them, we have the freedom to express our thoughts to come and go. But if, on the one hand, we yearn desperately to be free, secondly, to observe closely the process of building thoughts and sophisticated traps within it, we see that Sartre's thesis is naive and romantic. Unfortunately, we are not free as we would like to be in the intellect of the heart. In fact, the worst prisons, the worst dungeons, the tightest handcuffs may be within us. Let's see.\n\n<b>The Self is hostage to a database</b>\n\nWe build thoughts from the body of information filed in our memory. All ideas, creativity and imagination are born of marriage between a stimulus and the reading of the memory, which operates in thousandths seconds. The I not aware that reading and organization of data at high speed that occurs in the mind scenes, only the final product staged on the stage, that is, thoughts already developed.\n\nA frame, the characters of the movie or a book, however unusual they are, was gestated based on the reading of elements contained in the author memory. And memory is a product of our genetic makeup, the mother's womb, the social environment, the educational environment and the relationships of our self with the mind itself.\n\nThousands of experiences that are part of our early childhood database, such as rejections, losses, setbacks, fears were produced without that we could control them, filter them, reject them. Of course today, as adults, we make choices, take actions, but our choices are guided by the database we already have, and therefore our freedom is not full as Sartre thought.\n\nA man who may be the greatest educator of history, saw this limitation clear and haunting way. When he was dying on the cross for more than 2000 years, he said something surprising: \"Father, forgive them, they do not know what they do.\" A nonreligious analysis, but psychological and sociological, shows that the statement carries an unprecedented altruism. But at the same time, it seems unacceptable his attitudes to protect the executioners.\n\nThe Roman soldiers knew what they were doing, fulfilled the damning piece of Pilate. However, for the master of masters, the thoughts that they were built on the one hand, the result of free choice, and secondly, the basis of hostage data from your memory, tyrannical culture of the Roman Empire. Fulfilled orders, were not completely autonomous or the owners own destiny. They were prisoners of their past, \"slaves\" of their culture.\n\nCulture is the foundation for the identity of a people, but if it prevents us from putting ourselves in the other and think before reacting, it is enslaving. For the master of Galilee, behind a person who hurts, there is always an injured person. This does not solve the problem of their opponents, but solved his problem. Protect his mind. I did not carry his follies and aggressiveness that does not belong to him. The tolerance relieved, even when the world collapsed on him.\n\n\n<b>The I may be overwhelmed by the phenomenon auto-flux</b>\n\nWe do not cease to be free just because we are prisoners of our past, \"freedom limited to an existential story.\" Even within this database, we do not have full freedom of choice, as Sartre thought.\n\nImagine that we have millions of \"bricks\" in our memory, which arise from the gene pool, the relationship with parents, siblings, friends, experiences at school, information books, the process of introspection. There is no doubt that we have freedom of choice to use these bricks and build emotions and thoughts at the pleasure of the self, thoughts accusing, speeches, analyze, welcome, criticize, accept, love, hate.\n\nUnless someone is in psychotic break or under intense effect of a drug, or an unfit child to be aware of their actions, the exercise to choose and use the memory bricks are preserved. But despite the freedom that I have to access and use information to build chains of thoughts under their responsibility, there are unconscious phenomena that build thoughts and emotions without your permission. If these phenomena do exist, it dramatically changes our understanding of who we are, Homo sapiens.\n\nYou enter an aircraft knowing that there is a terrorist on board who could master the pilot and the plane to plummet? I asked this question to an audience of doctors. Of course, all said no. Then I asked, \"Who likes to suffer, to grieve?\". Fortunately, there was no present masochist. I continued, \"Who suffers in advance?\". Almost everyone in the audience demonstrated. Then I explained that if we regard the human mind as the most complex aircraft and the pilot, I, mental aircraft of them would be in free fall. I told them that \"if I you is not a masochist, if no one hates or seeks to mutilate, why then suffer in advance? If it is not I that produces these disturbing thoughts, those who produce them? The conclusion is that there is a 'terrorist' on board, there is a copilot sabotaging mental aircraft. \"\n\nWho is this copilot? I call auto-flux. Later, we will investigate it in detail, but in advance I say that such unconscious phenomenon is of vital importance to the human psyche, for creativity and for the pleasure of living, but may lose its healthy function and pass to terrify us. In fact, he is largely responsible for producing the Accelerated Thought Syndrome.\n\nDoctors began, finally, to understand that the thesis of Jean-Paul Sartre did not hold. Our Self is free to think, to organize the data in your memory, but at the same time, there are unconscious phenomena, which until then had not been studied by other theorists, producing thoughts without the authorization of the Self and that can sabotage it does, enslave him, imprison him.\n\n\nWe can not say that we are condemned to be free. We are not alone in mental aircraft ... We can and should be educated to be authors of our history, but this freedom is won and has its limits. The history of humanity, with its many injustices and atrocities, is a clear example of this.\n\n<b>The RAM phenomenon dominates memory and the I.</b>\n\nThe third element of questioning Sartre's thesis is linked to the limitations of the self as the archive memory. In computers, we are gods, we record what we want and when we want, but in human memory that is impossible. The record of all we contact is automatic and involuntary, produced by an unconscious phenomenon called Automatic Memory Register (RAM).\n\nNot just what our I want to be archived, but also what he hates and despises. All that most hate or reject will be recorded with greater power, forming traumatic windows, I call killer. If you hate someone, make sure he will sleep with you and spoil your sleep. So if I, which is the ability to choose, is not free to avoid the registration of our disturbing thoughts and stressful stimuli that we cover, how can we say that man is condemned to be free?\n\nStudy and understand these unconscious phenomena not just leave us stunned, but will also lead to a new understanding of the science of education, psychology, psychiatry, sociology and sociopolitical relations.\n\nThe process of building thoughts and all its psychological and sociological implications have not been systematically studied by brilliant thinkers as Freud, Jung, Roger Skinner, Piaget, Vygotsky, Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Hegel, Kant, Descartes, among others.\n\nThe great theoreticians of psychology and philosophy have used the thinking ready to produce, with brilliance, knowledge about the process of personality formation, the learning process, ethics, sociopolitical relations, but little investigated one that can be considered the last frontier science: the very thought.\n\nOver more than three decades, thoroughly studied this area and developed the theory of Multifocal Intelligence. I thought day and night, year after year, analyzing and writing about the nature, types, limits and the process of building thoughts.\n\nThis trajectory not leveraged my pride; instead, put me in touch with my ills and my smallness, because it made me realize in psychotherapy sessions and psychiatric consultations, all patients were as complex as the most cultured and rational human beings. Study the dynamics, the construction and movement of fully thoughts left me convinced that each patient, more fragmented that was his personality, had the same dignity as me.\n\nWe have the custom to qualify in black and white, rich and miserable, celebrities and anonymous, intellectuals and illiterates, kings and subjects, because we stand on the surface of the psychic world, because we know no more than the anteroom of the phenomena that weave us as Homo sapiens. We are a sick kind that little has honored the art of thinking.\n\nThe fact that the most complex of all phenomena of intellect, thought to have been very little investigation brought very serious consequences for the development of our species. Thinking thinking systematically leads us to break the prison of our truths and opens a universe of possibilities to understand who we are. And also to understand that the construction edit thought a high frequency leads to the evil of the century, an unprecedented brain wear.\n\n<b>Einstein's error and other consequences</b>\n\nFor not having studied the process of building thoughts, their types and their nature not developed tools for the I be a psychic manager, which led to some distressing paradoxes. Let's see. We are at the height of medicine and psychiatry, but have never been so sick.\n\nA recent study of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan shows that, over a lifetime, one in two people should develop a psychiatric disorder, ie, more than 3 billion people. We are in the leisure industry's heyday, but there has never been a generation so sad and depressed like ours. We are in the era of knowledge, information democratization, but never produce so many repeaters of information rather than thinkers.\n\nAnd the paradoxes do not stop there. For not having investigated the fundamental phenomenon that makes us thinking beings, we experience today blunders and very serious sustainability of human relations, including social inclusion. What is the difference between a person psychotic break and an intellectual?\n\nThere were differences between the great Einstein and the psychotic son he interned in a mental hospital and never visited? There were some differences in the thinking organization, the parameters of reality, in the depth of the ideas in the imagination of the formatting, but behind the scenes of the mind, they were exactly the same.\n\nEinstein's son could build illogical thoughts and mental images disconnected from reality, but the performance of self and the unconscious phenomena that built these thoughts and images was exactly the same as Einstein used to produce a sophisticated theory of relativity. Redeem a verb out of billions of options and use it in a chain of thought, even illogical, equivalent to shoot the moon and hit a fly.\n\nThe very rapid reading of memory and use of data that financed the bizarre characters and persecutory ideas Einstein's son, I repeat, not far were less complex than those of his father. However, the gloomy environment of a mental hospital, the difficulties of dealing with the child's reasoning without logical parameters and Einstein's impotence feeling led the man who most met the forces of the physical universe to be suffocated by the forces of a more complex universe, the psychic.\n\nWhen we study the process of building thoughts, we are enlightened to understand that madness and rationality are closer to each other than we think. Therefore, an intelligent person never discriminate or decreases others.",

The sets were bad, there were only a few hours a day of programming and it was mostly propaganda anyway. Romania was generally worse than other countries in this respect, and people closer to the border got special antennas to catch Bulgarian stations.\n\n\nLike all kids I liked cartoons, and it was a great tragedy in my young mind when my parents picked me up from kindergarten in the middle of the *only daily cartoon shown* \u2013 if I remember correctly something with a girl call Heidi, and I frequently missed the ending of the episode. Also there was something Russian with a wolf and rabbit. We had a VCR and a couple of cassettes with cartoons which I must have seen *100 times.*\n\n<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c4/Nu_pogodi_by_vjacheslav_kotenochkin.jpg</center>\n<center>BC: Before Cartoon Network</center>\n\nAfter communism ended, things did not change instantly. But one day, coming back from school, I entered the house and noticed an unfamiliar large, black shape - **a brand new TV set**, a Panasonic, and maybe nothing special by most standards of the time, but it was AMAZING for me. And it had cable. With **Cartoon Network**. It quite blew my mind. Cartoons, all sorts, all day. As long as my parents allowed watching that is.\n \nThe first cartoon I watched was *Birdman*, followed by everything else shown on Cartoon Network in the early 90s. Everything. There was still some drama. My parents watched the nightly news on the TV, right when **Top Cat** was on, which I loved as a kid. And I learned a lot of English watching Top Cat and the gang \u2013 unlike the Tom & Jerry cartoons on my VCR tapes.\n\n<center>http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/cartoonnetwork/images/c/ca/Birdman_energy_shield.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130627015218</center>\n\nYou see, *there was no dubbing or subtitles*. I had some knowledge of English \u2013 my parents got me a tutor in first grade that actually taught me a lot, and there was some in school. I still didn\u2019t understand everything. But I didn\u2019t need to. Just having cartoons was so great, nothing else mattered. And I watched and I watched.  \n\nAnd slowly, I started understanding more and more. Episodes tended to repeat on Cartoon Network, but for me it was quit alright, I liked them and I understood better as each month passed. Each and every episode *more words made sens, more phrases*. This is important, as phrases often have cultural meaning and just knowing what the words mean is not enough.  *Sticks and stones* does not mean stick and stones, *paying the piper* does not involve singers and currency. I was not alone in that. A lot of Romanian kids were like me. And it led to pretty good English for my generation.\n\nIt was a pretty organic form of learning, and it had a good effect on verbal skills. Sure we learned English and French grammar in schools, but for many knowing words and rules is easy, using them fluently in conversation is not. When you know a language, conversation flows, you do not need to think of the rules. I was never fluent in French, though I learned words and verbs and conjugation. They just didn\u2019t come together when I needed them. In English, on the other hand, I never really thought of the rules. If it sounded right, it probably was.\n\nI am the same with my native Romanian. I am not sure I can name all the rules and grammar; I did not learn the language by rules. I learned by hearing and talking. And the same applies in English, which helped a lot.\n\n<center>http://swatkats.info/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/02/swat-kats.jpg</center>\n<center>The cool stuff </center>\n\nMy generation talked a lot in what we called *romglish*, Romanian peppered with English words. There were nationalist politicians that wanted to ban English words in advertising, to somehow *preserve the purity of the language*. Hell, there still are in several countries. But, for us, in a country with a native language that is, to be frank, useless internationally, learning English was a huge help. Most of people my age use it daily in their work; use it on vacation or watching movies, reading books not translated in Romanian, and more. And many of us hold a debt of gratitude to Cartoon Network.\n\nCartoon Network is dubbed these days. I can understand why, but I still think it is a damn shame. Kids these days take cartoons for granted and maybe do not have the patience to watch a language they do not understand. Or maybe they do, if they were left at it, but the parents try too hard to make it easy on them. Who knows? Off course with internet, they have ample opportunity to learn English. But as they still spend the time to watch cartoons, wouldn\u2019t hurt to have some extra practice, hearing the language young and trying to understand. A bit of struggle grasping it might even help. Who knows?\n\nPoint is, they don\u2019t make em like they used to. And they are badly dubbed, which takes half the fun away.",

    "body": "<html>\n<blockquote>Yuri Gagarin is no longer with us.</blockquote>\n<p>A phone call summoned me to the press room in the middle of the night. I could tell by the editor's voice that it was something bad. I rushed out to my car, then hurried up the stairs and along the deserted corridor. The presses were still, but everyone who had been on duty that night had stayed on. The editor was speaking on the phone.</p>\n<blockquote>\"No. There's no hope. He was killed,\" he said and hung up.</blockquote>\n<p>How? Where? What had happened? Perhaps it was all a mistake? We sat around in silence, staring dully at the big clock, watching the movement of the large black hands. I heard the news again over the car radio that morning. It was news one simply did not want to believe.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/n6x0q7v6x/remember_gagarin.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p>I first heard the name Gagarin seven years before as I was driving along one morning. People were standing around in groups on the street. Some of them asked me to stop and open the car door so that they could hear the broadcast. What exactly had that young man from Gzhatsk done? Then it was ten o'clock of another spring morning, and the name coming over the radio was the same: Yuri Gagarin. Again I was asked to stop my car and turn the volume up. And the same questions were asked: What? Where? How had it happened?</p>\n<p>People all over learned that Yuri Gagarin was dead. Everyone knows that life does not only consist of good news. But Gagarin ... It was impossible.</p>\n<p>The piles of telegrams in the press room were growing. The music coming over the air wrenched your heart, while the sparrows fluttering in the puddles and the starlings singing seemed jarringly out of place. There is not a home in the country in which the people did not heave a sigh or shed a tear. The man who is no longer with us was a part of something very big that unites us all.</p>\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/u6inf5nev/leonov.jpg\"></div>\n<p>He was a Russian, and every Russian was proud, seeing in him the finest traits of his nation. Yet, he was the son of all people, of Georgians, Latvians, Frenchmen, Arabs and Uzbeks. All were equally proud of him, because he was a Man and thus represented all of mankind in its first step into the unknown. We who live in the USSR had a right to be doubly proud, for he was a Soviet man, the embodiment of the best qualities of a Soviet person. The world, as it looked into his face, actually had a good look at all Soviet people. That meant it gained a better understanding of us all. His smile expressed the spirit of his people. His cause was the cause of his people. That was why Gagarin's name captivated the world so quickly, and that is why there is not a single home on Earth where the sorrow of our loss is not shared today.</p>\n<p>So much has been said about the cause to which he devoted his life that there is no need to repeat the events of his starry hour that morning of April 12, 1961, nor of what has become possible and understandable, too, as a result. Ships ply the Atlantic. So much of importance has happened on these perilous sea routes in the last five hundred years. Yet, when we speak of America we first recall Columbus, the discoverer of the New World. Gagarin's place in history will be the same. People will become accustomed to his name appearing together with those of Columbus and Magellan.</p>\n<p>We shall name new streets in his honor, we shall probably name a city after him, and it will be worthy of his name. We shall erect a monument to him made of the most lasting metals, this for the people of tomorrow. But only yesterday we still knew Yuri Gagarin, the living man. We knew his manner of speaking, his smile. Someone had seen him pulling on his flying helmet for the last time before climbing into the cockpit. His wife remembers his last words to her. Someone received a letter from him yesterday, while another might still be in the mails.</p>\n<p>He was a good man. I saw him on numerous occasions and was friendly with him. I recall the trim major running down the wooden staircase in the house on the bank of the Volga the day after his spaceship landed. I recall the joy and surprise on the major's face as he looked at the first pictures in the newspapers.</p>\n<p>Seven years of fame did not change Gagarin. Many did not suspect the hard lot that had fallen to him. There was his work, his family, his studies and being always in the limelight. There was the insatiable interest people took in him and which was so often exhausting. Gagarin carried this weight honorably and with dignity, as a true man and a Communist. He could not always reply to all requests in the affirmative. He often had to say \"no\" to us newspapermen, too, but he always did this tactfully and kindly. He could speak equally well to the Queen of England and to an old peasant woman who, I recall, recognized him on the road near Yaroslavl and came over, crossing herself, \"<em>to have a look at Gagarin</em>\". His winning smile of a good-natured Russian man was a great aid to him. In watching him I could never help wondering at the wisdom of the choice that had been made in April 1961.</p>\n<p>Another reason we all feel so close to Gagarin is that in the thirty-odd years of his life we shared a common lot. This meant a childhood of meager rations, patched clothes and studying by the light of a kerosene lamp, and growing up in the postwar years, when young Komsomol members led a busy and exciting life, helping to rebuild the war-ravaged country. This meant a maturity in which one's convictions made a man a Communist. Gagarin was one of us. This explains the sincerity of our love for him and the sincerity of our grief as we stand with bared heads at his grave.</p>\n<p>He died in a plane crash. He who had braved the risk and danger of a space flight seven years ago returned to the earth unscathed. What, then, could possibly happen to him on the ground or even a bit higher? This was what so many probably thought and what Gagarin himself probably thought. Perhaps that is why we feel somehow guilty today. Could we have in some way prevented his death? Then again, knowing that a person can be killed on an icy street, which of us will stay at home on a frosty day? You can't fence yourself in. A man cannot let himself be swathed in the cotton of overprotection, no matter how precious his life may be to others. Gagarin, above all, did not want to change his ways, and this could not be disregarded. He was constantly in the air and spoke of new flights. Had anyone the right to forbid him this?</p>\n<p>Our loss is great. Yet, as in time of war the death of our comrades added new strength to the survivors, today our grief will not stop our forward movement.</p>\n<h2>And may the fine name YURI GAGARIN shine on forever, serving as an example to us always.</h2>\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><hr><strong><a href=\"https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@peskov/lenin-prize-awarded-writer-journalist-photographer-traveller-and-ecologist-vasily-peskov-a-soviet-journalist-s-travels\">Vasily Peskov</a></strong></div>\n</html>",

Nothing sensational, only the facts.**\n\nI am grateful to see that the robinhoodwhale was able to come to live based on watching the trail and errors by other Authors featuring over the past few months.  The group actually used their time productively and came up with the robinhoodwhale initiative, another solution helping new authors to stay active on this platform.  Will this system be flawless, only time will tell? \n\nHere are the behind the scene info for the sensation seekers:\n----------------------------------\nAbout 3 months ago my ex gavvet told me about steemit, well I thought, \u201cok\u201d it is one of those wonderful ideas of his again which will soak up all his time and get him nowhere.  Nothing new after knowing the man for 26 years.  Then 2 months ago my 19-year-old son came with the proof that steemit actually works for real, after I told him to stop wasting his time and rather concentrate on studying and getting a real job/life of course. \n\nhttp://i1253.photobucket.com/albums/hh582/crazymumzysa/Motivator%20-%20Problem%20Solving_zps05amrz6a.jpg\n[Image Credit](Motivator%20-%20Problem%20Solving_zps05amrz6a.jpg)\n\nBoth him and his dad approached the dilemma steemit was facing of good authors not being recognized by implementing 2 very different ways of getting the unknown Authors articles noticed.   Still very skeptical I took a look and sat educating myself reading most of the incoming articles each day for two weeks.  It saddened me to see how many authors poured their hearts out in so many articles not receiving a dime as a reward for their effort.\n\nKnowing I was out of my league, firstly because English is my second language and secondly creative writing was never my forte, I approached the big ocean of steemit which was intimidating as it was growing by a 1000 new members per day at that time.   I decided that I would also like to be part of this team, giving more authors exposure and that was my main aim thus far. \n\nhttp://i1253.photobucket.com/albums/hh582/crazymumzysa/e61b87f7ae616828e7694a06908eddcc_zpsfdxbdn4q.jpg\n[Image Credit](e61b87f7ae616828e7694a06908eddcc_zpsfdxbdn4q.jpg)\n\nYes, my setup was filled with flaws due to lack of time as a mother of 4 children available to spend on steemit.  I tried to avoid featuring plagiarized material by taking paragraphs from these authors articles and googling it, I knew it wasn\u2019t enough but that was the only tool I had unfortunately.  Well, I got burnt, not only by new authors but also by those who knew better and I trusted, thinking they can become part of this team and we will be able to reach even more unknown authors.\n\nDuring these past two months I had to sit and look how my son and ex got slandered and it saddened me because no one knows the real story of gavvet and some of the authors he features, I do.  As a very protective mother and person, I often wanted to climb in and say something but it was not my call.  Today I decided to speak out. Facing being even more unpopular with gavvet as he is a very private person. (Luckily he has to forgive me because I have his children.)\n\nMy son dragonslayer109, came up with \u201cThe daily pick of hidden gems\u201d when his dad told him he must come up with his own niche to be able to get recognized.  This was his baby which he nurtured every day by sitting in front of his computer from morning till night time, scratching for good articles every day to feature.  He has to answer all the people who beg him to feature them and then still write his own article or get other Authors articles ready to feature.  He also tries to promote his authors work on the chat channels.  This takes up most of his time, daily.  Is his approach flawed?, sure he is a young man and is doing the best he can and know-how with very little experience.  Just like this site being in beta phase so is dragonslayer109.\n\nhttp://i1253.photobucket.com/albums/hh582/crazymumzysa/images%2010_zpsh9pbptlt.jpg\n[Image Credit](images%2010_zpsh9pbptlt.jpg)\n\nMy ex gavvet might have many flaws but I have always admired his charitable heart (which costs this family dearly).  Over the years he has helped many people when he couldn\u2019t even really help himself and got burnt by all of them, so much so that he has nothing today.  So if you think he is rich, you are so wrong and he won\u2019t be for quite a while even though you might think he is making a killing here on steemit.  He has a few authors that can vouch for this because they know him from church. If you think he is a fraud, go educate yourself please, because all the authors he features are real and some of them have a sad story to tell.\n\n\nThe motto of this story is:\n-----------------------------\n1) There is nothing to hide or vindictive about this family, sorry to disappoint you.\n2) Don\u2019t be too quick to judge, and before doing so go get your facts straight by educating yourself. \n3) There are still good and honest people in this world who wants to help others.\n4) One thing you must know: We do not give up this easily, there are too many counting on us.\n\n**PS: you will still probably look for ways to find fault, criticize and get your sensation for the day, at least we give some entertainment value to this site, enjoy!!!**\n\nhttp://i1253.photobucket.com/albums/hh582/crazymumzysa/e865650a48261e9696842c8064333a16%201_zpsqctrchdn.jpg\n[Image Credit](e865650a48261e9696842c8064333a16%201_zpsqctrchdn.jpg)\n\nKeep smiling, reading, writing and voting!!!",

    "body": "<a href=\"http://imgur.com/zvfty2C\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/zvfty2C.jpg?2\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nSelf-discipline is one polished standard of the modern day civilization. There are huge diversities of its implemented form. Still, self-discipline has some fundamental characteristics that one has to follow. \n\n# What Is Self Discipline? #\n\nDifferent brains have different answers about the matter, but the standard says self-discipline is the perfect approach and systematic working reflected in one\u2019s life, which directly or indirectly contributes towards positive life. \n\nThis is one important factor if a person needs his/her life to be successful. All success stories have a section to explain the self-discipline part in their life, which fueled their success saga.  Speaking on a vast scale, we all practice a loose version of self-discipline; that\u2019s why we wake at least by 7 in the morning; manage to take some breakfast by 8, & reaching office by nine. \n\nBut fine tuning this one section in your life holds the key to many success factors. \n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/BTCZiF2\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/BTCZiF2.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n# How self-discipline helps you be a better human being? #\n\nBeing a better person is always a factor of survival. If the society has to choose you over others, you must hold the torch of perfection. Being perfect is directly proportional with self-discipline. If the life has a rhythm then working out of it makes you uncomfortable thus you always stick with that. This helps a person plan his life ahead. \n\nThat\u2019s is why an ex-military man always finds time to do everything, Taking care of their family,  Getting their work and projects done or community service! Their life is on track, so they run through it very well. They have a routine but at the same time, They challenge themselves, They do work that is uplifting and uncomfortable. So they can practice that self-discipline muscle. \n\n# Tips to improve yours! #\nSpeaking broadly there are a hundred suggestions to implement self-discipline, but choosing the best fit for you is the key. Say you love weight training, charting a routine for seven days helps to plan your training session and other activities, thereby always keeping you committed and free for self and needs. \n\nA routine is critical for self-discipline. If the life has a pattern then confronting the unexpected wouldn\u2019t be an issue with you. Some activities that can help you improve self-discipline are weight training, body building, practicing martial arts, community services, yoga, and meditation. These things can be hard to do; You have to practice self-discipline to do these activities. \n\n- You require self-discipline to force yourself to do something uncomfortable.\n\n- Self-discipline is a necessary factor for your success.\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/x2MSnsk\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/x2MSnsk.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n# Focus on your self-talk #\n\nYour self-talk is so important for so many areas of your life; It's also important for self-discipline. How do you talk to yourself when you know you need to do something? How does the voice in your head convey the information to you? In a rude way? Or a nicer way? \nYou want to work on altering your self-talk, so it sufficiently motivates you to get what you need to do.\n\n- Do you focus on all the uncomfortable and bad stuff about doing something?\n- Or do you concentrate on the good things, and all the incredible benefits of doing it? \n\nChanging your focus can improve your self-discipline because if you are focusing on the good outcome, it's more likely to motivate you into doing what you don't necessarily want to do. \n\n# Myths About Self Discipline #\nYou can always watch the life of a well-established and successful person in your life zone to understand how he/she works. There might be something in their life they never miss, which helps them stay in synch with the pattern and uphold self-discipline. \n\n\"If you want something done, Ask A busy person to do it\" - Lucille Ball\n\nPeople tend to look at those people, Who manage to get everything done, and they assume the person has a perfect life, They have worked hard to maintain their self-discipline. The activities that they do every day, probably aren't very fun. They have activities they hate too. Just like you do, The only difference is they focus on the reward for that activity and they go for it anyways, even though it may be annoying or uncomfortable. \n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/RUsJumW\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/RUsJumW.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nMany people also feel that self-discipline is something you \"have\" or \"don't have\" when in reality it's a practice.\n\n*Thank you unsplash for the pretty photos*",

The *Italian Game* is my old faithful, my go to opening, my first instinctual move.\n\nOccasionally though, for some curious reason I cannot understand, my brain tells me the *Italian Game* is not to be played. Instead it chooses some random piece to move, probably from some obscure opening I am not familiar with, and I embark on a new chess journey. Stats indicate that this unplanned, irregular decision is not a wise one as my loss percentage increases. Regardless of the outcome these matches are often my favorites. They bring new setups. I get attacked in new ways. I struggle. I learn, and in turn *I become a better player*.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vc3HDwBlybwmD-6-yugr7SAgc3lX2e3ok9gjmFMhpT19_nPCSD1gLU4QDysBw2Bx7_vexkFBD6XyrbFd1D-zSxQAtPZsJ9H_d-VL4G3ygMu_GOP3yQVrQ2gcQDGZt1fmXkNABzJW4c42JIc8YriOnyROVRXqZpQmNlQ5LvUKSlDr8_mIDThBfOUhUC4YDr_Of0GPtjRDgrnvdpxYmh0nB-KvzHzulR0JvyvrLpJosrmnKFsL3TrOY5kAWPJmNSy1ukSG4snPJ2TxVSKZv_g8IV1kRsrhl6q61JWO3L8AhmAPW-VmFOu5X7wH0UAsNSMU0swmIZPpB1y4FhrzXif6JfZ4T8_0gIqU_Z-HiwLmZE5Dibhb6_dES92oKtmfTZJBKwnjuHuMMJiMVBSWXo8xzRjQrlUJcVm26RZ_Mrb2kbrccbr2sF3EbY08Aw3P7Aga-R8APts3BVY22LSH2PGjraCmMtn8QyLbtBN7hhOMAVzkBLH-9wr9K_4HraCi4nKueuNu8BsBY4r0aYAcBAbb_tKnCtYydY5dWnLUSGdBt965BdDEIhpIFIH3A-iqzDIPXWq6hOXxZwaEygxBo6OJe8tMyyCkwRBz=w950-h519-no)\n\nMy life is a bit like chess.\n---\nEach day typically follows a similar schedule that leads to similar outcomes. I get up in the morning; I get the kids fed, dressed, and off to school; I go to the coffee shop for a dose of caffeine; and then I sit down in front of the computer to get some work done. This is my opening move, and if I do not make modifications to it every now and then a sense of boredom and dullness sets in.\n\nOf course I am obligated to take care of the kids each morning, that will never change, but when listlessness begins it is time for a new game. Rather than parking myself in front of a screen all day I head out to explore something new. I go hiking through the tropical rainforest of Panama. I hit up the beach for some surf. I keep the kids out of school and spend the day searching for strange insects and creatures. I do something new, and in turn *I learn to live just a little bit better*.\n\nThe importance of taking time off from your daily routine and exposing yourself to the unfamiliar is not to be underestimated. New experiences expand your comfort zone and help to make you stronger as an individual. They can inspire you and restore your sense of vigor so that you are able to resume your daily routine with new found energy.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HISOLnyeI5T9Lq5ShUwR_Njxj3xYL4bB-AUDxcc4LJl_E4PCmY9ZTJZVUxFEeq_EAW3DaEdvQ9ZyQWvGwsiTpz9xjFNBrUqqV7GcIO9d0W3U5q-FFBpgAueI7OZPcAqbzSnUOlW2THbd1cAcQFWPYNPh1gZ77XkFw12-C3Y0A7H60vb5gyqmeiFooqWgWEVdzyAQmpuwyGm-U-ZyUiuRqdqaF2K97drtvpOo7aO8sZxmNwOOfl4jKlIbg8E734VQHZ7pyGNt-rskLSaERvGLgayUze3dGrF_cAuM7wN3N1X2HpA_seN34S_HpkzPIANNfu6XMhyEDXMX7b7CQzmCp-nttrITV88rTc-Ygu0mIapp6vf_T15Z_InotayIaAgKcDUcg3XJM7xHhOpibzMdi50a7qZK5AbCdwWqdqyXu56sESNuIsRKBflyEI4pcj-o-RavLfpF7wLxYu8MAXeCc2FVLqYl-fka4ljbjyDxkZFJTAEm9XSnlUrUuoaFjUg8a-G3G0zNdAQZoJrxgSrI7NyMPyV5qs1YNbF-AHSKp0a8WUJFXDuyq7cVSZUJHPy3fipxvaW5furCUJcTf0NsPM2ckmvM9api=w1000-h488-no)\n\nA small challenge to you.\n---\nForgo your obligations for the day and do something you have never done before - something challenging that tests your level of comfort. *Be crazy and start your game with pawn to f3.*\n\n**The choice is yours.**\n\n#comfortzonechallenge",

    "body": "You didn't really get stuck in traffic. Admit it, you're guilty of at LEAST one of these. \n\n# You were in the middle of a Walking Dead marathon. #\n\n<center>![person-801789_1280423da.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/03/person-801789_1280423da.jpg)</center>\n\nYou know the cookout was supposed to start promptly at 3, and you were supposed to bring the potato salad. But you have all of The Walking Dead, Season 5 queued up on Netflix, and you can't stop yourself from loading the next episode. And the next one. And the next one. \n\nIt's 6:00 when you finally show up at the cookout, a tub of grocery store macaroni salad in hand (who knew grocery stores sold out of potato salad on Memorial Day?) All the good food has already been eaten and the only thing left is cold hot dogs.\n\n\"Sorry I'm late,\" you apologize to the host, who's been particularly keen on you attending. \"I had to go help my Mom with...some stuff.\" Feeling a little guilty, you stay until the end and even help clean up afterwards, but secretly, you spend the entire cookout worrying about what's going to happen to Beth.\n\n# You absolutely can't stand your friend's new boyfriend. # \n\n<center>[![boy-984313_12808bdef.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/03/boy-984313_12808bdef.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/7xCUB)</center>\n\nYou were supposed to go out to the new brew pub with your best friend and her new boyfriend, but honestly, if you have to be in the same room with that douche for a full two hours, you'll probably throat punch him. You don't think you can sit through one more of his dumb college stories. Like the time he got so drunk, he woke up on the roof of the frat house, with no clue how he'd gotten there or why he was wearing a campus security uniform. Seriously, what does she see in him? He's got the intelligence of a college educated rock, and his jokes all involve various types of people walking into a bar. Plus, his cologne makes your eyes water. \n\nYou decide to text your friend and say that you're really tired and need to catch up on some sleep. But she texts you back three sad faces and says \"Logan was really looking forward to seeing you again!\" Who the fuck names their kid Logan? Then she texts you several more times until you finally consent to come--but you make sure to arrive an hour late and act really tired.\n\n# Your dealer was out of his usual hype-you-up sativa strain, so you smoked indica and now you are stuck in a fathomless think-hole on the couch. # \n\n<center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/03/man-1284515_128033950.jpg\" alt=\"man-1284515_128033950.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></center>\n\nThere's a tingling sensation every time you try to move your legs. It must be your body trying to tell you something important about cellular regeneration. If lizards can regrow their tails, why can't humans regrow severed limbs? They probably can, they just haven't figured out how yet. What's so weird is that your whole body is made of energy and everything in the universe is also energy and energy can be a wave or a particle, depending on, like, whether you're looking at it, so what if you close your eyes real tight, does that mean the very nature of everything changes? And then it snaps back to normal as soon as you open your eyes. Whoa. Closing your eyes is so intense. Everything goes, like, fractal, man. What was that thing you were supposed to do? \n\n# You sharted on the way to work. #\n\n<center>![girl-517555_1280eab9a.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/03/girl-517555_1280eab9a.jpg)</center>\nYou're running a little late, so you grab a greasy fast food biscuit on the way in to work instead of making yourself a decent breakfast. The greasy fast food biscuit does what greasy fast food biscuits always do to your intestinal tract. \n\nYou thought it was just an innocent fart, but no. It's a great big, pants-ruining shart. You have to turn the car around, drive five miles out of your way to go to Walmart, waddle inside with a flannel shirt tied around your waist and try not to let your butt cheeks rub together too much. You spend $25 on a new pair of pants and a pack of underwear, and then you wash yourself with soapy paper towels and change your clothes in the Walmart restroom, hoping to God no one walks in on you. \n\nYou throw your shitty clothes in the restroom trashcan and run back out to the car. You are 17 minutes late to work--12 minutes past the \"no one will notice\" interval. When your boss sarcastically asks if you slept through your alarm, you nod meekly and grunt something about needing to find a louder ringtone.\n\n# You accidentally glued your hand to your face. #\n\n<center>![portrait-1272199_1280a3e68.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/03/portrait-1272199_1280a3e68.jpg)</center>\n\nHow do you tell your biggest client that the real reason you're running late for your lunch meeting is that you Gorilla-glued your hand to your face while trying to fix the broken ceramic Darth Vader statue that you found for fifty cents at a garage sale? How do you tell them that you had to go to Home Depot with your hand still glued to your face to buy mineral spirits? Or that you didn't realize how difficult it would be to open a can of mineral spirits with only one hand, and you spilled it all over yourself and had to go home and take a shower?\n\nHow do you say all this without revealing the truth to your client--that you're basically a twelve-year-old trying to make it in the world of IT consulting?\n\nYou don't. You make up a story about how you got all caught up in something very professional sounding, and you hope they don't mention the huge, hand-shaped red mark covering your nose and mouth.\n\n# I love you, Steemit! #\n\nHi! My name is Leslie Starr O'Hara, but I go by Starr. I live in the mountains of North Carolina and I write fiction, satire, humor, and the odd anarchist think piece here on Steemit. Follow me if you're interested in stuff about sci-fi, writing, homeschooling, productivity, or just stuff that will make you laugh your britches off.\n\n### If you liked this post, you might also enjoy: ###\n<a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@lesliestarrohara/i-thought-he-might-be-a-serial-killer-the-truly-strange-story-of-how-i-met-my-husband-part-1\">I Thought He Might Be A Serial Killer (The Truly Strange Story of How I Met My Husband)</a>\n<a href=\"https://steemit.com/spiders/@lesliestarrohara/how-to-kill-a-spider-in-14-steps-if-you-must\">How to Kill a Spider in 14 Steps (If You Must)</a>\n<a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@lesliestarrohara/exclusive-formula-for-how-i-wrote-my-breakthrough-usd18-steemit-post\">Exclusive Formula for How I Wrote My Breakthrough $18 Steemit Post!!!</a>\n<br>\n\n### <center>Buy me bacon.</a> ###\n<center><a href='https://steempay.io/payment?&receiver=lesliestarrohara&amount=1.00&currency=SBD&callback=https://steemit.com/@lesliestarrohara'>\n<img src='https://steempay.io/media/badges/donate/badge_steem-donate--light-v1.0.png'>\n</a></center>",

I have said enough already. Reality really is just an infinite loop of successive now moments repeating, in order for a literal infinite, without beginning and without end, series of experiences. It all happens now, from pure light, and really meaning is just a joke to make it seem like something important is going on.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/EGL06\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/23/Aktivirane-na-Energiinoto-Tqlof6499.md.gif\" alt=\"Aktivirane-na-Energiinoto-Tqlof6499.md.gif\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nSo right here, right now, say the Indian classics on the nature of reality. I have seen information that says this was said by someone or people many thousands of years ago. But If I am honest with myself that occurred for me right here, right now like magic, manifesting from the pure light that supports all of creation. So one can quickly see that information is imaginary, unreal. Stories of a past and future are really just a joke and not to be taken seriously as true. Why be serious at all? Surely only slaves are serious?\n\n# **The Mind Creates What I Wish to See** #\n\nOf course I can use my mind to focus really hard on something, get lost it in, spend year or a lifetime doing something, but really that is all in a way to charge the strength of my will power so that experience I wish to see happens for me. All the while perfection is there in the background. This is this perception that sees ones existence as a hologram. This would make sense, as reality changes based on my state of being, how I think and feel.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/EK8S0\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/23/holographic-universe67287e.jpg\" alt=\"holographic-universe67287e.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nSo why get lost from perfection to begin with? Well many find it fun to invest a lifetime in pursuit, always chasing. While others, sadly the majority, are too unaware to either chase a dream or be aware of light right now. But that is creation. It allows for everything, anything. There really are no limits to expression. Be it horrific or heavenly. It just depends on being aware of what you want to see and seeing it. That is all.\n\n# **Experienced Without Meaning** #\n\nThe true nature of relative reality as it arises from the absolute reality cannot be spoken about. Or so goes my paraphrase of the famous Chinese classic the Daode Jing. Simple and true. Yet it is fun to use words to entertain my mind. \n\nThough I know it means nothing at all to be serious about a hollow sense of understanding, I can know for sure that what I experience is true *because* I'm directly experiencing it. No words needed. Words are not present at higher levels of experience anyway. So really one has to fall a long way down into separation in order to talk and find fake meaning. It is really very funny.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/EKR9a\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/23/random-word-generatorb1c79.gif\" alt=\"random-word-generatorb1c79.gif\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nSo it cannot be spoken about, yet is experienced right here, right now. If I accept fully whatever is going right now, let go of everything, just witness, then that is the first step to being free. That means no cares, no worries, no fear, no judgments of any kind. This is perfect, because really any attempt to find meaning in the program called language is a fearful judgement, at the highest level. If I am in such an intense state of joy, of bliss and peace, why would I want to take any sense of meaning seriously?\n\n\n# **Forgetting To Go Full Circle** #\n\n**What if there was not this mentally imposed idea of separation?**\n\nWell first one has to delete the idea of meaning, in everything. So everything becomes random. Everything is random anyway. Indeed for an infinite array of never repeatable experiences to arise spontaneously everything one experiences would have to be random, without meaning. If one looks closely, one can clearly see that meaning is imposed after the fact with the program of language mysteriously and rather miraculously appearing to offer a sense of order and understanding of experience. But to experience doesn\u2019t require worded meaning.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/EK9Ks\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/23/Picture1-No-credited-authora60a9.md.jpg\" alt=\"Picture1-No-credited-authora60a9.md.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nOkay, so I basically said that experience requires no words to justify itself. Well this is simple and true really. If I never learned language I would still experience. Life would still happen. Indeed, if I went to a place in China where no one spoke English, apart from having to use elaborate hand gestures to procure nourishment and shelter, life would still be happening. If presented with Chinese pictograms I would find no meaning, and likewise if I heard the language spoken. Yet I would still exist. I would still be where I have been for eternity, right here, right now as light.\n\n# **In Conclusion** #\n\n<a href=\"https://www.steemimg.com/image/EK1OZ\"><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/23/Soren-Kierkegaard-Life-Quote80d4a.jpg\" alt=\"Soren-Kierkegaard-Life-Quote80d4a.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nThough relative experience is an infinite flow of ever unfolding unique experiences, never repeated, there are conditions which are the same for all beings experiencing a body in existence. We all need food, clothing and shelter, generally. In fact it has been shown in studies that after these basic \u2018needs\u2019 are met nothing really increases ones sense of happiness and fulfillment. \n\nThis is funny, because in today\u2019s increasingly complex society it is like we find it fun to create problems to solve, when we had it perfect all along. We could live from the free water that falls from the sky that creates free food. Humans it seems rear towards lack of freedom. \n\nI remember watching a documentary a while ago about societies that all work as one big family. One such instance was in Tibet and the whole community helped grow food and build shelter and make clothes. They worked for an average of  2 hours a day per year. 2 hours a day!\n\nWe think that machines will grant us better levels of freedom, but really it is like taking the long route round, if we make it back round at all.\n\n<a href='https://postimg.org/image/694ksokl9/' target='_blank'><img src='https://s14.postimg.org/u03yasksh/9183149_f520.jpg' border='0' alt='9183149_f520'/><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://postimage.org/app.php'>\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Thanks for reading, and if you would like to see more future content from me - which will include a number of ongoing series - then be sure to Follow @onesunbeingnow**\n\n**Many Thanks, Onesun :)**",

    "body": "<a href=\"http://imgur.com/w9rmblY\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/w9rmblY.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n## Coconut oil is LIFE! It's the greatest thing on the planet I swear. I shower with it; I eat it, I sleep with it! It's so good for your body! ## \n\nMake sure to buy virgin coconut oil, because you want it as natural as possible. You don't want it to be processed.\nYou can order massive gallon and bucket containers on Amazon! It's reasonably priced and can replace almost all of your regular products. \n\n[Whole Gallon of coconut oil](http://amzn.to/2bAks5q)\n[ 54oz container](http://amzn.to/2b6e98s)\n\n\n1.  Use as a deep conditioner when your hair gets dry. (avoid the top part, Focus on the ends)\n\n2. Perfect for oil in your food, As a natural fat source. Put it in a hot pan for cooking! It has a high \"smoking\" point so that you can cook food at high temperatures. Without smoke. \n\n3. Ideal for eating straight from the container as a natural fat source. \n\n4. Use as lotion! After a shower :) It will help reduce cellulite, moisturize skin, and help lessen the appearance of scarring. \n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/wml5sAK\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wml5sAK.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n5. Put a Teaspoon in your bath water to have a nice Coconut bath!\n\n6. Make a homemade body scrub with natural bath salts and coconut oil! \n\n7.  Use Coconut oil in baking as a substitute for other oils. \n\n8. Oil pulling, Put a large amount in your mouth and swish for 10 minutes. It will naturally kill the bacteria. And remove buildup. Make sure to spit it out in the garbage; It can clog your drain.\n\n9. Use as a nighttime moisturizer to keep your skin nice and soft.\n\n10.  Use on your toast for a semi - sweet buttery flavor!\n\n11. Eating coconut oil has a lot of fat, and will give you a natural source of energy. \n\n12. Use it as a healthy natural popcorn butter!\n\n13. If you have a sore throat or a cough, swallowing some coconut oil will relax your throat and help you cut back on the coughing. \n\n14. Keep your eggs lasting longer, Apply the coconut oil to your eggs which will prevent oxygen from getting inside the egg, Which will keep them going longer, It's similar to the mineral oil trick But I think it's less effective overall. \n\n15. Make up remover! Some people use baby wipes, Which can dry out your face. You can use coconut oil to remove all of your make-up effectively up While moisturizing your face. \n\n16. Natural sunblock! It has SPF 15! So it won't work for extended periods of time outside. But it will help a bit. \n\n17. Use as Lipbalm to soften your lips! \n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/K0xLAfg\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/K0xLAfg.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n18. Perfect for shaving cream! I use it for this all the time. You just put it on while you shower, Then shave. It's nice and thick so you won't get cut. Also, moisturizes your skin at the same time!\n\n19. Use on wood surfaces as a dust preventer. It's like using lemon oil, \n\n20. Use Tea tree oil with coconut oil for a natural antibiotic for your acne issues.\n\n*Thank you morgue file for stock photos!*",

    "body": "Welcome to this series of poorly written alcoholic stories, exclusive for Steemit.\n\nDisclaimer: This story does not pick off directly where the last one left off. I've decided to embrace my inner writer and write while I feel like it. I don't want to force this into a time-line as I might lose the better memories I might have at the moment. For those who are curious this is about 2,5 years apart from the last one. I had dropped out of my third high school by that time.\nPrevious part: <a href=\"https://steemit.com/storieslikethesereallymakeyouthinkaboutwhatgoesoninlifedonttheybecauseminordrinkingisbad/@modernbukowski/alcoholic-stories-2\">Alcoholic Stories #2: New school, new house, new drinking buddy</a>\nMy introduction: <a href=\"https://steemit.com/literature/@modernbukowski/modern-day-bukowski-introduction\">Some controversal, weird experiences behind this mind</a>\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/image/6159347/man_in_suit_holding_a_whiskey_glass.jpg\n\n\"Fuck school\" is the only thing I could think off for the past few weeks, months or even years.  I can't live at my parents apartment any longer. I need to move out instantly, but I need to be able to pay the rent, buy food etc. I need a job. I'm 19, no previous work experience, unfinished high school - things are not looking good for me. Around here, Eastern Europe, the law doesn't require entry-level security officers to have an education, the only requirements were to speak the native language and have a clean past, no criminal record. Literally nothing else. So I applied into few companies and eventually one of them took me to a \"job interview\".\nhttps://media3.giphy.com/media/Tnudm5OwUTb8s/200_s.gif\nSource: Google under license to use for commercial use\n<p><h2>How a job interview shouldn't look like</h2></p>\nI arrive to right address, being nervous as hell. I'm a stocky guy, but I'm no athlete and standing at only 5'9 plus been on an extremely tight budget for past... forever, so I don't look like a guy who could become a law enforcer just based on looks. So I enter the building, secretary asks to hold on for a moment till she asks chief to come down. Chief comes, invites me into his office and tells me to sit down.. \n\n>Chief: \"Alright, you're modernbukowski, eh? Good, good..\"\nMe: \"Yes.\"\nChief: \"Okay, you speak the native language?\"\nMe: \"Yes.\"\nChief: \"Sign this document\"\n*I'm reading through the contract and signing it*\nChief: \"Alright be at the warehouse at Pineapple St 923 in 2 hours, pleasure meeting, bye.\"\n\nAnd so I left. I was baffled. <b>Stunned</b>, really. What just happened? Did I just get a job? Awesome. I head to the warehouse, pick up my uniform that's 2 sizes too large for me, because the warehouse keeper simply didn't give a damn. But I felt good, I had a job, an uniform and soon got  a call from my new boss about where I had to be.\n\nThe security company has also a discounted dorm for it's workers which works perfectly for me. I move in instantly and go meet my first object. It's in the bad side of the town, but I'm not bothered by that, I'm from another quite bad part of the town, except that I didn't speak Russian, but this town part was 90% Russian dominant. No biggie, I'll handle it.\n\nSo I go to my object and find out that it's a super huge food- and building supplies market, something like a supersized Walmart I suppose. My boss is Russian. 4 out of 5 other colleagues are also Russian and the only countryman besides me gets booted off the gig in 3 days for stealing liquor from the store and being drunk all the time. \nhttp://i1015.photobucket.com/albums/af273/Chapa37/gif/funny-gifs-security-guards-dancing.gif\nSource:goofygifs.com\n<p><h3>Moment of clarity</h3></p>\nThat's when it hit me.. They're all washed up drunks. Men with no dreams, ambitions, education, they were all just drunks. Constantly drinking in the security booth, we had huge camera systems, but we lacked the technical know-how so we pretty much just played it like a Playstation controller through trial and error. The system was new because the older 90s soviet models got finally switched out, I swear the pixel density was below 240p on the older ones.\n\nThere weren't much perks to the job to say the least, I was working absolute minimum wage and was on my feet for about 10 hours a day and 4 hours behind the cameras. My work was simple, I just had to keep eye on hot stuff such as booze and cigars and make sure everything is peaceful. And let my boss know when his boss comes to the object, because he was asleep most of the time. I can't blame him. There weren't that many thieves, but we had constant problem with local drunk Russians just being an overall problem. They noticed that I was fresh as an icicle and they sure enjoyed punking me, but I'm stubborn by nature and always fight back. I think I averaged about 3 death threats per week, but keep in mind this is not America, nobody has lawyers here or the money for them, so nobody could care less. Also the local police department absolutely hated security guards, because being invited out because of some shop thiefs was not their idea of enforcing law. Not mine either, to be honest.\n\nThe job sucked, didn't take me long to start wandering around heither hungover or drunk on my post, nobody really gave a damn. Also due to huge stress at work I'd always get hammered back at dorm. This dorm wasn't like back at in my last post, this was a strict dorm with filled men, who have msierably failed in life. Not really good drinking buddies to say the least.\n\nThe job itself, I started getting used to it. Wrestling with the locals, calling police officers, preventing major crime etc... Then I got transfered to a much smaller corner store. But there was so much more action there, constant chasing, running, getting thrown with bottles and my bad case of alcoholism just grew and grew. Living on the local minimum wage I was able to pay for the rend and minimal food, I was absolutely skinny and malnourished at some point, due to my poor financial management skills induced by yours truly, savior alcohol.\nhttp://myfamous.me/pictures/bouncer.gif\nSource: myfamous.me\n<p><h2>Outstanding work ethic</h2></p>\nBut then out of the blue I get promoted for my \u201coutstanding work ethic\u201d haha, baffled again, I become a shift supervisor at a midtown club. So I\u2019m essentially a commanding club bouncer. This was a huge increase in salary, but literally each and every single night had more wrestling than Wrestlemania from WWE does. People getting slammed, thrown, puked on, peed at\u2026 every night. Oh the good times. Getting drunk as a bouncer on your shift was the most regular thing ever, we had super good relations with bartenders, because they wanted to get drunk, we wanted to get drunk, it\u2019s a win-win, because everybody knows the club is making a bank anyway and our jobs are hard. As a club bouncer I was suited up, backed by solid team and at the hours we operated, midnight, police usually appeared within a 2 hours delay so the best we could do was just kick out problemmakers. Who eventually found their way back in, start more trouble and get kicked out again.\n<p><h2>Perks of working in a club as a bouncer</h2></p>\nThe ladies. No lie, by 3 am nine men out of ten are just border line passed out and women will find a suited bouncer a lot more attractive than the barely conscious men around them. Ladies would just ask me when my shift ends and invite me over to their place, as easy as that. \n\nOh I have so much more to write, I think this saga needs a part two, but this one's going to long. If you want to see this continued hope you to follow me :)\n\n... to be continued.\n\n<p><code>If you enjoyed this post, please </code><code><strong>FOLLOW & UPVOTE</strong></code><code> at </code><code><strong><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@modernbukowski\">@modernbukowski</a></strong></code></p>\n\nThank you for reading!",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><strong>I couldn't wait any longer to share Part 2 of my Decentralized Living series to go over raising quail for meat and eggs, because I just hatched 3! </strong>So hang onto your seats and pay attention and I'll share with you all of the information I have obtained on another quality, healthy foodsource for further getting more decentralized in your life!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MY THREE NEW BABIES</p>\n<p>So, after getting back from a perfectly awesome camping trip with friends and family, I came home to quite the surprise: <em>My Japanese Coturnix quail had hatched!</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/14075055_10207550189649443_1440898207_o.jpg?oh=81de002c8679c3489efc89e9c11a59d6&amp;oe=57BDC0D4\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\"/></p>\n<p>These little guys are about the size of half of your thumb when born and make an adorable peeping sound. When you hear a faint peep and a small hole or crack in one of their eggs, you know it's game on! However, no need to worry rushing them out of the incubator! The egg they were born in has enough nutrients to keep these little guys healthy and full for up to 72 hours after hatch!</p>\n<p>INCUBATION</p>\n<p>A Japanese Coturnix Quail takes about 14 to 17 days on average (usually 17 to 19 for me) before it begins hatching. While it is in incubation, a steady temperature of 99.1 degrees is ideal for hatching. In addition, keeping moisture in the incubator is imperative, as it weakens the shell enough for the baby to break on through to the other side. I rotate my quail eggs twice a day (once when I wake up and once when I go to bed) to ensure a good hatch. &nbsp;You have to turn them or they will grow deformed and stick to the one &nbsp;side of the egg it is laying on.&nbsp; You don't turn them the last 3 days of &nbsp;incubation, as the eggs are ultra sensitive during a period I call \"lockdown\".</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/14111604_10207550187689394_310142033_n.jpg?oh=f7b59170692d7e5bc25a9385900bce85&amp;oe=57BDF27B\" width=\"540\" height=\"960\"/></p>\n<p>BROODING</p>\n<p>After the quail is hatched, they should be transferred into a brooder. A brooder is usually a box (without cracks as drafts can kill your quail) with a heat lamp, a baby quail waterer and starter chick feed. If you don't want to get a baby waterer (a gravity waterer with a small lip so they don't drown), then you can take a deep lid, fill it with pebbles and fill it with water. I do both, and they love it!</p>\n<p>The Starter chick feed is too big of a size of crumble, so you will want to crush it with a spoon the first few days, as their digestion is delicate. I use DuMor Starter Chick Feed until they are 6 weeks old and ready for the outdoor pen. From there, a grower/finisher combined with crushed oyster shell will assure your bird grows large and has the nutrients to lay healthy eggs with a firm shell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My Brooder:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/14102004_10207550198049653_185260686_n.jpg?oh=977ff7bdb95d778e884a1fb3d088c1a8&amp;oe=57BD9B99\" width=\"540\" height=\"960\"/></p>\n<p>WAITING FOR YOUR FIRST EGG</p>\n<p>Waiting for your first egg can be an impatient experience. While Coturnix Quail are fully grown at age 6 weeks, and even start laying as early as 8 weeks, I have had quail that took 10 weeks to lay their first one. Once they get going, they can average an egg a day! Although they are 1/3 the size of a chicken egg, their nutritional quality of essential vitamins and minerals is a landslide healthier than chicken or duck eggs. For more information on this, click on <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/337189-quail-egg-nutrition/\">http://www.livestrong.com/article/337189-quail-egg-nutrition/</a> for the full breakdown. You will be surprised! Here is a picture of a fully grown adult female:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/14114643_10207550169608942_1091668370_o.jpg?oh=59b2d244732fdea0b4e93bacd41183bc&amp;oe=57BDB713\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\"/></p>\n<p>You will notice that she has black spots on her chest. &nbsp;That means she's a female and will lay eggs! Females average between 4 1/2 to 5 ounces, compared to their male counterparts (3 1/2 to 4 1/2 ounces). A male has just a tan chest, and although his shouting \"Coturnix!\" sounds cool, he is only good for breeding and meat. When pairing your quail, one male can be paired with up to 6 females! (I stick to 4 for maximum fertilization).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed the article, and if the upvotes are right, I will share my knowledge about raising pheasant, as a continuation of my original article, https://steemit.com/life/@tee-em/decentralized-living-part-1.</p>\n<p>Oh, and in parting, my pot belly pig learned how to climb onto the couch!

They don\u2019t care.\n\nIf you were to tell people how sausages are made they would probably stop eating them for a day.\n\nGet a little mad at you for ruining their precious meal.\n\nIf you took them to the factory where they make them they might stop eating them for good.\n\nPeople don\u2019t want to know about the process.\n\nThey enjoy the end product. Instant gratification. No hassle.\n\nHow come you look so good?\n\n\u201cWork out 6 times a week. Eat healthy. Track your calories if necessary. Drink enough water. Sleep well\u2026\n\n\u201cYeah yeah c\u2019mon. What\u2019s your secret? There\u2019s no way I would have the time for something like this. It has to be easier. Get me ripped NOW.\n\n\u201cWell, honestly I was just born this way. I don\u2019t even work out.\n\n\u201cAh. _**Delighted. A light smile returns back on their face.**_\n\nDid you feel that?\n\nSomebody just got a little uncomfortable. Even mad.\n\nOnly because you told them what it takes to achieve their goals.\n\nPeople will hate you if you openly talk about your sacrifices. Given they even care.\n\nWell, they probably do. They don\u2019t care about excuses but they care about somebody _**overstating**_ what it takes.\n\nThey can\u2019t fathom that it\u2019s not a simple overnight process.\n\nBut a journey they could take on as well. If they would get off their lazy mindset. If they would _**get lucky**_ and _**win some special talent**_ in god knows what kind of lotto.\n\nhttps://s5.postimg.org/vovb591rb/crossing_crossroad_businessman_fashion.jpg\n\n## Nobody sees what you do on a daily\n\nNobody sees how many books you read. Research you do. How much you learn.\n\nHow many calls you make.\n\nMeetings you take.\n\nThey don\u2019t see it.\n\nIn turn, there is no one to cheer for you.\n\nIt\u2019s a double edged sword.\n\nOn the one hand side, nobody cares how much effort you put in. On the other hand side, they won\u2019t want to believe you.\n\n## Only you can judge if you gave it all you got.\n\nPut in whatever is necessary.\n\nMade the right decisions. The right sacrifices.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if or how often you fail.\n\nYou only have to win once. And then everyone can call you an overnight success.\n\nRidiculous.\n\nBut who cares?\n\nWe\u2019re not selling hope here.\n\n### Being a super-hero is a lonely endeavor.\n\nOne where you have to take care of yourself. Remind yourself of why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. Check your own progress. Hold yourself accountable.\n\nAnd most importantly, make sure you don\u2019t regret. Be happy. Live life.\n\n## Stay awesome and don\u2019t fail to create!",

    "body": "<center>https://s13.postimg.org/el6iqplpj/frogs_1407409_1280.jpg</center> \n\nWhen comparing countries for visa rules, it's important to make a distinction between tourists visas and other, long-term visas.If you plan to only stay a couple of months, a tourist visa is usually the best idea. If you work online and get paid in cryptocurrency, most immigration departments don't know what to do with you anyway. \n\nSo what do we need to create a boundary-crossing community like steemit.city?\n\n* Multiple entry visas for all nationalities\n* Relatively cheap price for visa\n* Little government interference\n* Easy renewal procedure\n\nGetting all of these right is not an easy task. Some nationalities are banned in almost every country. These mostly consist of Middle-Eastern states and North-Korea. We can scratch the entire 'Western' world from the list, as their immigration policies are notoriously tough. Well, unless you were born in of the same Western countries of course.\n\nAfter some research, I ended up with these possible locations:\n\n### **Uruguay:**\nVery blurred rules. I read stories about people living off a tourist visa for 10 years. Little information to be found online. If anyone has more details, please share! But looks like easy to enter and stay.You can get a 90-day tourist visa and extend it by doing a visa run or going to the National Immigration Office. Sources say it costs less than $20!\n\n### **Albania:**\nA country where most nationalities can enter without too much hassle. The visa allows for a stay up to one year without applying for a Residency permit. The cost of living is relatively cheap and they have fast internet connections. Albania is enclosed in the South-Eastern part of Europe and flight connections are lacking. \n\n\n### **Cambodia:**\nCentrally located in South-East Asia, Cambodia is remarkably easy to get in to. Practically every nationality can get a visa on arrival, which is then easily extended with periods from 1 to 12 months. Price is around $300 for a year. The country has two international airports with connections to all the major hubs in Asia. \n\n\n---------------\n\nThe idea of Steemit.city came from @faddat and @rampant during their trip to Cambodia for the Steemit meetup in SE-Asia. Myself (@menta) was sold on the idea and we are now starting to make it happen. All rewards of the posts made by the @steemitcity will be used to crowdsource the project. \n\nWe chose Siem Reap, Cambodia as the location for this idea. We want to make sure everyone is able to participate. And the relaxed visa requirements make this the ideal place. Anyone can enter and stay for a couple of months. Longer periods are just as easy.\n\n\n----------------------\n\n\nFollow @steemitcity to stay up to date with the project!\n\n\n\n\n\n>Sources:\nhttp://www.anywherepanama.com/travel-guide/panama-entry-requirements\nhttp://www.countryreports.org/travel/Albania/entry.htm",

    "body": "http://samanthapfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/anger.jpg\nI feel like it's only a matter of time before I'm in trouble, destroyed and dragged back to a job situation I dislike, and am trapped in. I'm always fending for myself\n\nI don't have the support of others because they don't really see me beyond my mask. I don't let them see it, or my desperation, because that makes me vulnerable to their \"I know better than you what you need\". When in fact they impose their imperfect faulty worldview with all it's difficult and stupid consequences. \n\n**I've felt like I've had to fend for myself since 8, or 9.** School was a horrible place to be.\n\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fxMqviWn4pQ/SwOWnOZiyLI/AAAAAAAAAPw/7deO81IQOzQ/s1600/Anger+sadness.jpg\n\n<h3>It made me so fucking angry. I've been trapped - unable to assert myself, cut off from my needs. Unable to leave</h3> Choked, unable to communicate out of fear of abandonment or being attacked. It's self loathing as I have to endlessly deny myself to just get a flake of survival. It's always me alone, fighting, defensive, hypersensitive to danger. And my whole nervous system is exhausted. \n\nIt's totally shot. Frazzled. It'll grow back and recover, hopefully. \n\nhttp://cdn.mutantspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sad.jpg\n\n<h2>But I'm just sad. It's a chronic, dark sadness that never ends.</h2> A constant battle that I can't win. A loneliness that will never stop. And on top  of that there's been the day to day battles of money, survival and earning. Survival is costing me so much energy that I can't really function and work properly. 1 or 2 hours maximum. 1 article. Maybe. \n\nBut it's not coming from the soul. It's not particularly resonant because I don't think others could handle the truth. And I don't have the energy to really drive it  forward strongly. Then the sadness continues. It's not despair like it used to be. But it's just the sadness that comes with never letting go, thinking that things will never get better. They might now I've written this article. It's a process, a cathartic process.\n\n<h2>I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster with no safety bars.</h2> I'm just hanging on for dear life on the edge of a seat. The grip is slipping away, and if I ever relax, pause, let go or take it easy - I'll be flung off and die when I hit the ground. So I hold on - knowing that it won't resolve the issue, but at least I survive.\n\nI'm furious that I've been dumped in this situation - superficially I'm here. I've been provided for by the world. I've always had enough food, clothes, warmth, somewhere to live. \n\nBut it's only happened through a constant battle, a constant strain. **Nobody has seen my despair.** My inner world has been cut off, mutilated, shamed into non-existence. \n\nhttp://i43.tinypic.com/97iowk.jpg\n\nWhenever I'm on the brink of sharing it. I stop. I sense danger. \n\n<h3>I'm angry that I've been forced to wear a mask, forced to conform into a certain type of person, forced to behave in a certain way, forced to only talk about certain things.  I've had to be a nice middle-class English boy.</h3>\n\nWhenever I do something against this- there's a little policeman in my head warning me that I could/will be attacked for it. So I hold back. Shut up. Shut down - whatever it takes to survive.\n\nFending for myself is so frustrating. I can't ask for support -real support. I can't ask for  help - because others are in a much worse emotional quagmire than I am (except they're numbed out from it). I'm just trapped, fighting a battle I can never win.\n\nhttp://b0.img.mobypicture.com/0c84c1948d7b32787aa6fa565505dacc_view.jpg\n\n<h3>And nobody knows I'm struggling. Nobody knows how mad I am. </h3>Nobody knows how fucking frustrated and pissed off I am for the world for bringing me into it and then making me have to figure it all out by myself. I'm livid. But of course I could never show that.\n\n**So I hide away as a hermit.** I hide behind my writing and a computer screen. Because that way, I'm not affected by the energy of another person in front of me, shaping how and who I should be. I can talk more freely.\n\n<h2>I'd like to finally feel safe.</h2> \nhttps://thejaggedworddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/feeling-safe-800x500.jpg \nI'd like to let go of all the heavy burdens and responsibilities I feel I have. I'd like to channel all this strong passion and energy into art and writing. I'd like to create and a more open/honest world where we can be real and not need facades and masks as much. \n\nI'd like to have massive poo because all these issues are backed up, blocked and constipating my guts. I'd like to feel I can breathe properly and deeply. I'd like to not feel so choked all the time. \n\nI'd like to have enough money to stop thinking about money. It doesn't need to be much. Just enough.\n\nI'd like to finally relax - my body is so full of tension, so full of frustrations and sadness and anger. I can't move it properly. I'd like to float freely like bubbles of milk on top of coffee.\n\nI have faith it will happen. I'm a good writer.I'm intelligent. I'm emotionally in tune with my body and other people. This will all resolve itself and one day soon I'll be able to focus on other people rather than myself.\n\n<h2>But until then I'm a mad and desperate hermit that finds peace in writing.</h2>\nhttps://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mg22129595.200-1_800.jpg",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/482e37423f.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"368\"/></p>\n<p>As the world continues to awaken to the true nature of reality, the frequency of real truth gets stronger and stronger amongst the collective consciousness. The longer this journey goes on, the closer it gets to identifying the root causes of what\u2019s fundamentally wrong with today\u2019s world. While the <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/expanded-knowledge/websites/\">alternative media</a> often discusses all the things broken in the system and they ways in which the masses are controlled, we don\u2019t often talk about how we are going to go about changing it for the betterment of humanity.</p>\n<p>While this shouldn\u2019t take away from the importance of identifying problems, the truth is that problem-analysis only brings about any real difference if we are willing and able to come up with tangible solutions that are then put into action. Although there are many solutions that can be discussed,&nbsp;it seems that one thing stands out above all else when it comes to changing the world. That solution is none other than pure imagination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/4819a0ee6c.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\"/></p>\n<p>Imagination is authentic mental and physical creation. It is the manifestation of something not previously there, either by creating something new or connecting points previously disconnected. This is in direct opposition to something that is fixed or controlled, whereas the idea is already considered whole or complete, so the mind perceives that there is no more value that can be added. <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/featured/the-fallacy-of-misplaced-concreteness/\">Whole or complete concepts cease to exist</a> as areas in which the imagination can wonder.</p>\n<p>Some people might ask why is this so important when there are so many direct problems that need to be addressed. Albert Einstein best sums up the reasoning behind the importance of imagination when he was quoted as saying,</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cWe can\u2019t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p>What is so profoundly important about this statement is that it demonstrates that we have to cultivate the appropriate mindset, such as having an open and curious mind that is full of knowledge, before we can go about solving any problem. It does no good having a bunch of people ready to take action, if those <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/conspiracy/the-divide-of-the-uninformed/\">actions are misguided due to old, faulty thought patterns</a>. This only leads to dead ends, which force people to start over or even worse, become discouraged and quit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/481cde0c30.jpg\" width=\"468\" height=\"293\"/></p>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty fair to assume that the people in control know that cutting off the circulation of people to their imagination is absolutely vital to maintaining dominance. This is well documented, being that we know the people at the <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/entertainment/walt-disney-elite-occultist/\">upper echelons of power are very well versed in the occult</a>. Many are none other then <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/entertainment/a-modern-assessment-of-magick/\">black magicians</a>, who create a reality for people to buy into. The elite gain power by designing systems that benefit themselves, while the public buys in without knowing the system is against their very interests. This is rampant all over society today, as people continue to believe in systems that have little to no benefit to them.</p>\n<p>When you present a system to people which you have built and control, the last thing you want is for people to start seeing through the illusion and imagining something else. It\u2019s imperative to keep their <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/health/what-happens-to-your-life-when-you-start-thinking-outside-the-box/\">minds in a box</a>, constantly running in circles with the same thought patterns. To counter this, the black magicians make their created reality so real that they even place levers of change within the system to give the appearance that change is possible within their design. However, the reality is that the system is very much rigged in their favor, despite how&nbsp;the illusions might appear. People have simply fallen victim to believing in this reality, often uttering the phrase \u201cthat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d Though in reality, people just cannot imagine a different world, and those who&nbsp;do are seen as taboo.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/4820d211e8.jpg\" width=\"510\" height=\"510\"/></p>\n<p>However, this can change anytime we want it to. The first and most important step is for people to reconnect with this core function of imagination that is present within us all. This is our direct connection to the universe and its infinite possibility. In fact, human society wouldn\u2019t have grown into what it is today, if it were not first imagined into existence by someone.</p>\n<p>We need to literally create new systems that are not there, yet are waiting in the infinite void of all possibility to be tapped into. This means starting new ideas within your own mind and starting new systems within <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/featured/relearning-history-big-vs-small-government-debate/\">your local environment</a>. It\u2019s about creating a new monetary system for economic transactions because you know that the current monetary system isn\u2019t the only possibility. It\u2019s about building new systems of power because you know the current one is only powerful because we buy into it. This means taking direct actions to starve the beast, that is our current system, because there is the self-confidence that you can create something better. We are not dependent upon the system. We just think we are because we lack the confidence and creativity in our imagination to envision something better.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to break the mold and challenge what we originally thought to be concrete. Things are not fixed and can change at anytime. It really just comes down to our perception of reality. As I have learned from my own journey, once you start manifesting this imagination within yourself, the world around you literally starts to change and the pieces begin to fall right into place. It might not be exactly as you had planned out, but that\u2019s the entire definition of imagination, the manifestation of paths that were not previously there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/48245e440f.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"/></p>\n<p>The law of the universe is love, and imagination is the universes way of speaking to us directly. We simply have to learn how to tap into this voice and listen to it. The world is changing and the old ways are beginning not to work anymore. This makes it ever important that we envision something new and better, rather than reverting back to previous designs. We always complain about history repeating its self, yet somehow do not realize that we are simply reverting back to old ways of thinking that lack imagination.</p>\n<p>This is the foundation of all change; manifesting something new that was not previously there before. The external environment is powerless to strong imagination, no matter how developed the external controlling system is. The only thing stopping us is the limitations we place upon our own mind. However, if we can let them go, we will transcend this world and bring about something far more beautiful and just. This is something undoubtedly that we all want, now we just have to have the confidence that we can create it. There are no rules; the possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/48339ccae3.jpg\" width=\"1152\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "On August 21, 2016, overlooking the famous Tanah Lot temple on the coast of The Island Of The Gods...\n\nAfter 4.5 years of trials, tribulations, highs, lows, breakups, growth, glory, and more... \n\nI, @rok-sivante took the beautiful @nia-kningty as my wife.\n\n<center>\nhttps://s4.postimg.org/tzoiicnct/aisle2.jpg\n</center>\n\nIt had been quite the ride - from meeting shortly after my arrival in Bali, exploring ourselves & each other together through what might be called a soulmate and/or twin flame relationship, complete with its breakdowns & separation - catapulted into engagement, [following ayahuasca visions](https://steemit.com/ayahuasca/@rok-sivante/how-ayahuasca-changed-my-life-and-gave-me-the-balls-to-do-the-craziest-most-courageous-romantic-thing-of-my-life) - and another two years later, arriving on the Cendana lawn of the Pan Pacific Nirwana hotel with the people closest to us in celebration of our **official** union. \n\nIn all honesty, I hadn't arrived to Bali with any aspirations of finding love & getting married. In fact, the idea of family life had no appeal, as I was too preoccupied with selfish worldly ambitions.\n\nThankfully, life's got a way of straightening out priorities - and providing blessings difficult to imagine until one first experiences them...\n\n<center>\nhttps://s9.postimg.org/655p8qein/friends.jpg\n</center>\n\nI must confess, I was a stubborn bastard along the journey to this day.\n\nThough in all fairness, so was she. (Despite the \"Goddess\" headline, she'd confess to being a major pain in the butt at times - although aren't all women...? And surely, I give her proportionate reason to want to choke me at times.)\n\nI didn't ease into the wedding planning all that gracefully, though my resistance did dissolve the closer we came.\n\nOur original plans were for something small & simple. Though, the whole event took on a life of its own - and *thank God* it did, as it ended up magical beyond what I could have envisioned myself. \n\n<center>\nhttps://s13.postimg.org/9sqs2xzc7/magic.jpg\n</center>\n\nTrying to pull it all off as affordably as possible, we were first looking for somewhere basic. Thankfully, Nia's taste for exquisite beauty & quality standards pretty closely matches my own, and she suggested checking out Nirwana - despite my closed-mindedness and thinking it'd be way above our budget. Turned out, the location was exactly what she had in her mind - and I couldn't exactly say no, either.\n\nThere were some speed bumps, though... \n\nWe had been put on a waiting list, as there was another client inquiring about the venue for that date. After receiving confirmation we *did* get the venue, we were later informed the confirmation was revoked - and had to deal with the incompetence of two staff that belonged nowhere in a five-star resort. *But,* things got worked out. And in compensation for the mess, we were incredibly surprised and impressed to be checked into **the Presidential Suite** on the day.\n\nPimped. VERY pimped.\n\nA pretty perfect way to set the tone for the new chapter.\n\n<center>\nhttps://s13.postimg.org/cs5mucn7b/20160821_111211.jpg\nhttps://s14.postimg.org/40jv4dmr5/from_balcony.jpg\nhttps://s9.postimg.org/61ihxrsov/image.jpg\n</center>\n\nSitting on the balcony of the Presidential Suite, overlooking the waves crashing in against Bali's south coast, and sipping a scotch while listening to my own supa dope mix, [Sunset Ascensions Vol.1](https://www.mixcloud.com/RokSivante/sunset-ascensions-2016-vol1/) - it was a great space for reflection...\n\nFrom that afternoon in such an opulent accommodation, to standing on the ceremony lawn while guests arrived listening to [that same DJ mix of mine](https://www.mixcloud.com/RokSivante/sunset-ascensions-2016-vol1/) - the whole experience was of a vibration I'd only rarely dreamed of.\n\nThe last time I had soaked in that vibe was four years ago, DJing at Rock Bar - an absolutely stunning world-class luxury venue I'd set my sights on landing a residency at. There were moments looking down over the bar from the DJ booth on the cliffside as the sun set with waves crashing, that encapsulated the precise idealized experience I'd envisioned and relocated on the other side of the world to chase after - the music cradling & infusing the setting with a warm of soul, the entire setting nothing short of masterfully cinematic. And waiting for the guests and my bride-to-be arrive on the Nirwana lawn, listening my own sonic labour of love - that same vibration penetrated my being, wiping away *any* resistance there might have been left to making the next **major** commitment of my life.\n\n<center>\nhttps://s11.postimg.org/6fsz1opgz/commit.jpg\n</center>\n\nThough I'd been stressed the week leading up - mainly due to my perfectionist side concerned about the small details of the music and sound system - there surprisingly wasn't too much nervousness when the time came. No cold feet. \n\nThe other anxiety that was present was over the \"show\" aspect of it all.\n\nThe majority of attendees were Nia's father's associates, who I'd never met. Given there were only about 40 people total, it was definitely *alot* more intimate than the traditional Indonesian weddings with 500 guests. Though to be honest, I was uncomfortable with the idea of standing up in front of a bunch of strangers to share one of the most personal moments of my life.\n\nWhen the time came though, none of those concerns mattered.\n\nTotal surrender.\n\nAnd the proper focus emerged on its own...\n\n<center>\nhttps://s16.postimg.org/wpu4e6n0l/prep.jpg\n</center>\n\nAs I stood center-stage next to the priest, everyone sort of faded into the background as the music came on for the bridal entrance - Peter Gabriel's \"Book Of Love,\" which etched its way into our hearts years prior while on a mini-trip to the neighboring island, Gili Trawangan.\n\nAs the violin's in the song pentrated my eardrums, I was overcome with emotion...\n\nI couldn't see Nia *yet,* but I could *feel* her coming - and I already knew how beautiful she looked. This odd reaction took over - a loss of control, wherein I wasn't quite sure if I was going to burst out in tears or giddy laughter. \n\nI tried my best to maintain my composure in front of the guest, even as their heads were turned the other way to watch Nia's parents walk her in. But we both were unable to hold back the most playful, giddy smiles as our eyes locked while they approached.\n\n<center>\nhttps://s4.postimg.org/k5bkh8iwt/palm_tree.jpg\n</center>\n\nThis was it. Game on.\n\nI *never* believed in the \"fairy tale weddings.\"\nBut in hindsight, *this was fucking it*. The real deal.\n\nThe setting... Perfection.\nThe backdrop of the ocean & temple... Breathtaking.\n\nThe colors of the sky contrasting the greenness of the grass of the surrounding golf course, envigorating.\n\nThe magic of the moment... \nThe energy...\nThe vibe...\n\nSurreal.\n\n<center>\nhttps://s11.postimg.org/56od4158j/start.jpg\n</center>\n\nAs the ceremony proceeded, my heart pounded with a nervous excitement.\n\nAnd as beautiful as the whole thing was, my entire focus was on her.\n\nThe priests words, I can't recall. Not ever being religious, that part of it didn't resonate so deeply with me. But when it came time to our vows... WOW.\n\n<center>\nhttps://s13.postimg.org/f4z82lgrr/from_aisle.jpg\n</center>\n\nWe'd both crafted them totally unique.\n\nShe couldn't hold back her tears as I read mine.\nAnd I couldn't hold back my smiles as she read hers.\n\nPoetic, raw, deep, and touching - those were moments unlike any I've ever experienced in my life - infinitely more meaningful than I had anticipated, having been so disconnected in my preparations - only to be blown away by the pure authentic love in that present exchange.\n\n<center>\nhttps://s3.postimg.org/j9llw2ohf/panorama.jpg\n</center>\n\nSo, yada yada yada...\n\nThe \"I Do's,\" the rings, the pronounciation, the signing... Down, it all went. As though by Divine design.\n\n<center>\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/5sve4s3i9/the_kiss.jpg\n</center>\n\nWhile I'd been semi-disappointed that my cousin (who's been like a brother since we were babies) couldn't make it, and two of my closest friends from Bali didn't make it do to simultaneous attacks of serious dengue fever (a reasonable excuse, no doubt) - the event was complete in my heart, with the presence of my parents...\n\nAs we'd been planning for something simple before, there was talks of my parents not coming - saving the travel money for a wedding present instead and helping us in our move back to Canada. Thankfully, they colluded with Nia behind my back and flew over for the week. \n\nAs much as I'd eagerly ventured far from home and lost touch with the value of family and love for the two people who raised me, having them there to share the day touched my heart in a way that melts my ego. And seeing their love for Nia has brought such joy & peace to my soul, there's nothing but gratitude when I think about it.\n\n<center>\nhttps://s12.postimg.org/pdwxrnmj1/parents.jpg\n</center>\n\nMy soul-sister, @nikstarr...\n\nIt would not have been complete without. Nor would have any of it happened without. \n\nBoth her speech and my mom's over a champagne toast at dinner, brought tears to my eyes. So touched and amazed by these two amazing women - and the sharing of their stories of me & my growth, and how they've viewed my journey through their eyes - ending up at this day, for a new beginning...\n\n<center>\nhttps://s4.postimg.org/ppxuj59y5/nik.jpg\n</center>\n\nThrow in a few more amazing friends from both sides, some VIPs, an absolutely succulent buffet, and quality chats late into the evening with a circle of extraordinary ladies in the Presidential Suite...\n\nWell, the story needs to stop somewhere, as no words do it all justice.\n\n<center>*(And I was more than happy to opt-out of the usual dance routines, after having DJed a couple hundred weddings over the last year... sigh of relief!)*</center>\n\n<center>\nhttps://s15.postimg.org/togqvecnf/table.jpg\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n<h4>The moral of this story...?</h4>\n\nI dunno man. Follow your heart. Let love reign supreme. All that cliche stuff. To each their own, to fill in the blanks.\n\nI've been back & forth about whether or not to share this. But fuck it.\n\nI didn't want the spotlight in front of a bunch of strangers on that day. And I don't particularly want it now.\n\nBut there really was something magical about it all - as @mammasitta attested to in [her personal account of the day](https://steemit.com/life/@mammasitta/rok-and-nia-s-wedding-day-in-bali-and-why-i-believe-in-unconditional-love-again) and how inspirational it was for her.\n\nI dunno what it is driving me to share this most intimate of moments. Maybe some knowing that love *is* inspirational.\n\n<center>\nhttps://s14.postimg.org/pjuf1q0ep/girls_dancing.jpg\n</center>\n\nAfter all is said and done, not that much has changed.\n\nShe's always been my woman. Neither \"girlfriend\" nor \"wife\" have been or ever will be enough to do justice to the roles she fulfills in my life.\n\nNo doubt, we've been blessed, and have *alot* to be grateful for.\n\nNo doubt, we'll continue to have our challenges along the way - just as any marriage does.\n\n<center>Though, something *has* changed.</center>\n\nHaving made the commitment is alot bigger deal that just the marriage itself - it's a commitment to *life.*\n\nNo more, *one foot in, one foot out.* Now, it's *in it to win it.* And not just myself. But for the both of us. And the future family.\n\n<center>\nhttps://s3.postimg.org/ezdjzflqr/mic.jpg\n</center>\n\nI wouldn't have chosen this path if it was up to my former self. But the direction was provided. I followed. And the outcome, AMAZING.\n\nMind-boggling, the consequences of certain action steps.\n\nAnd a fascinating journey ahead, that's barely even begun...\n\n\n<center>\nhttps://s21.postimg.org/qqm2kcq6f/love_sign.jpg\n</center>\n\n<h4>photo credit to Riccardo Ulpts</h4>\n\nMany thanks for taking the time out from your usual shooting bikini & lingerie models... :-p\n\n**[www.ricc.photo](www.ricc.photo)\n[www.instagram.com/riccphoto](www.instagram.com/riccphoto)**\n\nP.s.\n\nA huge thank you to the Steemit community... your support has provided the means to make our next steps back to Canada.

    "body": "Every year millions of people get new smart phones, laptops tablets, digital cameras and other new electronic devices to replace their outdated gadgets that they bought the previous year. Most of these devices are destine for one place: Africa. \n\nFrom 2013-2017 the global volume of waste created by electronic gadgets is expected to increase by 33%. By then, the waste will be equivalent to the great pyramids of Egypt. In  2012  50m tonnes of e-waste was generated globally. This is around 7kg for every person on the planet. \n\nThe components that make up electronic devise are made of hundreds of different materials that contain toxic substances such as lead, mercury, arsenic and cadmium. Did you know that some old computer screens can contain as much as 3kg of lead?\n\nThese materials are put into landfills and the toxic substances are released into the environment and contaminate the land, water and the air. Children can be found roaming the dump sites looking for pieces of electronic waste that they can sell for the metals contained in the different parts. The people working these sites often suffer from illness due to the release of toxins in the area. \n\nThe problem of e-waste is so serious that 1 in every 3 containers leaving the EU contains illegal e-waste. The Christmas period sees an increase in sales and waste around the world. The main culprits are TVs, mobile phone and computers. These areas see the greatest technological advancements and are therefore replaced at quicker rates. \n\nE-waste does not just extend to these three gadgets, old fridges, toys and electric toothbrushes are also disposed of in the same manner. Electronic waste is now the world\u2019s fastest growing waste stream. While China generates 1.1m tonnes more than America with their 10m tonnes, there is a significant difference per capita of wastage. While the average American generates 29.5kg of e-waste, the average Chinese person\u2019s wastage is 5kg. \nIn Europe, Germany discards the most e-waste in total and Britain is the world\u2019s seventh biggest producer of e-waste with the average person discarding 21kg. \n\nIt is illegal to export discarded good to poor countries if they can be reused or refurbished. Most e-waste is shipped to Africa under false pretences and are falsely labelled as \u2018used goods\u2019. \n\nThis Christmas, when you receive or give a new electronic device and the old device is thrown out, the chances are it will help contribute to pollution in Africa. The best case scenario is that it will be picked up by a starving child so he can sell the metals in exchange for money to eat. \n\nWhile you search for Pokemon they search through your waste. \n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/833c864032.jpg",

    "body": "Laughter is one of the best ways to heal yourself.  It brings joy, releases stress, and heals us when we are the most broken.  Studies state that those who are joyful and laugh often, can live as long as 10+ yrs longer than people who let stress eat them alive, are angry, and rarely laugh.  \n\nhttp://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Baby-Laughing-Hard-and-Falls-Over.gif\n\nIn 2003 after my 8th open heart surgery, one of the doctors stopped by my room with a joke book in hand.  They were truly corny jokes, but we laughed for over an hour.  He was telling me about a study that the Mayo Clinic was doing at that time on the healing power of laughter and what that can do for those who are ill, most especially for people who suffer from chronic disorders.  It made me really re-evaluate my own life and to remember to laugh at the small things and enjoy the moments that I am given.  It's definitely something that we should reflect on.\n\nThere are many benefits to laughter, below are a few:\n\nPhysical Health Benefits:  Boosts Immunity, Lowers Stress Levels, Decrease Pain, Relaxes Your Muscles, Helps Prevent Disease\n\nMental Health Benefits: It adds joy to your life, Eases Anxiety & Fear, Relieves Stress, Improves Mood, Enhances Resilience\n\nSocial Benefits: Strengthens Relationships, Attracts People to Us, Enhances Teamwork, Promotes Bonding\n\nI am sure some of you have probably seen this video, it's made a few rounds on facebook.  It's of a person on a subway car who starts to laugh and then every begins to laugh.  Laughter is infectious.. it's truly amazing.  When I am out in public and I see someone start to laugh or giggle.. it instantly makes me smile, giggle, and then laugh.  It's amazing! \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J43xQ4dTAxY&ab_channel=BMedia\n\nSo Laugh a Little More.. and Let Laughter Heal Your Life!",

    "body": "### First, I just want to thank my parents for all of the incredible sacrifices they made for me.\n\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/XtRGWcj.jpg</center>\n\nI've always tried to do things my way, despite the fact I'm smart enough to know that learning from _other people's mistakes_ is the most preferred method of figuring out how to make your way through life.  If you make your own mistakes every single time, you're going to be dragging behind everyone else for your whole life.  This was a lesson my parents, especially my Dad, tried to impart on me time and again when I was growing up.  Of course, being the genius-level smartass I was, I thought I knew better.\n\nI treated my parents with disdain for a few years when I was a teenager, and I would give **anything** to take that back.  These are people that worked four jobs between the two of them and drove a beat-up '86 Honda Civic hatchback for five years just so I could go to kindergarten and have new clothes.  They broke themselves in half more than once to make sure I could go to a private school from third to sixth grade.  They were unceasingly patient with me even though they didn't need to be, especially once I graduated high school and really started screwing the pooch in college.  Throughout all of my nonsense, they never stopped loving me and supporting me, and they've given me every chance in the world.  I don't think I'll ever thank them enough for that.\n\n### Recently, my grandfather had a bad fall back home in Romania, and my grandmother had a stroke.\n<div class=\"pull-left\">http://i.imgur.com/PzfbIrYm.jpg\n<center><h4>My Grandfather</h4> </center>\n</div>  \nMy father has flown back and forth to Romania three times now in order to see to his mother and father, moving them into a decent assisted living home.  While my father isn't a very emotional person (compared to me, he is downright <b>stoic</b>), I know this is taking a toll on him.  Since we live on opposite ends of the United States from each other, I don't have much day-to-day interaction with him, and so I'm left in the dark with being able to gauge how he's doing.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">http://i.imgur.com/VAKqKLRm.jpg\n<center><h4>My Grandmother</h4></center></div>\n<br>\nBut more than that, it got me thinking about what life would be like once my own parents got to that point.  They're in their early 50's, so there's still years to go before that happens, but I suppose any time we're faced with the possibility of someone close to us face his or her end, it comes to mind.  I also accept that this is going to happen.  Despite what the transhumanists might like to say, death is a part of life.  Everyone that lives will eventually pass away, living on in the memories of those they leave behind.\n\n\n### What would I do without them in my life?\n\nDespite the enormous distance that separates us, I still talk to them constantly.  We tell each other about how our lives are going, we offer each other support, and we bring each other up if any of us is having a hard time.  I can't imagine what it would be like to no longer have that connection.  It feels like a big, empty hole inside of me whenever I try to picture it, and I immediately stop trying to.\n\nWhen my mother's father passed, I wasn't particularly upset by it.  I hadn't developed a very close connection with him, but with my parents?  They raised me.  I lived with them every day well into my twenties.  Aside from the thoughts of figuring out their estate and taking care of any affairs I'd need to handle when they pass, there's still the utter _lack_ of them in my life afterward.  I honestly don't know what I'd do without them.\n\nI guess I'll figure it out when that time comes.  Hopefully it won't come soon, and I hope they get to enjoy being grandparents to my daughter for many years to come.  With any luck, they can enjoy being greatgrandparents as well, and we can all sit back and chuckle about how strange kids are these days, and how things were so much different for us.  **Really and truly, I just hope I get enough chances to tell them I love them, and how much they have meant and still mean to me every day**.\n\n<center> <img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn59/Glorybound87/20160807_224529_zps75uqrq4v.jpg\"></center>\n_Andrei Chira is a vaper, voluntaryist, and all-around cool dude.

They kept talking about hacking their scooters, soccer and stuff like that, I liked more hearing about gossips and what the girls wanted from life.<br>\nThat doesn't means I'm gay, well, not totally at least. I will explain % later.</p>\n<h2>Go away shyness!</h2>\n<p>Shyness is something that was teasing me to be took away, at least for having a girlfriend. I took a couple of books about selfesteem, and learned from it.<br>\nI didn't became less shy, but at least I learned something useful for others.<br>\nI was became a selfesteem psychologist.You are right, after a couple of books you don't automatically become an expert of the subject, but believe me, at that time, when I was 13/18, it helped a lot when I had my real and internet friends. I setted my expertise of sefesteem to my customers, and after that I amplied it to use what I knew to gather more informations about who I liked.</p>\n<p>At the start it was a very difficult, because I was exposing myself too hard, but then, with more soft approaches I found out it was way better.</p>\n<h2>Is that like social engineering?</h2>\n<p>I suppose so. I was probably the best in what I was doing, not to count that in that period I was practising <strong>just for fun </strong>missions on hackthissite, such &nbsp;good old time. Registered there in 2004, it was a good period for me. Young and stupid and wanting to have challenges. At the time, I wanted to become a programmer, just because of the sake of it, not for the money, not for popularity, but for being useful somehow. I still have some of my dirty experiments for helping people to win something at the lotto. Good times.</p>\n<h2>At some point I became a talkative machine</h2>\n<p>In that time I did from one opposite, from total shyness, to a notstop talking machine, seriously, I was annoying as hell.<br>\nI was sgetting psychologically tortured as school for this. let's move on.</p>\n<h2>Sex, this unknown thing I met only a couple of times until now.</h2>\n<p>With my experience, at the age of 18, I had my first real aka physical girlfriend. Worst experience ever, well, maybe not like the time I foundout a girl I liked on the internet, when it was the time to get physical she was more blasphemous than anybody I knew. That was a strong punch in my stomach.</p>\n<p>I had sex only a couple of times until now, so I'm not the experienced guy it looks like I am, but still, I have \"enough\" experience to let the girl says I'm good in bed. Maybe I'm just natural with a gift,or it is just mother nature that after all these years made me gathered some natural expertise.</p>\n<h2>So, why are you so idiot?</h2>\n<p>Hey! I'm not so talkative anymore, I just... lose interest pretty fast, and keep changing my interests every 6 months. And that's bad for me, because I would love to keep on on an interest but bad feedbacks never pushed me to do better but made me angry and give up on that. This year I finally decided 3d modeling was one of my passion when I was 15, so I want to hunt this passion down and keep going.<br>\nYeah, that's what it stops me ususally, bad feedbacks, or the complete absense of feedbacks, which usually, happens on here aswell, that's why I have had almost the need of powering down, but just a couple of true steemit friends gave me the braveness to hold them, so thank you @repholder @noisy and @timsaid for trusting in me.<br>\n</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><em><strong>This is a story about being sucked into an emotional vortex and a lesson to take a step back and examine our immediate circumstances. I was manipulated by a woman I really trusted for twelve years. I will readily admit to being naive. As soon as I like someone I find it incredibly difficult to notice their bad points. My problem is I want everything to be comfortable and happy and can't stand confrontation and suspicions. Unfortunately this is not a good quality to have in business.</strong></em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/965xsefwb/lady_1269263_1280.jpg\" width=\"959\" height=\"1280\"/></p>\n<p>My husband and I have almost always worked for ourselves. We started our shop selling second hand goods in our early twenties and were fortunate that our business did very well initially. My husband employed an assistant I will call Leona. At that stage we had divided the shop into two separate sections, with each of us running our own section. He soon tired of Leona as he felt she spent too much time talking to the customers. As he was about to ask her to leave, my assistant resigned and I felt Leona would be better suited working for me. And she was, as there were far less people to chat to.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Everything went well, and increasingly I trusted her. I like to think I would have discovered her true nature sooner if fate didn't drop a bombshell. Her husband was employed at a local metal working factory and one day two of his colleagues arrived at my shop and escorted Leona to the hospital. Her husband had been struck in the head with a massive hanging metal winch and was not expected to&nbsp;live. He did, though he is horribly disfigured. She was off work for months while he recuperated and underwent numerous operations, almost succumbing to hospital bugs a few times.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A life changing injury has long term ramifications for the entire family and I felt that I was the only one keeping Leona sane. Years passed, but the drama never eased. I did not realise the extent of the emotional pressure I was under, as it had become part of my daily life. She and her husband had made friends with another couple, and there were explosive reports of infidelity. (She and her husband eventually ended up partner swapping!) Her son hated her, her daughter was still wetting the bed at fourteen years, her brother was an alcoholic, and the list just went on and on. She took a powdered headache medication constantly, complained of feeling sick all the time, and moaned about everything in her life. Yet, she almost never took time off. I thought she was using work to have a break from her issues. I was an idiot.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The financial crisis hit. The shop no longer did so well. Creditors withdrew their support. Everything was a struggle. And at last one of the other staff members came to me. One of my customers had spoken to her and told her that she was selling items to the customers and pocketing the cash. We have a large second hand business with a lot of ever changing stock, so stock take is almost impossible. I couldn't afford surveillance cameras so I started to watch her surreptitiously every moment that I could. I was emotionally exhausted, having been sucked into her continual emotional dramas. At last I literally saw her pocket money, so my worstnfears were confirmed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I feel ashamed, but I was too scared to confront her. Looking back, I suspect Leona's ongoing dramas were in part based on reality, but were also providing a smokescreen for constant pilfering. I learned much later that she had been let go from her previous job for suspected theft. Ironically I used the excuse of the economic downturn and retrenched Leona. Due to the length of time she had worked for me I had to pay her a full salary for another five months, at great financial cost to myself.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/zd74ocy63/drawing_1166119_1920.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1281\"/></p>\n<p>When she was gone, and out of my life at last, I felt a sense of peace that I didn't know I was lacking. I actually had to <em>recover. </em>I have since learnt more about psychopaths. http://www.sociopathicstyle.com/psychopathic-traits/ has many points pertinent to psychopaths. I can see that she was charming, manipulative, a pathological liar with no remorse or guilt. She was only emotional if things were not going her way, but had no empathy for others, including her husband and children. She had a parasitic lifestyle (\" An intentional, manipulative, selfish, and exploitative financial dependence on others as reflected in a lack of motivation, low self-discipline, and inability to begin or complete responsibilities\"), poor behaviour controls, and was probably sexually promiscuous, though she did not confide that to me, knowing I was a faithful wife.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Many years later I realised that she was a psychopath. She almost destroyed me, mentally as well as financially. When I look back, I can't believe how dark those years were. I have changed, but not as much as I should. Another long term staff member recently resigned, leaving me to pay the last couple of months on the phone contract I had taken out for her. I've never really been a person to make lots of friends. I have my husband and that is enough for me. I think that I have substituted staff members for the friend role. Fairly recently I met a wonderful friend, who doesn't subscribe to all my excuses. She points out my errors (none to gently!) and I am slowly beginning to learn not to let people take advantage of me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em><strong>Be careful of emotional laziness, it is NOT the same as kindness. Examine all the people in your life carefully, and the roles they are playing in it. Don't be naive, and as idiotic as I was, in the name of comfort, because false comfort only leads to pain. And if you find a friend that tells you \"You didn't listen, so I'm going to slap you silly first, and then help you sort your shit.\" - treasure them, even if they do hit HARD!</strong></em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/578q9kr97/bear_1332002_1280.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\"/></p>\n<p><em>(all images: pixabay)</em></p>\n<h2><strong>Thank you for reading.

If you are going to die here, you might well succumb to our crime rate. Look it up on the internet, if you need to. But our crime rate <em>pales</em> into insignificance if you dare venture onto our roads! I'm a badass, so I do. (Okay, I have to, I live here!)</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This first rule of the roads in South Africa is that there are no rules. (I can get even cheesier than that, watch my tail lights!) Unless you buy your drivers licence in South Africa, a valid option, there is a kind of informal ceremony where you toss that \"Get your Learners Easily\" onto the braai (barbeque if you must) fire, rub your hand and grin. You are ready, steady GO!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I have just begun to teach my daughter AND her boyfriend how to drive. Being the sucker for punishment that I am. We live in a large country with widely spaced towns, and almost no government public transport (see how I cleverly inserted the word \"government\" there, more on that later...). A license is ESSENTIAL for job prospects, and I'm not planning on supporting two delinquents! And God forbid, progeny!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/95pcre5mj/giraffe_1164006_1920.jpg\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1920\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We do, however, have a <em>fantastic</em> private sector transport provider. Minibus taxis! Rival gangs operate their fleets of taxis, engaging in all out warfare if their chosen routes are under threat, <em>with the passengers still in the taxis! </em>Death might happen, never boredom. Minibus taxis are the preferred, and often only, method of transport for those commuting from previous \"black areas\", a remnant from the Apartheid era, which are actually still \"black areas\". Large chunks of theses commuters (which include ALL my staff) incomes are spent on transport costs. There are bus routes. The bus companies, often government subsidised, are ready targets for attack, with bus depots and buses regularly being burnt down.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Taxis extend their lawlessness to the roads. There is NO section of road where stopping to pick up passengers is taboo. I think there is a kind of taxi credit system for the most outrageous passenger pick-up/drop of points. Personally I believe that their lawlessness has influenced us ALL in this country.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Nobody stops at an orange (amber) robot (traffic light). If you do you are a \"doos\" (Afrikaans swear word for \"pussy\"). Doesn't everybody know that there are at least 3 seconds after the robot turns red, before the robot for the other side's traffic turns green? Those are 3 seconds that should be utilised. Time management people! A four way stop should be approached in the following manner: If you are a woman, flirt. Make googly eyes and you can go first. If you are as ugly as fuck, look threatening, and that works just as well. When robots are out of order, and the rules of a four way stop come into play, this advice is particularly important. Survival of the fittest, fastest and meanest. (Or cutest.)</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Since road markings (solid or broken lines, etc) are just for decoration. People die. A lot. Our neighbour's wife died in a head-on collision. But he is married again, so no real harm done. My sisters best friend's family, including the friend, were wiped out en route to a family holiday. Okay, so that was traumatic.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/pjdxoab5n/ostriches_838976_1920.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1043\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We don't have speed limits. If you do get pulled over for an infraction, you only need to pay in Kentucky Fried Chicken and Fanta. (For the most part, so don't blame me if things go wrong, hey.) People die, it keeps the population down. Our road fatalities are up there with our crime rate. A customer asked me in the shop if my husband still traveled to auctions so regularly? He, the customer, and all round general asshole, said that statistics were not in my husband's favour. I know that. Okay. Reiterate, <em>asshole.</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We have potholes that can house entire planetary systems, never mind ecosystems. We have a kind of road rage that caused one of my customers to be beaten to death with a cricket bat in our small town. We have the kind of road rage that makes you swear off road rage forever, or risk dying in a cricket bat induced bloody heap. I'm chill, hey, so chill! One of my staff members lost two boyfriends, each one the father of one of her children, in separate taxi accidents. One <em>decapitated</em>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.io/3lhguhw57/zebra_1157459_1920.jpg\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1920\"/></p>\n<p><em>(all images: pixabay)</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>South Africa is not boring. South Africa is not for sissies. It is great to be alive in South Africa, we have the warmest, most life giving sun, I can feel it firing up my cells. We do not have to rely on lions for transport. The only zebras on our roads are <em>zebra crossings. </em>It is great every day not to die.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3><strong>Thank you for reading.

    "body": "Intimate relationships are great. If you have someone caring, loving, compassionate, courageous, loyal and trustworthy, then you could not ask for more. That\u2019s what I wanted, and That\u2019s what I never got!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fecrQZ2.jpg\n\nI was a carefree person a decade ago. Just out of university, having a specialization in Psychiatry in my hand and looking for some premises where I could start practicing. I found some decent rooms and got them furnished. I hired a receptionist and luckily through my contacts, clients started pouring in. It was an excellent practice for me. I found out people with tons of problems. Most of them were related to common forms of mental illnesses such as depression, bipolar disorder, dementia, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders presenting themselves symptomatically in ways like nervousness, social withdrawal, apathy, increased sensitivity, sleep changes, mood changes, disconnected and illogical thinking and many others. I began to learn things. Things that life may present to anyone, anytime, anywhere! But had I learnt enough? That still remained to be tested and I ought to tell you, I myself failed miserably in my first test.\n\nIt had been 6 to 7 months since I had started my practice. My relationship over this period had grown dramatically with my receptionist. He worked part time at my psychiatric clinic. He was actually studying for a Master degree in literature and was trying to make a few extra bucks. Although we dwelled in our own thoughts in our own phases yet, there are times in everyone\u2019s lives when they are downtrodden and need a sympathetic hand. My receptionist\u2019s mom died out of nowhere, and he was beyond tears. I tried to sympathize with him and explain to him using my psychiatric experience that these things happen, and a person needs to move on with his life and remember everything in good faith. As things go by, the sympathizing went on to caressing, and the caressing went on to a make out. Yes, we made out right there in our clinic.\n\nAlthough categorically, it is termed as sympathy sex but for us it turned out to be something else. Love blossomed out of that single evening, and we began to spend more time together-some at his apartment and some at mine while some at the clinic. We began to realize that it is going to be hard living without each other. My parents had died some years ago. I openly proposed marriage. This was the first time he hesitated. And it was the first time that I got worried.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0mqEJ9e.png\n[Image Credit](i.imgur.com/0mqEJ9e.png)\n\nThe reason I got worried was that I had already planned a life with him, the singular reason being that one morning when my pregnancy strip turned out a positive red. It had been a beautiful morning. I had planned to propose him that day- although it is unusual for girls. But that HESITATION, I\u2019ll be damned. It destroyed my day. I asked why he didn\u2019t want to marry me. I still hadn\u2019t told him about our kid. He couldn\u2019t come up with a good enough reason. The next day he resigned. He even changed his apartment. He didn\u2019t even give me a chance. I had no other choice but to get an abortion.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AHdp9ar.jpg\n[Image Credit](i.imgur.com/AHdp9ar.jpg)\n\nEven being a psychiatrist, I started having depression. I couldn\u2019t even handle myself. I went on to live with my sister. One day when I was going down the street to get some bread and eggs, I saw him laughing and having lunch with another girl. It flamed me up. I went there inside and warned the girl not to trust him. She said she was his wife. I was dumbfounded. He had used me. Just for fun for sex. He couldn\u2019t look me in the eye. \n\nPsychiatrists are not omniscient. But I should have known better. I should have made a better selection. Wish I could change my past; I wish I could\u2026.!\n\n**Don't forget to follow @mahekg!!** \n--------------------------------------- \n\n**@crazymumzysa features authors to promote new authors and a diversity of content.

    "body": "Theories on what is in a healthy diet change every season, and navigating those extremes can be confusing. I\u2019ve been watching them change for 20 years. \n\nAs a nutritional therapist and in the spirit of scientific enquiry, I\u2019ve tried several of them, including the Zero Carb, aka the Carnivore diet, or No Plant diet.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/69d58df654.jpg \n\nIn April, 2015, I came across the fascinating story of a couple who had been eating nothing but meat for 18 years, and their two young sons who had eaten only meat for most of their lives. They were all in very robust health. This was quite remarkable, especially considering that at the start, the wife had been very ill and could digest only one food \u2013 beef.\n\nThis led me to a community of other people who had been eating only animal foods for years. Something inside me said \u201cYes, this is what I need to do right now.\u201d So I did. It wasn\u2019t easy at first, as my body had to adjust. But after the first few weeks it worked well for me for quite a while. It felt right, what my body needed. Many people in our online community found they weren\u2019t digesting vegetables, but could easily digest meat. It wasn\u2019t easy socially, people tend to freak out if you don\u2019t eat any vegetables, but my body was liking it. \n\nAfter a year, many of those who started at the same time as me were still going strong, and feeling like it was right for them. But for me, it felt like time to start eating plants again. It took a bit of adjusting again, but now, I\u2019m on a wider range of plant foods than I was before Zero Carb. I\u2019m even eating some grains again, which I hadn\u2019t done for years.\n\nBut there is a wider point to this story, and that\u2019s about how to figure out which of the many hundreds of so-called wonder diets is \u201cthe one\u201d.\n\nWhen I first started studying nutrition, one of the diets I came across was the Atkins diet. Although later he lost the plot, and started using artificial sweeteners and soy, there are aspects still worth mentioning. It was a very misunderstood diet. People thought it was about gorging on bacon, eggs and fatty steak for the rest of your life. \n\nBut what it was really about was eating high fat & protein, lots of salads (which people often forgot to do), and no high carb foods \u2013 temporarily. This was needed as a counterbalance to the high carb, low protein diet people were usually eating to start with. Once the system was corrected, people were to add carbs back in, to come to a more balanced diet.\n\nThis diet was a microcosm of all the dietary chaos out there. It\u2019s a law of nature that when things go to an extreme, they swing back the other way, usually to the opposite extreme, before eventually settling somewhere in the middle. \n\nMany diets are a reaction to either an actual flaw in the current paradigm, or the perception of one. Following the laws of nature, they often go too far the other way, which works fine to start with. But if you don\u2019t come back to middle ground, things eventually go astray.\n\nThe prevailing current paradigm of avoiding saturated fats was a reaction to the misconception that they cause heart disease. Despite the vast body of evidence that this isn\u2019t true, many still believe it. And even if it had been true that we were eating too much saturated fat, going to the opposite extreme of avoiding it would never have been the answer.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/67907baa36.jpg \n\nVegetarianism (or veganism) is similar, though in this case there is usually also a belief that all animal foods are bad for you, combined with ethical dilemmas about animal welfare and caring for the environment.\n\nThe problem with both of these approaches is that they were inevitably high carb.\n\nBecoming more popular over the last decade or two have been Paleo, low carb and ketogenic diets. This includes my Carnivore diet. These have been in reaction to the health problems that have been created by the high carb, low fat paradigm \u2013 obesity, diabetes, even more heart disease, cancer and chronic illnesses. \n\nVeganism and ketogenic / zero carb diets can be viewed as opposite extremes of a pendulum\u2019s swing. Both can work well for a while, as they will generally cut out all junk and artificial foods, giving an immediate improvement in health. But over time, shortfalls begin to show.\n\nAs humans are hunter gatherers, with a digestive tract most like carnivores, the Paleo / keto end of the spectrum tends to be more successful, and for longer. But even that doesn\u2019t work for all, or forever. Even though our bodies can make glucose for energy, for some people that becomes too stressful.\n\nSo what can we learn from this? The bottom line is in the commonalities: Real Food.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/679e66a6e6.jpg \n\nIf you ignore all the rest and JUST EAT REAL FOOD (or JERF as Sean Croxton says), and eat a variety of it you won\u2019t go too far wrong, as a starting point. This means eating what nature made:\n\n\u2022\tPasture raised animal foods \u2013 meat, dairy, eggs\n\u2022\tFish and seafood (ideally not farmed)\n\u2022\tFruit and vegetables (ideally organic)\n\u2022\tNuts and seeds (ideally organic)\n\u2022\tSmall amounts of grains that are organic and properly prepared\n\nIt means nothing that is chemically or artificially made, avoiding junk food, fast food and minimising sugar.\n\nDear God! I\u2019m starting to sound like a dietician who will tell you to eat a balanced diet from all the food groups. Maybe after all my travels through the dietary spectrum, I\u2019ve returned to a mid point not too far away from the existing paradigm?\n\nNo, not really, because I also know that there are more layers, and the sicker you are, the more layers you need to investigate. More about these another time.\n\nBut maybe if we all went back to eating home cooked meals, made from a wide variety of real foods, just like our grandparents did, we\u2019d have taken a first step to healing.\n\nThere seem to be lots of easy real food recipes here on Steemit. I posted one myself here: https://steemit.com/food/@kiwideb/choc-currant-breakfast-smoothie \n\nI have a lot more recipes on my Recipe website http://www.frot.co.nz/design/recipes/ \n\nSome of them are tailored towards people who need to go several layers deeper in their eating changes, but mostly they are fairly simple, easy, tasty recipes that anyone can incorporate. It also includes my real food cooking course \u2013 a 15 lesson, step by step guide to changing over to real food. \n\nFollow me for more posts about different aspects of health and nutrition.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/3d20dc99c0.jpg",

NOW!</p>\n<h1>When I discovered my sexual orientation</h1>\n<center><p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/directory-1187129_12806ce58.png\" width=\"780\" height=\"277\"/></p></center>\n<p>I was six years old the first time I saw<strong> another boy with some interest</strong>. I know it wasn't about friendship, since I felt a bit weird looking at some of them.</p>\n<p>But that was not the point when I realized I'm gay.</p>\n<p>I accepted I'm gay when I was at the start of Medium School (from age 11 to 13). I actually had some signals before, but that's when <strong>I clearly stated \"ok, I'm gay\"</strong>.</p>\n<p>That moment was the hell for me.</p>\n<p>I don't know if this sentence is \"correct\" for journals and law, but in my mind <strong>I've been bullied</strong>. At least with words.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I was the \"girls' friend\" and <strong>they stickied a banana on my t-shirt</strong> witht the sentence \"I love bananas\". I discovered that sticker once I got home and my mom asked me to explain the situation to my teacher.</p>\n<h1>So that's correct! Gays just stay with the girls!</h1>\n<center><p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/chain-1027864_12805a86d.jpg\" width=\"780\" height=\"780\"/></p></center>\n<p>That's one of the common stereotype.</p>\n<p>Nope, <strong>I didn't stay with girls because I don't like being a boy or anything like that</strong>. I stayed with them because I didn't feel comfortable talking about vaginas and so on (the ONLY topic that was allowed).</p>\n<p>I <strong>didn't hate boys</strong>, I just discovered that I finished in a pretty bad class.</p>\n<p><strong>I felt uncomfortable with both sexes </strong>and, when people used to group up, I was left alone because I was a little fat or because I was \"the gay\".</p>\n<p>Also, when <strong>we were having a course about sex and prevention</strong>, when the word \"gay\" came out everyone was looking at me.</p>\n<p><strong>I, officialy, was \"the gay\".</strong></p>\n<h1>Then I started to participate in LGBT groups</h1>\n<center><p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/heart-1348870_12803eea8.png\" width=\"780\" height=\"747\"/></p></center>\n<p>When I turned 14, I started to <strong>join some LGBT associations and groups in my city</strong>. I discovered a friendly environment where <strong>my sexuality was not something to hide</strong>.</p>\n<p>Because that's how it felt when I was in medium school. If I didn't like girls in that way, there's must have been <strong>something strange about me</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I also <strong>tried to have a relationship with one of my friend</strong> (girl friend). We broke up after three days and now we're closer than ever and she's happy to know I'm open with myself and my sexuality.</p>\n<p>Also, she discovered her sexual orientation too. She's bi (bisexual).</p>\n<h1><strong>And then...</strong></h1>\n<center><p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/love-1261895_1280f4760.png\" width=\"780\" height=\"375\"/></p></center>\n<p>Then I finally <strong>came out to a friend who was extremely open and kind with me</strong>. I was denying myself saying <strong>I would have never kissed a boy and stuff like that</strong>, but he just was comfortable speaking about the topic and he helped me a lot in this phase.</p>\n<p><strong>He told me that nothing was wrong about me </strong>and that I should have tried to give my friends a chance. My classmates were pretty fine and kind, so I decided to try out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I came out to one of my closest friend at school</strong>. He was a little surprised about that, but then he just ignored that (in a positive way). Now we are even closer and we talk about everything (yeah, I also talk about handsome guys and so on with him - and he's totally straight).</p>\n<p><strong>I then decided to come out to my entire class.</strong></p>\n<p>They were pretty fine. One of them was annoying, but then he left school.</p>\n<p>But, after that, <strong>I had a bad moment covering the light.</strong></p>\n<center><p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/away-1605990_1280961a0.jpg\" width=\"780\" height=\"519\"/></p></center>\n<p><strong>My family was against one of my best friend at those time</strong> (the first guy I ever came out at) and they decided to flag this \"friendship\" to the police.</p>\n<p><strong>From 14yrs old to 16yrs old I had two psychologist, one psychiatrist and one social worker all together trying to figure out if I was dangerous or not.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I started to cut myself</strong>. I loved feeling the pain and I felt my life was going down every day. I had some \"good moments\", but that's it.</p>\n<p>In fact, when the police made some research, they discovered something pretty stupid, awful and horrible that I've done when I was 11.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anyway, I was 11, so we never met again since I was a kid. <strong>They just made me sign up some papers.</strong></p>\n<p>The same thing didn't happen with social workers and therapists, that <strong>tried to make me understand I did something wrong.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>And <strong>I was perfectly aware of that</strong>. I can't say what I did, but I can say I always clearly stated I did something awful, I know that if &nbsp;I repeat that now I would be in trouble and so on.</p>\n<h1>But, After two years</h1>\n<h1>It was over.&nbsp;</h1>\n<center><p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/frog-152631_1280f0ca3.png\" width=\"780\" height=\"840\"/></p></center>\n<p>I was finally free from all those therapists and <strong>my life improved dramatically</strong>. And some of them was really helpful, don't get me wrong. I also had some good experience. But my psychiatrist was awful and she didn't want to know me better.</p>\n<p><strong>I had some relationships in the meantime, but they were meaningless and those boys just wanted to have sex. </strong>While I was more into having a serious relationship.</p>\n<p>I was on the front line at almost every pride in my Country and I started my own blog about LGBT topics. <strong>I started to be \"the gay\" in the school again</strong>, since everyone knew that, but who cares.</p>\n<p><strong>Once you come out, WHO CARES.</strong> How can somebody insult you calling you \"gay\" if you came out? Just answer \"I know\".</p>\n<p>But <strong>I still used to cut myself</strong>. It was an habit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then,<strong> I decided to trust my friends</strong> when they were saying they cared about me, so I stopped for a bit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I started again later on, but <strong>I'm now proud of saying I didn't cut myself for almost a year now</strong>. That's the longest period of \"no-cutting\" I've ever done but, <strong>best of all, I don't want to cut ever again.</strong></p>\n<p>I'm happy.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm 100% happy of my life</strong>. I have the life I wanted to have, I love an awesome boy who loves me back, I share my awesome life with most of my friends and some of them are really like brothers for me.</p>\n<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>\n<center><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ECU6xtp68</p></center>\n<p>That post was not about \"me and just me\". <strong>I hope this story can help a lot of you struggling about their sexuality or about their coming out.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>When you come out, <strong>you remove a part of your mask</strong>. You become your true you and all of the connections you made in your life (family, friends) become more real.</p>\n<center><p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/04/mr-1527208_1280b225a.jpg\" width=\"780\" height=\"518\"/></p></center>\n<p>Maybe some of them will hate you. So what?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>So you prefer to keep hiding your true identity and your true love just because someone don't like you?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you have to <strong>analyze the situation of your life in that moment</strong>, but when you feel comfortable... don't feel scared.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you live in a friendly and kind friend environment, <strong>you and your friends will just benefit from that</strong>. The same for the family.</p>\n<p>Hope that helped. <strong>I'll talk about my story and my activism later on</strong>. This post was just an introduction to help you understand there are some positive stories out there and you may want to read about them.</p>\n<p>See ya!</p>\n<p>PS: all images are free to use and they're taken from Pexels and Pixabay.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pixabay.com/it/servi-parlando-sorriso-363019/\">First image</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/it/elenco-verit%C3%A0-freccia-direzione-1187129/\">Second image</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/it/catena-forte-protezione-1027864/\">Third image</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/it/cuore-forma-red-amore-1348870/\">Fourth image</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/it/amore-ali-amore-cuore-romanticismo-1261895/\">Fifth image</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/it/via-nebbia-alberi-forest-1605956/\">Sixth image</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/it/rana-anfibio-animale-verde-felice-152631/\">Seventh image</a></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "### <center>What do you need to connect?</center>\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/sk1953agd/Captura_de_pantalla_2016_09_05_a_las_0_54_03.png</center>\n\nEvery day we wake up and we kind of know how our day is going to look like. Everyone plans. Whether you are a student or a worker, when you sit on your bed yawning and recognizing strange line patterns on your carpet you are already thinking what to do next.\n\nStill while your eyes unfocused are looking at the infinity before standing up, your mind is already ahead of you, giving you imaginary pictures about how specific moments from your day are going to look like.\n\nWe are disconnected from what really matters.\n\n---\n\n### <center>Fire</center>\n\nSince the Homo Erectus discovered it 790.000 years ago, we have been travelling trough humankind always holding hands with it without burning ourselves. It gave us the possibility to stop eating raw food and consequently not spend so much time digesting. Fire protected us from predators and gave us heat and light becoming an animal not scared of the darkness.\n\nIt doubled our life expectancy. \n\n<center>https://media.giphy.com/media/rFFQGLNdFynVS/giphy.gif</center>\n\nFire is hypnotic. We can look at the fire and forget about everything. At that moment, it\u00b4s just you looking at the past trough the flames. At that moment, It\u00b4s just you feeling the same way as our ancestors felt when they sat every night around it hiding from the danger inside caverns. \nFire has something magical. It really does.\nWhen you sit in front of it, a feeling of togetherness invades you and warms you from the inside. It\u00b4s not just the heat, I am just talking about something else, something that **connects** us when we look at the fire with someone. A mutual smile outlined by the fire flames and shadows, decorated by the noise of the burning wood.\n\n---\n\n### <center>Water</center>\n\nA very good friend of mine closes his eyes every time he drinks a glass of water. There are not many things that give you such a pleasure as drinking fresh water when the thirst hits. It is as you were drinking life itself. Wet life crossing your throat and reaching every cell of our body making them almost immortal.\n\n<center>https://media.giphy.com/media/AVqxH3OuPiuje/giphy.gif</center>\n\nIt gives our planet a color. A bright blue color in a deep black Universe that sends a signal to the unknown: \nWe are blue, we are water, we are alive.\n\nWhether your child asks you for it or your dog looks at you with thirsty eyes, the moment that you give water to any form of life, an instant bond is made. A **connection** made of drops of kindness.\n\n---\n\n### <center>Air</center>\nThe alveolar membrane is a tiny thin structure inside our lungs, which allows oxygen to enter the bloodstream and carbon dioxide to leave it. This little miracle is the result of thousands of years of evolution and thanks to it, our existence is guaranteed as long as the composition of the atmosphere stays constant.\n\n### <center>https://media.giphy.com/media/zEGYM6XtvW5I4/giphy.gif</center>\nThe sound waves travel through it in the same way as the first travellers colonized new continents pushed by it, almost levitating over clouds of salted foam.\nThe beauty of your loved one is only overcome by the beauty of her breathing noise. A **connection** made of hugs and moving air.\n\n\n---\n\n### <center>Earth</center>\nIt is the earth crust, the foundation of our walking adventure. It is silica, alumina, lime, magnesium, sodium, potassium and iron. It is tectonics plates dancing over the asthenosphere following a chaotic rhythm.\n### <center>https://media.giphy.com/media/yeSTs6GMh50zu/giphy.gif</center>\nIt will be our last witness. The one that will welcome us at the end. The one that won\u00b4t be scared when looking at our pale face. The one that will smile at us when the ultimate **connection** happens: We will be earth.\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/a36ue9ui5/Captura_de_pantalla_2016_08_12_a_las_15_22_42.png",

Needless to say, the list of lavatory restrictions subsequently imposed upon the student body rivaled those of a maximum security prison.\n\nWe were no longer allowed to take a bathroom pass if we needed to use the facilities during class time. Instead, we were escorted as a group, after 2nd and 5th periods, to the \"bathroom trailer\" (the school was in the process of expansion, and while the new buildings were constructed, the upper grades had been relegated to mobile classroom units in what used to be the playground.) Once we arrived at the bathroom, there would be only 5 minutes for everyone who needed to go to do their business before the bell rang for the next period, and there were only two stalls each for boys and girls. \n\nIn addition, each student was required to present their schoolbag and turn out their pockets for search and seizure during homeroom and immediately following lunch. Anyone found to be in possession of a lighter or matches would be presumed guilty of the bathroom arson. No lighters or matches were ever discovered; however, several students were relieved of their pocket knives, bubble gum, Victoria's Secret catalogs, and other contraband. \n\n# So we sat, day in and day out, classrooms full of children fidgeting against the fullness of our bladders, wincing at the aches in our bowels, and fearful of getting caught with some innocuous but illicit item in our backpacks. # \n\nA trend of falling grades accompanied the new bathroom policies, since most of us were so distracted by our bodily discomfort. The teachers also disliked the new rules, because they had to spend so much time enforcing them--time that could have been spent on more productive tasks, like facilitating the education of their pupils.\n\nIt was borderline child abuse, and it didn't even work. The arsonist was never apprehended, though he or she (or perhaps a copycat arsonist, motivated by rage at the school administration's tough stance on bathroom privileges) repeated the act two more times at the peak of the lockdown. The arsonist was cleverer than the administrators, and no amount of rules or restrictions could stop him or her from setting fire to the bathroom. This was an early lesson for me in complex social dynamics, and one of the experiences that formed the foundation of my future anarchistic worldview. Rules don't work, I observed. They only make people grumpy, fearful, and constipated.\n\n# Here's Where Marilyn Manson Comes In. #\n\n<center>![marilyn-manson8dcf1.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/marilyn-manson8dcf1.jpg)</center>\n\nThe year was 1995. Marilyn Manson's cover of the Eurythmics' song \"Sweet Dreams\" was at the top of the pop charts, and the song had lodged itself in my head for weeks. One day, I was quietly humming it in English class while trying to divert my attention from my overfull bladder, when a new version of the song emerged in my mind.\n\n*Wet pants are made of this\nWho am I to ask to pee*\n\nThere were more lyrics, but the intervening years have erased them from my memory. I think one of the verses had to do with poop, and one was a hilarious refrain about toilet fires. The whole thing was sung in the mock-repentant tone of one who has been caught conspiring to set fire to toilet paper.\n\nThis song was the first real bit of satire I ever created, and it was deliciously satisfying.  As satire goes, it wasn't that great, but it was perfect for middle school. \n\n# Potty humor + popular music + anti-authoritarian sentiment = schoolyard hit. # \n\nSoon everyone was singing my song. It was especially gratifying when a chorus broke out in the line for the bathroom one day after second period. \n\nSoon after, some kid added a verse that didn't quite fit. It had a chastising tone. It reversed the roles of the joke. It blamed the arson for the plight of our bladders, instead of placing the blame on the administrators where it belonged. It justified the actions of the administrators, and mockingly accused the students of treachery. I'm not sure, in retrospect, how the kid fit all of those insinuations into a bar of a Marilyn Manson song, but I distinctly remember having the impression that he'd done just that. I've often wondered since if that kid grew up to be a cop.\n\nIn my life, I have created a number of satirical works, from poetry to fiction to click-baity, list-style articles. I even wrote a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Doublespeak-Dictionary-Euphemisms-Dysphemisms-Contrivances/dp/0984203745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472702936&sr=8-1&keywords=the+doublespeak+dictionary\">satirical dictionary</a>. But this experience stands out as formative in my mind because of the lessons I took away, both about satire and about the the nature of rules.\n\n# The secret to good satire is this: it must emerge from truth, and it must poke fun at the authority, the tyrant, the bully, the injustice of the situation. # \n\nIt doesn't work the other way around, at least not for the majority of people. Even if the satire lampoons a more-or-less neutral subject--a popular actor, for instance, or an everyday experience that is commonly had by many people--if you look closely, there will be, at the core of the thing, a sense of wrongness or injustice. If it doesn't have that element, it is not satire. It's most likely propaganda disguised as satire--like every single article The Onion has published about Hillary Clinton since her top donor, Univision, purchased the satirical news outlet. But anyone with  half a thimbleful of wits can see through that weak sauce. Except sociopaths, maybe. \n\nPolitical satire is an art form that I hold very dear, and it is the **only** thing I think I might miss if the state were to wither away tomorrow. In fact, the assured continuation of satire is the only convincing argument I can think of for the continuation of the state. So perhaps, as an anarchist and a political satirist, I am at cross-purposes with myself.\n\nAh, well. Bring on statelessness. Somehow, I'll find a way to manage.\n\n# Thank you for reading! #\n\nHi!

Yes, just six digits.\n\n---\n\nI had a conversation today with my dad after lunch. \n\n### <center>In Spain</center>\n\nWe like, after lunch, relax and talk to each other for at least half and hour. This is a very typical behavior in my country and that usually happens in every family. It is called \u201csobremesa\u201d translated as \"overtable\" and if you go to any restaurant I can guarantee that this scene will be seeing very often.\n\nIn 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire... the A-Team.\"\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/ardsy88x9/Captura_de_pantalla_2016_08_26_a_las_23_04_46.png</center>\nSorry I just loved that tv show when I was little.\n---\n\nAnyway, as I was saying, I had a conversation with my dad. We talked about many things but since I\u00b4m really into Steemit nowadays we ended up talking about it.\n\n>-*You know, when I was eight years old there was some houses in our village that didn\u00b4t have electricity and we had to go to the \u201cbathroom\u201d outside. It was just a very deep hole on the land*.\n-*I know, you\u00b4ve already told me this thousand times*.\n-*I know, I know. My point is that the way the world has changed in the last sixty years is just unbelievable. Now, you are telling me that there is a new virtual coin called steem. It\u00b4s a coin that can be changed into real money but originally it was generated online trough a technology called blockchain. Is this not gone too far?*\n\n### <center>Certainly</center>\n\n <center>Technology is reaching levels of science fiction</center>\n\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/pyydwbq5p/Captura_de_pantalla_2016_08_27_a_las_0_29_49.png</center>\n\n--- \n\nWe live now in a world where we are bombarded by information. We have all we need in the palm of our hand. If we want to read some news, talk to some friend, check the forecast or send a present to your girlfriend who is one month working in Singapore, all we need to do is press some bottoms in our cell phone. \n\nAre we losing the contact with the real world? Japan, which I would say is the most modern society in the world has a big problem at the moment.\n\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/kifq1xwrx/Captura_de_pantalla_2016_08_27_a_las_1_24_19.png</center>\n\n> I remember I met a Japanese guy when I was learning some German in Bremen in 2000. As a cell phone I had one of those bricks with just a screen where you could visualize msgs and make some calls. This guy had already a cell phone with a camera integrated. I just couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.\n\nWhat I mean is that what is happening right now in Japan it will probably hit us in couple of years. Or it is already happening? In the last five years the population in Japan has decreased in one million people. \n\n### <center>0.7% less people than in 2010</center>\n\nThis is what is a bit scary:\n\nLatvia (-1,1%), Lithuania (-1%), Greece (-0,6%), Portugal (-0,6%), Bulgaria (-0,5%), Serbia (-0,5%), Spain (-0,5%), Croatia (-0,4%) y Romania (-0,5%).\n\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/vw29d57al/Captura_de_pantalla_2016_08_27_a_las_1_54_00.png</center>\n\n>  Birth rates in all 28 EU countries are now below replacement rates and all indigenous populations are in decline.Europe is losing faith in itself, and birth rates have collapsed.\n\nsource:http://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/why-is-europe-losing-the-will-to-breed-1.2644169\n### But wait a moment, if we look at it globally we are more people every year on earth. What is going on?\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/5hw9n0oj1/Captura_de_pantalla_2016_08_27_a_las_15_00_31.png</center>\n\nPopulation growth is going to continue in less developed countries. Asia will have most of the people in the world, and Africa will increase the population. The population of these two continents will double by 2050 and 90 percent of world population are going to live in countries seeing as less developed\n\nIn developed countries, women have changed their social role slowly in the last decades. They are more focused on their career than before and their priorities are not just to get married and have a family. Personally, I love this since I believe women are much more intelligent than men and they make better decisions. Men are, in many occasions, blinded by testosterone and although there have been improvements in the gender equality; there is still a long way ahead of us.\n\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/t0ycxri25/Captura_de_pantalla_2016_08_27_a_las_12_58_23.png</center>\n\n---\n\n### <center>Let\u00b4s come back to Japan</center>\n\nJapan is by far the most technological country in the world. Tokyo looks like it is a city extract from any futurist science fiction movie. You walk trough the street and you can breath technology.\n\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/rv409tpgt/Captura_de_pantalla_2016_08_27_a_las_15_40_37.png</center>\n\nWhat we also can see is that Japanese people don\u00b4t express their feelings. We all have seen the videos where the tsunami hit their cities and **the walls of their culture contained the tears of an entire nation.**\n\nTechnology is affecting the way we interact with people. I won\u00b4t list here the thousands of websites which are destined to find partners but I\u00b4ve read that in some cities in Japan, teenagers are flirting trough smart phones although they are in the same room.\n\n### <center>That\u00b4s too weird</center>\n\n<center>https://s20.postimg.org/45ekl4r3h/Captura_de_pantalla_2016_08_27_a_las_21_55_40.png</center>\n\nThings get even more preoccupying if we take a look at adults. 61% of men in Japan between 18 and 34 years of age are single and 1/3 of the men below thirty never had a date.\n\nAre the progress and technology playing against us?\n\nWell, globally, earth is getting more populated so we could say Technology is helping human race.\n\n### <center>But</center>\n\nSome of the most developed countries in the world like Japan or Germany are reducing their populations.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\n---\n\n>-*Hi*.\n-*Ey, Hi*.\n-*I\u00b4m Ethan, we are in the same class in Biology*.\n-*Yes, I know, I\u00b4m Felicity*.\n-*Do you think I can call you some time?*\n-*Sure, what\u00b4s your number?*\n-*340059 and yours*.\n-*I will call you. My dad doesn\u00b4t like boys calling home*.\n\n### Face to face interaction should not be replaced.\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/3ju72rlf1/Captura_de_pantalla_2016_08_25_a_las_17_02_06.png",

    "body": "For about a decade, I was a self-help junkie.\n\n\nI got into it all with the best of intentions: to \"achieve my potential/empowerment,\" and all that jazz.\n\n\nMotivation wasn't in short supply. But I didn't feel capable enough to achieve my ambitions. I didn't \"know enough.\" I had too many \"limiting beliefs.\" Etc, etc, etc.\n\n\nI took to personal development like a crack addict takes to the rock. Full-in. Obsessively. Single-focused. \n\n\nThere was an allure - a tempting promise, underlying the marketing of \"gurus,\" that had me convinced everything I could want was within my reach if I just followed their \"masterful\" advice.\n\n\nI'm not sure if it started with a true sense of needing \"help\" or to be \"fixed\" in any way. I did have my conflicts that weren't serving my advancement, and perhaps was seeking answers and solutions to iron out those kinks. But I was also *over*-confident - perhaps to the point of arrogant, narcissistic, self-righteous, and even slightly delusional, out of touch with reality as I subscribed to over-estimated beliefs in my intelligence, talent, and inherent potential. Though in a field of motivational rah-rah, such \"confidence\" seemed to be praised and encouraged more than checked as a limitation, these self-images themselves false beliefs.\n\n\nEither way...\n\n\nThe deeper I got in, the more the confidence subtly eroded. Or perhaps, it was never confidence to start with - and it was actually the *illusion* of confidence, layers of self-defence mechanisms coded to cover up insecurities, that crumbled as my dependence upon outer guidance grew. That's not to say there wasn't natural confidence built on a foundation of valid reasons. Though, that natural confidence got largely underutilized as my seeking had me looking upwards to others more \"successful\" than I was for guidance, rather than building upon inherent strengths. \n\n\nSomewhere along the way, I fell into a negative vortex.\n\n\nThe ceaseless pursuit of the next teaching, book, cultural meme, or whatever hit of self-help fuelled that high of grandiose aspirations warped my entire mind and ate away at my soul, as I sacrificed my present for the promise of a brighter future - as envisioned through the paradigms of an industry preying on the effects of personal discontent and ambition.\n\n\n<center>\nhttps://s11.postimg.org/y9uzrn8bn/image.jpg\n\n</center>\n\n\nFor years, I subscribed to theories commonly-held as truths: well-intended dogma such as \"goal-setting,\" \"empowering beliefs,\" and the usual cliche presumptions found throughout personal development - all moreless implying we can do anything we put our minds to, with enough persistence.\n\n\nSo I set goals. And fell & failed.\n\n\nI rewrote beliefs, from limiting to \"supportive.\" And still, life really didn't give a fuck *what* I believed. It continued to serve straight-up doses of reality, without patience or compassion for my naive ignorance.\n\n\nLooking back at it all, the years were sort of encompassed within a cloudy haze of misinformation.\n\n\nThe more I sought \"Truth\" and \"clarity,\" the further I fell victim to my own bullshit - beliefs I was destined for something more than a shared humanity with all its flaws, that I was bigger & better than the egoic parts of myself that made my best their bitch through my denial of their existence, that I could somehow bypass the years of character development & maturation required to handle the successes I desired.\n\n\nT'was not as smooth a journey as the self-help gurus sold. But then again, they wouldn't have sold much had they dished out the Truth that success requires a shitload more work than the majority of lazy masses are willing to put in. \n\n\nSo yeah...\n\n\nIn attempts to rid my head of a life of cultural/societal conditioning and set myself straight, I handed responsibility for my direction over to new cultures who talked slick and told stories appealing to my desires for nearly-instant-gratification. Of course, they professed hustle was required. Did they ever. But in the end, they also professed a lot as Truth that turned out to be just plain *wrong* within the contexts of life I, myself, had to deal with.\n\n\nIt's not as though many *intentionally* were misleading their followers.\n\n\nMoreso, it was just they were preaching one-size-fits-all solutions and advice - that didn't account for the reality that every individual's needs are different at different points in their journeys.\n\n\nThat's not to say there wasn't wisdom in many of their teachings. Rather - it may be far from wise to promote guidance as wisdom applicable in all situations, when it might actually be completely misleading for some individuals in some situations.\n\n\nThe motivational hype was easy to sell.\n\n\nThe discernment essential to customize information delivery specific to the precise needs of an individual and the practicality of communicating intricate distinctions vital to ensuring wise guidance fits a student's timing cycle - these are much more difficult to execute within a business model geared towards mass appeal.\n\n\n<center>\nhttps://s16.postimg.org/td7xlpwk5/image.jpg\n\n</center>\n\n\n\n\nSo, it is what it is...\n\n\nAnd if sense some tinge of resentment within my writing at a decade of having misdirected my energies due to conviction in the whole \"personal development\" thing and were to call it out, you'd probably be right.\n\n\nMaybe it was there all along - though there's a part of me that feels somewhat shaken up and *lost.*\n\n\nIt seems like I had my goals - and in pursuit of all this extraneous information that was supposed to help the achievement of those goals, I got sidetracked, distracted, and spun out living based on someone else's storylines. Of course, there's no one or nothing to blame - and one might even go as far to say, with all that hippie-dippie shit, it was \"meant to be.\" \n\n\nThere are lessons and wisdom in \"failures\" that can *never* be taught in any book. There's necessary guidance that may only be found off-track.\n\n\nAnd sometimes, life might need to throw us some curveballs to knock us straight in the fucking forehead and knock the sense out of us, in order to disorient and humble us to the degree we become humble enough to accept the track we were on was never the \"right\" track we thought in the first place. Or perhaps it was for the time - though upon entering new chapters, there's just transitions in store we never could have anticipated, from our past levels of awareness...\n\n\n\n\n<center>\nhttps://s16.postimg.org/4ro4ed61h/image.jpg\n\n</center>\n\n\n\n\nWhat *was* my addiction to, *really*?\n\n\nWhile on the surface, it might be tempting to say \"self-help\" itself - or the seeking, the chase, the highs of \"ah ha's\" gleaned in seminars and motivational programs - might it have been just as equally true that what drove all that self-indulgent behavior was little more than **a desire for control**?\n\n\nPerhaps I was too cocky - and too afraid - to admit I *wasn't* in full control of my life.\n\n\nThis whole concept of, \"you can have it all...\" That we can design our lives according to our own immediate desires and don't have to bother with the inconveniences of what soul contracts we may be under obligation to fulfil... Is such not but all birthed out of the contrastive experience *many* of us petty human beings find ourselves in in this realm - somehow or another restricted and oppressed by limitations, be they physical, emotional, intellectual, cultural, governmental, or otherwise?\n\n\nThe billion-dollar self-improvement movement has sold out countless conference rooms and even stadiums full of people, riled up to believe they have the \"potential\" to overcome \"all\" obstacles and achieve the lives of their dreams. Though have any of those \"leaders\" been real enough with the audiences to call it out like it is - raising questions of why it is in the first place that such desires arise to rise above all the \"petty\" challenges that are simply a natural part of the human experience - or of why the prime outcome promised in each program sold is the *sense* of exemption from the uncomfortable experience of **not** being in control of our lives...?\n\n\nNot likely.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nThe **illusion** of control sells.\n\n\nIt's why people pay gurus for answers. It's why others pop pills to produce a predictable experience day-in-day-out by suppressing emotions that challenge their \"stability.\" It's why millions of others settle into safe routines of coming home after a 9-to-5 to numb their minds with video games where they're in the pilot seat or TV, where the power exercised over a remote control grants access to the selection of a stream of information satisfactory to established belief systems reinforcing some faint **illusion** of control in a non-sensical world where the idea of our infinitesimally-smallness, frailty, weakness, and morality shake the ego to its core.\n\n\n\n\n<center>\nhttps://s14.postimg.org/r7x5mb5q9/image.jpg\n\n</center>\n\n\n\n\nSome *have* managed to act upon the personal development gurus' guidance with great success, no doubt. Some have an innate set of talents & strengths to act upon certain advice, set their sights upon a target, and hustle until the bullseye is hit.\n\n\nTo suggest that *anyone* can do the same, however - is a sheer, irresponsible propagation of bullshit.\n\n\n**Not** all men are created equal.\nThrow the idealism out the window.\n\n\nI can write half-decently and might excel at music. But I sure as fuck would not make a good open heart surgeon.\n\n\nStephen Hawkings might be one badass astrophysicist. But he ain't never gonna win no sumo wrestling championship - no matter *how* much he \"sets his mind to it.\"\n\n\nWe **can't** merely choose goals at random and achieve them. Period.\n\n\nIf we have a strong backing of natural inclination at something and some serious persistence, *maybe.* But there must be a question of, where does a goal really come from - the mind, or heart? The ego, or the soul?\n\n\n(And not to side with the new-age extremists, either, by implying there's anything \"bad\" about the ego either... fuck that spiritual-righteousness bullshit. None of us are gonna escape ego as long as alive, so may as well embrace, tame, and channel it wisely & constructively.)\n\n\n\n\n<center>\nhttps://s12.postimg.org/hdhvt12nh/image.jpg\n\n</center>\n\n\n\n\nSave the poetic, new-age, sugar-coated takes on it - we're in 5D now.\n\n\n(Maybe beyond. And for those still in 3D, it probably hasn't been too easy a ride, lately.)\n\n\nShit don't work like it used to.\n\n\nLife isn't always direct.\n\n\nWe're evolving from dual-helix, carbon-based DNA creatures to 12-helix crystalline DNA. Who the fuck knows exactly what that even means or the implications. But ignorance aside, we can be sure it means **transformation**. In ways we likely cannot yet possess the foresight to see or understand.\n\n\nGoodbye, illusion of control.\n\n\nAnd maybe, that parting with false beliefs and outdated paradigms is a good thing. \n\n\nThere's some significant global challenges on the collective plate, with environmental crises, economic crises, wars, and all that jazz. Maybe a complete breakdown of our old ways is in order to crack us open to possibilities of experiencing and engaging in life in ways that can never conform to any cultural paradigm that's come before. That kinda fits the whole theory of evolution, after all.\n\n\nSo, from the analysis of this past addictive pattern of seeking answers and motivational juice to achieve great ambitions, to moving through the humility of accepting limitations of ignorance, to expanding into the broader vision of how we are evolving as part of a greater whole...\n\n\nWhat *is* a \"worthy\" goal - a new track, an alternative direction to that travelled before in misinformation - outcomes of which would inevitably satisfy the sacrificed investments of time & energy required to materialize...?\n\n\nAs old ways of being fail to work anymore, how are we to redefine, recreate, and reestablish ourselves within a continually-transforming playing field - continually adapting to the requirements of the game, in which there are no \"gurus\" or \"experts\" who have the answers, given things are shifting so fast before our eyes, strict reliance upon yesterday's knowledge shall stall us to the speed and fate of dinosaurs...?\n\n\n<center>\nhttps://s12.postimg.org/66b1cd5f1/image.jpg\n\n</center>\n\n\n\n\nSometimes I question the value of such large questions...\n\n\n\"*Who am I, to exercise any sort of leadership of the sort, when I haven't even been able to create the results I want in my life? What authority do I have, when I haven't even been able to put the advice I've been given into action to create the success I desire in my life, to then go tell anyone else how they ought to be living theirs...?*\"\n\n\nMaybe that was another cultural code (bug) I picked up from the self-help game - this idea that part of being successful is sharing tips with others so they become successful. Seems like quite the rampant bug, considering how many business & life coaches there are these days. Yet isn't there a strong element of arrogance there - in the idea that any of us have what it takes to declare ourselves in a better position than another to tell *them* how to live their lives...?\n\n\nYou wanna know what it'll take for **you** to be successful?\n\n\nI don't fucking know.\n\n\nAnd anyone else who will \"confidently\" tell you they do is probably talking out of their asses.\n\n\nNo one knows the full scope of your experience, knowledge, wisdom, talents, inclinations, challenges, strengths, weaknesses, failures, successes, hangups, hidden gifts & opportunities, and details of your soul contracts. Hell, the majority of this stuff probably still lies within **our own** blind spots.\n\n\nSome might have enough macho naivety to ambitiously stake their claim on a set outcome and push forcefully, chasing it like a primitive predator. But let's be real for a moment: life rarely conforms to the ideals of our ambitions. \"Plan to fail 9 times out of 10,\" my mentor Roger Hamilton teaches - now *that* is the beginning of honest guidance.\n\n\nWhat worked consistently in the past for others in all likelihood will not work consistently for us now and in the future. We are different people. It is different times.\n\n\nThe journey of life typically contains a lot more chaotic twists and turns than expected. Progress isn't linear. Often, it isn't direct.\n\n\nSometimes, we gotta change tracks a thousand times - each we step off of, the result of a choice made at a lower level of awareness than we've risen to during the last leg. Like a ship at sea or a rocket heading to a destination in space, the bulk of our time might be spent in course correction - each period a learning cycle providing feedback there *is* no other way to receive than by going against the grain of logic and preconception.\n\n\nThis is about the point I shut myself the fuck up now, as I may be venturing too far into sounding as though I know what I'm talking about - when really, I might just be fucking clueless...\n\n\n<center>\nhttps://s21.postimg.org/hzlxz1q93/image.jpg\n\n</center>\n\n\nI had my goals for the music biz.\n\n\nTotally didn't work out as planned.\n\n\nMaybe I wasn't focused enough. Maybe it wasn't meant to be. Maybe the \"not meant to be\" was simply an excuse. \n\n\nLife threw its curveballs. And in hindsight, it's all good. I'm probably happier now with what's resulted of veering \"off track\" than if my ambitions had materialized at such an early age. Not to say I'm truly happy. But maybe I wouldn't be happy with what I *thought* I wanted when I was younger - and maybe it's a blessing I didn't get it, because I probably would've blown myself out going that big that fast. Or maybe that's all just an attempt at rationalizing my lack of focus and persistence that would've actualized the goals. Maybe I would've been there by now, had I not spent years writing circular neurotic streams of thought.\n\n\nAlong the journey, I've gone down paths and gotten into things I wouldn't have guessed. Maybe I'm just fucking ADD, though a lot of those have captured my attention in ways that I've discovered new depths and breadths of passion. I've been hella scattered among music, business, metaphysics, brainwave science, philosophy, health, and beyond - and truthfully, I've found more joy in those explorations than I had in the dabbles into music. So if \"following your passion\" is sound advise, then maybe I *havent* been \"off-course - and those initial music-focused goals needed an upgrade, because they were simply a starting point.\n\n\nOr maybe I needed some major diversions along the way, collecting a whole shitload of life experience, insight, and discoveries within the depths of the soul to channel back into my musical art when it comes time to pick up. Maybe I needed to learn volumes about all different aspects of business and venture even further off into the realms of disruptive technology and the blockchain, for something awaiting ahead - perhaps not just making my own music, but serving in an industry & cultural transformation through the innovation of business models & collaborative systems built on this next wave of technology sweeping the globe.\n\n\nWho knows.\n\n\nIt *sounds* like an appealing prospect. Though perhaps I've wisened up enough to accept the outcomes aren't *entirely* in my control, as they never were.\n\n\nPerhaps enough wisdom has been extracted from the years of setbacks and \"failures,\" to be real enough to embrace the limits of my ignorance - and no longer even be tempted to think any amount of motivational bullshit could override life's processes already set in motion.\n\n\nOr perhaps I'm still in a chapter, playing the fool - rationalizing the misdirection of creative energies into excuses, blaming circumstances on theories that control is an illusion and the self-help industry's got it all wrong, when I could be digging in to do the dirty work, putting in the sweat in the studio (currently a MacBook & headphones) to plant those feet one in front of the other, compiling my audio portfolio, beat-by-beat.\n\n\nTwo extremes as options.\n\n\nThe Truth, most likely resides somewhere in the middle.\n\n\nEither way, one thing is for sure: the path is indirect.\n\n\nAnd while I may always have addictive tendencies, I can be thankful to have exited the self-help cult with enough dignity in hand and discernment to see through the fluff of the motivational bullshit - hopefully having taken enough wisdom away from all the experience to both pay it forward, and let my actions do the talking from this point forward.\n\n\n<center>\nhttps://s11.postimg.org/hvz0rcjdv/image.png\n\n</center>\n\n\nTake what you will from all the above. Because in some way or another, parts of this are reflections of your story, too. And then - if you're up for the challenge - pay the wisdom forward... ;-)",

It sure is crazy\n\nWhen you are a kid, It seems like everyday lasts a lifetime. If you stay up late, wake up early. You can accomplished everything and everything in that one day.\nIt's pretty disappointing when you are an adult and you realize that your time is so finite. And it's easy to spend one day working on a simple projects that yields little to no positive  results. Being self employed is more stressful than I could ever imagine. \n\nI have the greatest Ideas, Things to create and write. yet It seems like now that I have left my job, I actually accomplish less. \n\n## Could it be the endless suffering I had at my job, Forcing me? motivating me? ##\n\n## Or is it just my spurts of ideas that are taking over to the point no human can accomplish those things in one lifetime? ##\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/7LZGILN\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7LZGILN.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nI decided to sit down with my Wacom Cintiq, and draw. Just draw. \nWhile this isn't \"dedicated practice\" because I'm not focus on building skill or techniques. \nIt's more of  a playful practice to spark my creativity to bring in more fun ideas.\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/7Sz1127\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7Sz1127.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nI decided to draw little animals and creatures. That would make a fun coloring page. Or even a sweary page. \nAlthough I really don't need to start another coloring book, I only have 5 million ideas already going. And there is only so much I can smash together into one book, Until people start to complain. \n\nTomorrow I book my trip to San Diego, and I feel like dying of excitement, After having a childhood of no traveling or vacations, I get extra excited to see a new area outside of Utah. \n\nI also paid for a custom made Steemit sign to take on my trip :) maybe I can take some super cool pictures to help advertise Steemit as a whole, I mean Steemit did fund a massive chunk of the trip! \n\nI've also been working on recoloring my hair. I have red hair, and I want to go even more red. \nMore of a carrot orange color! \n\nI was going to dye my hair blue for Steemit Like \n@treeshaface\nBut I decided that the upkeep for blue hair would be too much for me to handle.\n\nSo I guess I'll be the KaylinArt Carrot head!",

    "body": "<center>![pexels-photo0d790.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/24/pexels-photo0d790.jpg) </center>\n\n<center> [Photo Source ](www.lifeofpix.com) </center>\n\nHey Steemit friends!\n\nJust came across a fascinating article, [\u201cWhy So Many Smart People Aren\u2019t Happy..\u201d](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/why-so-many-smart-people-arent-happy/479832/?utm_content=buffer4b492&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer) It\u2019s an interview with insights from the new book, *If You\u2019re So Smart, Why Aren\u2019t You Happy?* \n\nHaving been blogging about personal development for nearly a decade now, I\u2019ve spent an outrageous amount of time thinking about happiness and chasing fulfillment -- with many ups and downs along the way.\n\nUnderstanding human behavior is truly what gets me out of bed each day. \n\nThe article is a must read, especially the bit on winning the lottery, but I wanted to elaborate on some of the more thought provoking points I came across \u2014 **This is ESPECIALLY relevant Steemit newcomers who have yet to find \u201csuccess\u201d on Steemit and are losing hope.** \n\nHere are a few of my takeaways... \n\n> \"Ultimately, what we need in order to be happy is at some level pretty\n> simple. It requires doing something that you find meaningful, that you\n> can kind of get lost in on a daily basis.\"\n\nFulfillment is simple. But difficult. \n\nI've noticed something fascinating during my first few weeks of using Steemit. Money aside, this platform has made me fall **in love** with writing again! And for that I'm forever grateful. \n\nWould I be stoked if every one of my articles hit the front page? Of course.\n\nBut slowly, I've discovered that my motivations here aren't purely monetary. Instead, I'm just so bloody excited to share my thoughts, ideas, and story with the world!\n\nI'm so honored and humbled, to share and give back to this incredible community on a daily basis. Nothing can stop me!\n\nI love getting comments and emails from users who have been impacted by my work. I love connecting with other like minded people and talking about the ups and downs of life. \n\nI love sitting down to an empty page and thinking, \"How can I add value to the world today?\"\n\nFor the last few years I've struggled immensly with writers blog. But since becoming an active member of the a community the writers block has all but vanished.\n\nOn the most basic level, **Steemit has changed my life.** \n\n> \"The reason why it's important to not tie happiness to outcomes is\n> that outcomes by themselves don't really have an unambiguously\n> positive or negative effect on your happiness.\"\n\nWe're unfortunately addicted and driven by an outcome driven world.\n\nIf we can just buy a new car.. everything will be set.\n\nIf we just get that raise.. we can finally relax.\n\nIf we just travel to the other side of the world.. our problems will disappear.\n\nYet.. \n\nTime and time again, science has proven fulfillment cannot and will never be the result of a specific outcome. Rather, true lasting fulfillment comes from the process itself.\n\nIt's why I get so frustrated and sad seeing enthusiastic newcomers come here, post a few times, **then give up.**\n\nWe live and die by outcomes. \n\nInstead of investing in the fulfilling process of creation, they let the ideal of being on the homepage distract them. \n\nOf course, that isn't to say you shouldn't want to pursue certain goals. Rather, it's a reminder to embrace the process more so than the end result itself. Enjoy the journey and the rest will fall into place. \n\n> \"There are expectations that if you achieve some given thing, you're\n> going to be happy. But it turns out that's not true. And a large part\n> of that is due to adaptation, but a large part of it also is that you\n> see this mountain in front of you and you want to climb over it. And\n> when you do, it turns out there are more mountains to climb.\"\n\nThis line really hit me like a sack of bricks. Time and time again, I've reached my desired outcome.. only to find myself asking, \"what's next?\"\n\nWhere's the fun in that?\n\nInstead of wishing for less mountains, we must look for ways to enjoy the climb. Maybe that's enjoying the view on the way up. Or being grateful for the shoes that keep the pebbles out.\n\nAgain, that isn't to say there won't be tough times. Sometimes life just sucks. Life is unfair. \n\nBut if we train our mind and eyes to enjoy the path we walk we will be that much closer to lasting fulfillment. \n\n> There's no way to scientifically prove that one of these beliefs is\n> more accurate than another. But if you believe life is benign, you're\n> going to see lots of evidence for it. If you think life is malign,\n> you're going to see lots of evidence for it. It's kind of like a\n> placebo effect.\n\nI really liked this last quote. For much of my life, I was always jumping at any chance I could to throw a pity party. \n\nIt made me feel good to make excuses. It made me feel good to find all what was wrong in the world.\n\n**Or so I thought.** \n\nIt wasn't until I starting choosing to see each obstacle and setback as an opportunity that my life began to transform. Truly. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying that everything that happens to you has meaning. Life is unfair, and at times plain brutal.\n\nI'm not suggesting you turn your back to reality. What I am suggesting is that you give yourself every advantage to find a life with meaning -- and that starts with viewing the world in an empowering lens. \n\nInstead of throwing your hands up in the air at every setback, strap up and push through. \n\nInstead of being [cynical](https://steemit.com/life/@aboundlessworld/how-to-stop-being-so-damn-cynical)  invest your time and energy into unlocking the endless potential of the world. \n\nIf you're so smart, choose to be happy. \n\nWould love to hear what you think! I\u2019ll be checking in on the comments and upvoting the ones the community finds most helpful.\n\nExcited about this discussion. :)\n\n----\n\nIf you enjoy writing on self improvement, Steemit tips and tricks, and travel be sure to [follow me here](https://steemit.com/@aboundlessworld)\n\nIf you enjoyed this post you might also like\n\n[How To Stop Being So Damn Cynical](https://steemit.com/life/@aboundlessworld/how-to-stop-being-so-damn-cynical)\n\n[9 Life Lessons I Learned As A Waiter](https://steemit.com/life/@aboundlessworld/9-life-changing-lessons-i-learned-as-waiter)\n\n[Addiction, Depression, And How To Change The World](https://steemit.com/life/@aboundlessworld/addiction-depression-and-how-to-change-the-world-greater-than)\n\n[How To Build A Genuine Following On Steemit](https://steemit.com/steemit/@aboundlessworld/how-to-build-a-genuine-following-on-steemit)\n\n[The Psychology Behind Social Proof And Why It Matters](https://steemit.com/psychology/@aboundlessworld/the-psychology-behind-social-proof-and-why-it-matters) \n\n[How To Develop A Mindset of Growth](https://steemit.com/life/@aboundlessworld/how-to-develop-a-mindset-of-growth)\n\n[I Did 10K Pushups In ONe Month And This Is What Happened](https://steemit.com/life/@aboundlessworld/i-did-10k-pushups-in-one-month-and-this-is-what-happened)",

I appear to be stuck in some sort of endless loop, so I have written some pseudocode to help me work things out.

Please keep in mind I have willingly chosen to become a parent, thus logic must not be my strong suit.\n\n<h3>Pseudocode</h3>\n\n```\n// Welcome to parenthood!\n// Initialize kid count and begin parenting\nvar kidCount = 1;\nparentingDayByDay();\n\nfunction parentingDayByDay() {\n\n  if (kidCount == 1) {\n    thisIsntSoBad();\n  } else if (kidCount == 2) {\n    okNowThisIsPrettyBad();\n  } else if (kidCount == 3) {\n    iAmHere();\n    if (you == smart) {\n      takeCareOfBusinessAsap();\n    }\n  } else {\n\t whatTheHeckIsWrongWithYou();\n  }\n  \n  setLackOfSleepState(kidCount);\n  experienceLoveGreaterThanAnyYouHaveKnownB4(kidCount);\n  spendQualityTimeWithSignificantOther(kidCount);\n  \n  parentingDayByDay();\n\t\n} // end parentingDayByDay\n```\n\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n\n**function thisIsntSoBad() {**\n\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://67.media.tumblr.com/1077b9b4f77469c2e63f2f89d6707259/tumblr_nz033lteLM1tm081co1_r1_500.png\"><img src=\"http://67.media.tumblr.com/1077b9b4f77469c2e63f2f89d6707259/tumblr_nz033lteLM1tm081co1_r1_500.png\" /></a>\n  \n**}**\n\n**function okNowThisIsPrettyBad() {**\n\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/70/70d9775a4cfb1cc8116c47e3d6559cbe40c702543956c5d162c52ede8ee6c945.jpg\" />\n  \n**}**\n\n**function iAmHere() {**\n\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GVS2xdFwe80mHd3LE1kjy4oopz5wrWwreryXDxm5bP2VBKAvWuOj_ie1B8QfRdk-BIQ1YlndpyoCD6AeXPuZ6u-a0HfaCmGRI2ivtggOL2wZn6uqyKkIwlY5LJcBRabU9KSVb8A-j1iOwrU9EYyUnL-3WX4TXKFyOk5jsT_WDGuv0XbgX7UnXTfx7vpaGxGVjgpM4LyZtaOJLS8ZOBuKcl4QRbKRn3xxBBWuZ0U9YsaGTA9RVyU2Szbj_CeOF3UbOajnas3JQwJF6iqyzYIIieu2-3QNd4yaS0bASiHJUXUXSCH7SATUbuPpdMzMxl3EDQj9PKXcON7CvuW8yMMCGTB3aHr4xily7W_j3hZk53O7YvbLI4GAdF5ltzqpMZUq78Uncfn9ZDffV8ffbdwZchdlgA4KJZRgU-XY6JYjLeGbIUiLsAA0QWxeQaLHve9NfTq0G1GIv96g0pbNIzgeBQlImI76rBwD33Um2-FiKhF9GDH4cD2UoGiH1968F5AGQaQWRVjk2PylFbk4wIVP5jMF77IqcdPYsHq6zV2cWNFKbzK_1SbZb3BwyrmD4PUH67J-bwo_wYg-kyYTHNcDr089oKc_nFtP1BGrQ4b9OO4MFY6U-g=w1620-h1080-no\" /> \n   \n**}**\n\n**function takeCareOfBusinessAsap() {**\n\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/de/97/fb/de97fbbc0446654b29d0f820b065889c.jpg\" /> \n   \n**}**\n\n**function whatTheHeckIsWrongWithYou() {**\n\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://m.memegen.com/4ysw36.jpg\" /> \n   \n**}**\n\n**function setLackOfSleepState(kidCount) {**\n\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/19yjsh.jpg\" />\n  \n**}**\n\n**function experienceLoveGreaterThanAnyYouHaveKnownB4(kidCount) {**\n\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/19yjxc.jpg\" />\n  \n**}**\n\n**function spendQualityTimeWithSignificantOther(kidCount) {**\n\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.todaysparent.com/kids/when-your-kid-catches-you-having-sex/\"><img src=\"http://www.todaysparent.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/kid-at-door-article.jpg\" /></a>\n    \n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**if (you != smart) ++kidCount;**\n  \n**}**\n\n<h3>The Issue...</h3>\n\nNo matter how I look at things I seem to be stuck in an endless recursive call.

    "body": "Let's talk about you for a minute. YOU are fucking amazing. I wish we told each other this more often! \n\nExcuse the language. It's not meant to turn you away. Truth be told, swears point me in the other direction. I walk away from people with dirty mouths. I was taught to speak \"properly,\" but it is more than that. \n\n<center> https://i.imgsafe.org/57e985dd93.jpg </center>\n\nI must have started typing this ten times. Words are tricky. I spent a long time in a home with a man who said he loved me while he tore me down. I've learned he is a typical narcissist. He built himself up at my expense. I fell in deep. I got used to the cursing and it being directed at me. Okay, fine. That's true. That's me. I'm a bitch. You are right.\n\nMy friends saw what was happening. Most of them disappeared. I can't blame them for being afraid. It must have been hard to watch my life. I folded up as small as possible and chose to never push back. I didn't believe I could. \n\n<center> https://i.imgsafe.org/57f03d84d7.jpg </center>\n\nI don't know how much it is safe to share. I need to share. I cannot keep talking to myself. I have two friends left, but I have leaned on them so much. \n\nI don't know what my point it here. I had to go back to look. I am happy to be talking to you. You *are* amazing. Fucking amazing. It is hard to say it that way, but I am taking that word back and the others that came at me. \n\nI wish it could be more in this image. I see others sharing their faces. I am hopeful the day will come for me when I am safe and free again. I hope this \"kiss\" reaches you. It feels scary to share it, honestly. Like he could find me by my lipstick even though I just got it. I can't keep living in this mental box. \n\n<center>https://i.imgsafe.org/5cd804671a.jpeg</center>\n\nBe excellent to each other, \n\nDani",

Earth's surface is mostly covered in salt water but we live on dry land, so it is easy for us to forget how important the oceans are for our survival</b>.\n\n----\n\nThe new, comprehensive <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-046_0.pdf\">study</a> that involved 80 scientists from tens of different countries and published by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) shows the powerful effect global warming has on the oceans. \n\nhttp://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg541/Peter_April/ada_zpsnvs3zugm.jpg\n[Photo <a href=\"http://www.wallpaperup.com/171798/Sea_Water_Underwater_world_Nature.html\">source</a>]\n\nThe oceans assimilate over 90% of the heat which is trapped in the atmosphere, because of rising greenhouse gas emissions. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the top layer of the ocean (up to few meters deep) has been continuously warming up with the speed of approximately 0.13 \u00b0C per decade and it is escalating. When we try to imagine the amount of water included in this top layer of all five oceans, then we realize how much energy has been needed to increase the temperature to such extent. The scientists predict that the sea temperature could rise up to 4 \u00b0C by the end of this century, if we keep <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@logic/effects-of-global-warming-captured-in-powerful-photographs-the-story-of-planet-earth\">warming the climate</a> in current pace. This would completely devastate ocean ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg541/Peter_April/jf_zpscvefvudn.jpg\n[Photo <a href=\"http://www.abhishekdeepak.com/blog/underwater-photography-tips-technique\">source</a>]\n\nThe change of temperature hugely impacts the fundamental segment of sea life such as plankton. It causes fish to move into different feeding range which influences their reproduction and numbers. This causes domino effect within the food chain.\nThe study points out that warming of the oceans will further decimate ocean species despite that there are already more than <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/our-work/iucn-red-list-threatened-species\">23,000 sea species</a> regarded as threatened with extinction.\nGrowing assimilation of carbon dioxide rises water acidification. When ocean becomes more acidic, it starts to dissolve calcium carbonate shells of many marine organisms such as corals, clams, shrimps and crabs.\nThe warming of the ocean causes large scale migrations of many animal species. Fish, squids, sea turtles, jellyfish and even birds are forced to move away from equator towards colder areas. These animals often become invasive in new regions expanding the damage to local ecosystems.\n\nhttp://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg541/Peter_April/aaa_zpsvz8yxenp.jpg\n[Photo <a href=\"http://earthjustice.org/slideshow/under-the-sea-with-david-doubilet\">source</a>]\n\nThese changes do not only affect the oceans but also what is on the land. We will see more and more droughts, floods, hurricanes, torrential rains and even <a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@logic/global-warming-can-cause-earthquakes\">earthquakes</a>, which will intensify migration of human populations.\nAll these factors have become positive feedback loops which started to exponentially increase existing negative changes in all global ecosystems.\n\nhttp://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg541/Peter_April/sf_zps1u0tnush.jpg\n[Photo <a href=\"http://earthjustice.org/slideshow/under-the-sea-with-david-doubilet\">source</a>]\n\n----\n\n References: \n\nThe IUCN study, 2016 - <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46254\">\"Explaining ocean warming\"</a>.\n\nThe IUCN article - <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/our-work/iucn-red-list-threatened-species\">\"Red List of Threatened Species\"</a>.\n\nNational Geographic article - <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/oceans-warming-global-environment-climate/\">\"The Oceans Can\u2019t Protect Us Anymore - Here\u2019s Why\"</a>.",

I felt isolated, afraid, vulnerable - a 'ghost in the machine'. In the absence of any meaningful assistance, I learned that I was going to have to 'get tough and fight back.' But in doing so (an event which I avoided for as long as possible, suffering various humiliations and torments along the way) my worst fears were realised: <em>in utilising \u2018the dark side\u2019, I unleashed a mighty destructive force which went on to almost ruin my life. </em>Yes, I 'manned up' and kicked the crap out of that girl - but what good did it do me, really, as the rest of the kids carried on as usual? &nbsp;Did the bullies leave me alone after that? Yes.But now I had an even bigger problem... This experience had awoken the sleeping dragon. <em>The rebel in me arose, and she was ANGRY.<br>\n<br>\n</em>Embracing my inner rebel wholeheartedly took me to some very dark places; places in which I need not have spent time had I had access to the truth about the world I live in earlier.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/540068_478991385478403_625957033_n.jpg?oh=b4bdb898147fcfeeadfc3f8fdd2e0a57&amp;oe=585C6B3A\" width=\"720\" height=\"704\"/></p>\n<p><em>Photo - 'Stewart and the Stolen Chair' by </em><a href=\"http://www.johndmoulton.com/\"><em>John D Moulton</em></a><strong><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNo, I didn\u2019t go on to bully others: I was far too 'sensitive' for that.</strong> But I did become uncontrollably angry and bitterly resentful. Being forced to physically defend myself only ostracised me even further. Rage at the unfairness and injustice in the world around me began to take over my existence. Most of it was directed inwards, in frustration at my inability to break free from the oppression and dehumanising grip of society\u2019s demands and restrictions- in \"not fitting in\", and in not <em>wanting</em> to fit in with people who misunderstood me so completely. The outward manifestations (self-harm, getting drunk, smoking) resulted in my being taken into care, ostracised from my family, alone. Confused and in unspeakable pain, and desperate for respect and validation, I ran away with a \u2018man\u2019 (I struggle to refer to him as that) more than twice my age. A Hell's Angel, no less. I\u2019ll leave the rest to your imagination - whatever you come up with probably won\u2019t be that much worse than actual events...<br>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.jaytaylor.co.uk/steemit/angry-girl600dpi.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><em>Photo - 'Angry Girl' (Jay Taylor)</em><strong><br>\n<br>\nMany years later, I no longer blame those around me for this chain of events. </strong>I\u2019m not writing this to apportion blame, or stir up guilt. I know that the adults in my life at that time did what they did because of their societal programming, and could not have acted otherwise, even if it looked to me like they could have at the time.<br>\n<br>\nAs a result of the 'designer disease' of denial which afflicts the majority of people, they did not question their beliefs or their actions for long enough or hard enough to have any chance of seeing through the faulty paradigm spoon-fed to them by society. They had not figured out what is going on on this planet on a wider scale. They were, in that sense, innocent. <em>They had not made the connection between the bullies we relentlessly produce and unleash upon our innocent, unprepared children, and the bullies who are calling the shots at the 'Top of the World'. </em>None of them knew a damned thing about life itself, and how it works.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>But now I know, and I\u2019m shouting it from the rooftops, metaphorically speaking.&nbsp;<br>\n</strong><br>\n<code><strong>We can - and must - end the tyranny of the bullies on an individual, local, global and even universal level.</strong></code><code> Not by violent means, but by simply being authentic - </code><code><em>by creating new attitudes and paradigms, new ways of living and interacting which benefit the many, not just the few; and which honour our true nature, not the whims of the bullies.</em></code></p>\n<p><em><strong>Because there IS an action which could end all of this right now: a show of solidarity by the sane members of the population. </strong></em><em>All it takes is awareness of the situation, a bit of backbone, and the common sense ability to count the numbers.<br>\n</em><em><strong><br>\n</strong></em><strong>You see, the bullies in question didn\u2019t only bully me, and they didn\u2019t make any attempt to hide the fact that they were bullies.</strong> Their twisted, troubled, power-seeking antics were right there in everyone\u2019s faces. Look around you at world events, at the grown-up bullies who blatantly lead the masses to war, and slaughter the innocent in innumerable quantities. The parallels are there - I\u2019m not making them up, or retro-fitting world events to fit my 'traumatised world-view'.<br>\n<br>\nAlthough the vast majority of those around me felt what those kids were doing to be wrong, they carried on regardless, or felt powerless to intervene. Apply that learned hopelessness, that failure to step in, that failure to stand up and be counted when we know something to be wrong? That, right there, is our undoing. This turning away will be the death of us. The turning away IS the death of us, in every sense imaginable.<br>\n<br>\nConversely, <strong>facing our true feelings and acting upon them, facing the truth and living it, is the only way out of this mess.<br>\n</strong><br>\nSchool bullies, political bullies, warmongers, yes-men and doormats - authoritarian structures produce them. It\u2019s all one thing, it\u2019s all happening over and over again; a pattern repeating ad infinitum until 'I', the individual, realise and exercise my own wonderful natural power. <em>This power can then be used in a life-serving way, to take care of and be in flow with myself, my environment, my fellow beings.</em> In that moment, the bullies in the playground (both in our day-to-day reality and metaphorically speaking) cease to have power over anyone but themselves - which is to say that the natural order, or natural law, is returned to its rightful place as the guiding light in every sentient being\u2019s existence.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>The numbers ARE stacked against the bullies, make no mistake.</strong> There were about 50 children on my school bus every day, and only five of them were 'terrorists'. Of those five, one was the real troublemaker and the other four were 'henchkids': alone and without their psycho ringleader, they were really quite benign. <em>What would have happened if those 45 other children has peacefully but firmly surrounded the troublemakers and told them in no uncertain terms that their behaviour was unacceptable? What if we had repeated this action every time one of the bullies started tormenting one of us?<br>\n<br>\n</em><strong>I reckon this percentage per head of population is roughly similar in any given situation - 1% psychos and damage cases, 4% willing followers, 89% helpless souls suffering from learned helplessness, and 1% brave enough (or desperate enough) to take action.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong><br>\nThe fact of the matter is, the psychopaths, the bullies and the troubled-beyond-redemption are in a tiny minority. And we are countless multitudes.<br>\n</strong></em></p>\n<p>There are so many decent, well-intentioned people out there. On the day we realise that our compliance is what empowers them, <strong>the game is over</strong>. If defensive action IS required, it will be proportionate and will cease in the moment that its goal of restoring peace is achieved. Truth will be seen, individual authenticity will flourish and create delights and miracles we can presently only dream of. Beautiful, respected children will grow into beautiful, respectful adults, healthy and strong, free from oppression and full of wonder and glory. <strong>It will happen. &nbsp;<br>\n</strong><br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/13996190_1216134791764055_7695354668367492006_o.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\"/></p>\n<p><em>Photo - 'Playground Meditation' by Jay Taylor</em></p>\n<p><strong>I dragged myself back out of hell by facing my pain and the confusion and figuring out for myself what their causes were.</strong> I don\u2019t think about those times and I don\u2019t dwell upon their events; and I don't wish to see more children enduring such suffering when we could so easily do something else instead. Crucially, <strong>I don\u2019t repeat those mistakes because I have truly learned from them.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>One day, every \u2018I\u2019 on this planet, every \u2018I\u2019 in existence, will be able to say the same.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Because</strong></em> I have learned, I do not pass the sickness of the World on to my own child: instead, I pass on the knowledge that she has the power to co-create her own reality, and to be who and what she is without compromise. &nbsp;She has not been subjected to the daily 'sausage factory' programming regime of 'baby sheep bootcamp' - school. She HAS been validated and supported and nurtured with every ounce of love I could muster. This is not permissiveness, or conflict avoidance, or escapism. It is a conscious choice for the benefit of myself, my daughter, for the beautiful earth, and for mankind.<br>\n<br>\nUnsurprisingly to me, this truly authentic being is NOT selfish, not unkind, not power-hungry, not \u2018evil\u2019 or \u2018sinful\u2019 or flawed in any way: exactly the opposite is true.<br>\n<strong><br>\nSince I can raise a child who \u201csees truth regardless of appearances\u201d, &nbsp;I see that plainly </strong><em><strong>it can be done.</strong></em> Even in less than ideal circumstances (after all, the global and small scale bullies still reign supreme). And all I have really done is facilitate her interests and protect her right to be who she is, and do what she does.<br>\n<br>\nBorn primed to be a social creature, born curious and focussed and bright and adventurous, we do not need to be forced into a mould, or taught how to be what we already are. Freedom, wisdom, truth, balance, laughter, love, warmth, creativity, insight - all of these are our birthright. All we have to do is realise it, to value and reclaim it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Clearly this is far easier to achieve if one is born into a supportive environment</strong>, guided by those who respect and value you, who see you as an equal and a partner, and who insist wherever possible that others do the same. And this has been, and continues to be, my mission. As a parent, I walk hand in hand with my child, guiding her with my experience where helpful, not programming her to repeat it or shielding her from her own. Along the way, I have learned more from her than I have learned from anybody else in human form.<br>\n<br>\n<em>She also happens to be the best company, and the best friend, anyone could ever wish for. She is intelligent, funny, observant, knowledgeable - all this, and never set foot inside a school in her life... whoever woulda thunk it? ;o)</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8488/8188059242_895374b59f_o.jpg\" alt=\"Bubble Girl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"/></p>\n<p><em>Photo - </em><a href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/jaytaylor/works/5678590-bubble-girl\"><em><strong>'Bubble Girl'</strong></em></a><em> by </em><a href=\"http://www.jaytaylor.co.uk/\"><em><strong>Jay Taylor</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How difficult is it to achieve, this 'unschooling' process; this process of bringing in the new?

When it comes to do something for a person that you know, there are many factors that can guide you in your decision making, how you will do and how you will prioritize this in your life.</p>\n<p>Generally we live in a way that we had a formed routine, especially when we work full time. Of course it is difficult to add new tasks for a short routine that already is fully progam.</p>\n<p>When someone asks for a favor,<strong> you can act in order not to prioritize</strong> that was asked to you. Because the fact of making free, <strong>makes less valuable the request</strong> for you to add into your routine. But <strong>when we win something</strong> to do that favor, &nbsp;we tend to <strong>treat more seriously the request</strong>. <em><strong>I will explain to you my experience;</strong></em></p>\n<h1><strong>The favor</strong></h1>\n<p>A friend of mine from work asked me to extract an audio from a DVD that he had to convert the songs to MP3 and add the songs in a pen drive, so they could hear them in the car, or on TV. It turns out that this friend does not have the necessary knowledge to do this task, which is simple.</p>\n<p>For me it's something very simple to do, <strong>but in my routine I have little free time during the week</strong>, which makes it difficult to do anything different this routine. And he wanted me to do from one day to the other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now I want to explain how I reacted when the favor was free, and when the favor would a cash reward;</p>\n<h1><strong>The favor for free</strong></h1>\n<p>As i said before, when someone asks us to do something, usually we tend to give less priority when we have little time and when this favor is for free. So when he asked me to do that, what went through my mind is that i even could do, but it would be the in the day i wanted and when i had time available, it would be at the weekend.</p>\n<p>I accepted, but with little interest and little desire. I considered a boring task to add to my routine because I wanted to rest and have fun, even if it is something simple to do.</p>\n<h1>The favor for money</h1>\n<p>At that moment everything changed. He wanted the work done on the same day, then to make that happen, he offered me a sum of money for the work. Starting that moment I changed completely because now I needed to do, after all I was being paid, and would have to do well.</p>\n<p>The simples and boring task has become a simple and boring task that needed to be done, after all she <strong>\"had gained value.\"</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>In the end I would do the task, after all it was a favor for a friend. But mind you, when he would not offer anything,<strong> the favor was considered unimportant</strong>, I could postpone and do when I wanted to. But starting the moment he offered me money,<strong> a contract was created, and a responsibility was established</strong>. I needed to do at the time he wanted, even considering difficult for the little time I have.</p>\n<h1>How does this relate to steemit</h1>\n<p>Imagine that you are a writer, but you're living in favor stage of something that are made for free, as I defined.</p>\n<p>You have little time to use the steemit in your routine. Then see what happens over time. Each new post that you make, if she did not pay any money or little money, the tendency is you consider that this is a waste of your time. You feel that you are doing something for free, as I felt at the time to do the favor.</p>\n<p><strong>Over time, this feeling makes you stop using the platform. </strong>And I believe this is one of the main reasons why people tend to leave the platform. <strong>They feel that they are doing something for free, they think that they are not favored when compared with people who are successful in steemit.</strong></p>\n<p>The opposite is also true. When people start to post and be successful, managing to transform texts in cash they begin to create responsibilities within the platform, and tend to want to grow and write useful things for people to read.</p>\n<h2>To finish</h2>\n<p>These social contracts that exist in the relationship between people, both in the real as much as in virtual, really need to be taken more serious.</p>\n<p><strong>What we do, for whom we do and how we do </strong>will depend on what we will gain in return.<strong> After all this is the base that moves everything in this world.</strong> People do not are on the steemit because they like to write or like the platform. They are simply reacting in different ways with a new and revolutionary way to make money on texts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/49luma0tz/68_Hwpt2.jpg\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "Yes, I did it! Today is my first day of school. It was a hard path to get back to class, but I have been determined and now here I am, at the school library, writing this post.\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.steemit.com/@queenmountain\"><img src=\"http://queenmountain.com/images/school/school1.jpg\"/></a>\n\n> Here is a little softer side of me, the more artsy, nerdy, librarian GiGi. \n\n## It took a lot of convincing that school was worth pursuing again. ##\n\n\nhttp://queenmountain.com/images/school/school2.jpg\n\nI mean, look at all the negativity circulating about higher education. Between ginormous student loan debt and young people waiting tables with bachelor's degrees, school has gotten a pretty bad rap.\n\nI am sure many of you on here can relate to staggering student loan debt. So can I.\n\n\nhttp://queenmountain.com/images/school/school3.jpg\n\nI started out my journey of higher education 12 years ago. As a single mom, I worked, went to school full-time, qualified for some grants, and I still had to take out student loans.\n\nI made it through 2 years of full-time school and received all of my general education credits (minus 2 courses, which I am taking now). However, my life took a nose-dive and I was unable to attend school and care for my child. \n\n## BUT the STUDENT LOANS still LOOMED. ##\n\n\nhttp://queenmountain.com/images/school/school4.jpg\n\nThe Federal Stafford and Sallie Mae Loan agencies have been lurking in the background of my life, reminding me that I need to complete my higher education. After all, what is the point of carrying the debt if I had nothing to show for it??\n\nSo for the past 12 YEARS, I have been trying to get back to school. \n\n\nhttp://queenmountain.com/images/school/school5.jpg\n>I <3 Library!!!\n\nAnd I did it. I finally did it. \n\nI had to put my foot down, I had to make the conscious decision that I would make it back this semester NO MATTER WHAT.\n\n# Major . . . ? #\n\n\nhttp://queenmountain.com/images/school/school6.jpg\n\nStill, I am unclear as to what exactly I will be majoring in. At first, I decided on a solid Business Marketing degree (bachelor's). Then, I realized that I would not be happy with that career path. I have been an entrepreneur, freelancer, and small business owner for a good chunk of my adult life. So I figured business would be the natural course of things, right? WRONG. Well, at least for me. \n\nWhen I looked at the course of study, I kinda puked a little bit in my mouth. Microeconomics, macroeconomics, statistics . . . Was not happening. I then had an epiphany that a degree in Business was prepping students to climb the corporate ladder. Uh, no thanks. If you have been following my blog, you will most definitely see that I am nowhere near any type of corporate personality.\n\n\nhttp://queenmountain.com/images/school/school7.jpg\n>I found my personal little study nook on the third level of the library.\n\nThen, I made a conscious consideration of changing my major to ART. Yes, a Bachelor's in Art. I posted about it and got quite a hefty response (and a dose of reality, thanks Steemians!) and have reconsidered my choice. \n\nhttps://steemit.com/life/@queenmountain/i-m-making-a-huge-decision-in-my-life-i-am-switching-my-major-from-business-to-art\n\nFor now, I have decided to focus on my last 2 prerequisites, and settle on a degree in the spring. I am thinking possibly a double Major in Art and English, focusing on technical writing (GREAT profession that makes good $$$) . . . I might even add a teaching credential to the mix. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Does anyone have a major in either of these? Teaching? Art? English? How about technical writing? I would love feedback. \n\n\nhttp://queenmountain.com/images/school/school8.jpg\n\nTo end this blog, I have decided that I will be contributing more brain to Steemit as I learn interesting and juicy tidbits in my studies. I have focused primarily on contributing my adventures in Montana to Steemit. And I will continue to do so. The point is that I want to CONTRIBUTE here, and create unique quality posts for you all to enjoy and learn from.\n\nThis semester I am taking \"Religious Quest\" and \"Biology 101\" . . . Prereqs, ugh. Although I do feel that I will enjoy them.\n\nIn the end, I just love to learn :) \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.steemit.com/@queenmountain\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"http://queenmountain.com/images/logo/starry.gif\"/></a>",

In this article I'm going to share some tips, which helped me to fulfill my dream. These steps are not new or unique. I think you\u2019ve heard about them many times before, but each tip is proved by my personal experience. &nbsp;</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I hope that my story will inspire some of you to follow your dream. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/p206x206/14137720_1152745071451231_1512205086_n.jpg?oh=eb74c01004bbbda78faeb92ea44a515b&amp;oe=57C1203A\" width=\"314\" height=\"206\"/></p>\n\n<h3>Tip #1: Have a dream.</h3>\n<p>May be it sounds a bit strange or even ridiculous, but life without a dream is empty and gray. I think every living person has a dream, but sometimes we don't have time or desire to think about it. Just listen to your heart, it will help you to see your dream. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>When I was a little girl\u2026</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have been dreaming about ice skates since my childhood. I often tried to put on my brother\u2019s broken old ice skates or to craft roller skates of toy car wheels. I watched every figure skating world championship and, of course, I wanted to be an Olympic champion. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulties\u2026&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I was born in Grozny, it is a capital of Chechen Republic. Grozny is located in the territory of North Caucasus. The nature in Caucasus is amazing: Stone mountains with sharp snowy peaks; rapid mountain rivers, which roar is louder than city transport noise. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/p206x206/14111839_1152740994784972_1363579305_n.jpg?oh=c92923a897ba28a3000f37c68199e6f2&amp;oe=57C0DAA1\" width=\"290\" height=\"206\"/></p>\n\n<p>My parents promised to buy me ice skates and employ a professional figure skating coach. But suddenly the war began\u2026 I hope you\u2019ve heard about the Chechen war. That was not the war between two countries, but a kind of civil war. Two cultures within one state became foes to each other. I still remember those horrible bangs and those military planes filled with bombs. That war didn\u2019t pass us by \u2013 we were robbed several times by our neighbours, but we couldn\u2019t do anything about that, as the whole city was in chaos and panic. And then someone had kidnapped my brother. It was a great distress for us. But luckily, my brother escaped and went back home. So we decided to move to another country as soon as possible. That was the toughest time in my life. We left our hometown, moved to another country. No money. My parents could not find a job in a new place. Sometimes we had nothing to eat... </p>\n<h3>Tip #2: Save money for your dream.</h3>\n<p><strong>Everything is getting better...&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I grew up and moved to a big city. I entered the University and found a job. I studied and earned some money for a living as well. And I began to save money for\u2026ice skates! &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Tip # 3: Take advice of experienced people. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Find a person who will motivate and inspire you by his/her own example. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>It is time for hard work:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I bought ice skates. In a couple of days I learned to skate. That was a breakthrough for me, but in another couple of days I was bored to skate forwards and backwards. I wanted something more \u2013 figure skating. And one day I met a person, who was pretty good at figure skating and he taught children and newbies for free. So I asked him for an advice. He taught me several figure skating elements. We became good friends; and he continued to give me ideas; he pointed at my mistakes and helped to correct them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://pp.vk.me/c629309/v629309944/15128/qdgW6JTGTso.jpg</p>\n<p>I thought that my friend was a professional sportsman, but I was shocked when I knew that he was not. Moreover, he had limited abilities! My friend was badly injured in a car crush and surgeons cut off half of his right foot! He wore a kind of prosthetic device. He began to go in for figure skating just to prove the world that he was not crippled or something like that. Wow, what a will and a desire to move forward!&nbsp;</p></div>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_9PYGYBiw</p>\n<p><em>Half of his right foot was cut off, but he can skate!</em></p>\n<div class=\"text-justify\"><h3>Tip # 4: Never stop, never! &nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong>Bruises:</strong></p>\n<p>So I started to watch figure skating video tutorials and read articles about this kind of sport. It was extremely difficult for me, because I hadn\u2019t got a personal trainer and expensive professional figure skating equipment. I started to skate at the age of 20 and I was a bit overweight at that moment. But I worked hard. Every time I was back from the skating rink, I was completely worn out. I often spent 5 or 6 hours on the skating rink and sometimes the temperature in the street was minus 17C (there were no covered ice skating rinks in the city). After the skating rink I went to the gym to do stretching exercises. I had many bruises on my knees and elbows; I even cut myself with a skating blade a couple of times. I couldn\u2019t sleep at night because all my body ached. My friends and my mom wanted me to quit skating as it was dangerous for my health. But I didn\u2019t listen to them. I did what I dreamed about. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://pp.vk.me/c630119/v630119944/4958e/3EWqXyepAjw.jpg</p>\n<p><em>I fell down again...</em></p>\n<h3>Tip # 5: Believe in yourself. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>After three years of constant practicing, I skated well and could do some figure elements. My friends liked the way I skated. But I was not satisfied with myself. Almost all the time I trained at night or early in the morning for noone to see me. I was sure that I\u2019 was not good at figure skating at all. And one day while watching video tutorial, I realized that I can do everything in that video and even more. I skated well, my progress was great, but I didn\u2019t believe in myself. The next day I went to the skating rink and showed everything I could. All the people around stared at me, and children came up to me and asked to teach them, they thought I was a professional figure skater:) That was wonderful, I felt boost of confidence!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/p206x206/14138335_1152740434785028_299617870_n.jpg?oh=2b5550654ad7f65a878c4cdece988a4a&amp;oe=57C139DD\" width=\"302\" height=\"206\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/p206x206/14138344_1152740478118357_162020745_n.jpg?oh=68706c9e50b0f6d0cf3ffe19a8cccf4d&amp;oe=57C102C6\" width=\"206\" height=\"234\"/></p>\n<p>Well, speaking about me now, I\u2019m not an Olympic champion or a professional sportsman. I can\u2019t do complicated figure skating elements. But I can say that my dream has come true. Now I continue to improve my skills. I do not regret about all these years spent on ice and roller skating rinks. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/p206x206/14089385_1152740414785030_1228867816_n.jpg?oh=8a07b62068d92221326162bfa1d3a7d7&amp;oe=57C164A1\" width=\"206\" height=\"280\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/p206x206/14137855_1152745068117898_869159135_n.jpg?oh=6f2b305bdde04880b107ce0375390b45&amp;oe=57C11837\" width=\"206\" height=\"206\"/></p>\n<p>If you have a dream, go for it. Don\u2019t give up! Rome was not built in a day. Just don\u2019t stop!&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thank you for reading. &nbsp;It wasn\u2019t easy to recall my tough childhood, but I believe that my story can be a tiny contribution to Steemit society. May be my tips will inspire some of you to continue doing what you love.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I\u2019d be happy if you follow me @victoriart.</p></div>\n</html>\n\n**Don't forget to follow @victoriart!!** \n--------------------------------------- \n\n**@crazymumzysa features authors to promote new authors and a diversity of content.

    "body": "Small and Middle-sized Towns of Russia.\n===\n\nI met a lot of people from different small and middle-sized towns of Russia. The most of them told that there\u2019s nothing to do in their towns comparing with Moscow or Saint-Petersburg. They told there\u2019re not enough opportunities in their towns, not enough places where they can go out, not enough life in general. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hQpJMPi.jpg)\n<a href=http://droplak.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/87.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\nHowever, every town is special and it\u2019s not that matter if it\u2019s small, middle-sized or big. There\u2019re different sights, nice places, its own unrepeatable atmosphere everywhere. I\u2019ll tell you about peoples\u2019 lives in the different small and middle-sized towns of our huge country, about advantages and disadvantages of the life like this. \n\nRostov-on-Don\n===\n----\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VlBqbBF.jpg)\n<a href=http://otzivy.info/_pu/5/41281217.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\nIt will be the first not a really small town about which I\u2019ll tell you about. The climate here is very soft: there\u2019s not too cold at winter in Rostov but this town has a natural south summer. Approximately one million people live in Rostov. This is not a clear town, there are a lot of different industry that poisons the air in Rostov. \n\nAlcoholism and drug addiction are spreading in this town too. What\u2019s really bad is the lack of opportunities and different cultural places. For example, there\u2019s just one cinema with one or two movies at the poster in the really small center of the city. \n\nNevertheless, there\u2019re some interesting sights in Rostov: the zoo, the House of Margarita Chernova, the Stele, the Staro - Pokrovskiy Temple and even the Closed zone. People who live in the outskirts of the town often have their own big houses, their own green gardens. However, many people want to move. \n\nMagnitogorsk\n===\n----\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pDDi6IR.jpg)\n<a href=http://nesiditsa.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Zavod-nochyu.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\nPeople from Magnitogorsk told that it was a grey, dirty and gloomy town but people who lived there were very good, kind and responsive. The town is divided on two parts: right and left coast. There\u2019s a Steel Works Company on the left side. The town lives generally because of this Steel Works Company in economical way. The most of people are working on this facility, consequently, there\u2019re no problems with unemployment in Magnitogorsk. \n\nNowadays it\u2019s really difficult to find a free work place at this company. However, it\u2019s getting bigger. The middle level of wages is 25 000 rubles per month. The biggest part of salary is going on food. You can have a lot of fun in this town because it has two ski resorts near. You can have a rest and go there to breath with some of fresh air a little bit. \nPeople in Magnitogorsk are good enough. \n\nHowever, they smoke and drink too much. Moreover, there\u2019re a lot of young stupid girls and people who are ready to fight without any case and rob you after that. We call them \u00abGopniki\u00bb in Russia. \nAnyway, many people want to move because not everyone wants to work at the factory for the whole life in a very dirty, grey town. They have goals that they want to achieve, they need opportunities, they need to go to another, more breathtaking and useful place. \n\nOmsk\n===\n----\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hWEYi8X.jpg)\n<a href=http://voinskayachast.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/omsk_sobor3.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\n\u00abThe Omsk is a very good town\u00bb, - told me the most of people who lived in Omsk for a while. Yes, the roads are just awful, like the most of common Russian broken roads. Of course, there\u2019re some problems with beautification and transport. Anyway, this town has its own beautiful ancient soul. Green parks and zones, not too much emigrants. Moreover, there\u2019s not that much city vanity that is a significant characteristic of the big cities. \n\nThat\u2019s strange that habitants of this town say really bad things about their native town. What\u2019s about architecture in Omsk? That\u2019s just beautiful! Tarskaya street has been the historical center of the town before 2013. It has been a well-organized place for having a rest and walking. You was able to relax there and spend all free time with your friends. The street finishes by the exit to the Holy Cross Cathedral. \n\nMany habitants of Omsk like their town and don\u2019t want to move anywhere. They just want to see how the life abroad is going on, but just for a while. However, people who have great aspirations or dreams don\u2019t have enough opportunities here just like in every small town. They want to move in the big city in Russia, Europe or America to realize their dreams. Anyway, some of them try to achieve their goals or even to start do it here. \n\nDreams\n===\n----\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ELomr8H.jpg)\n <a href=http://static.tonkosti.ru/images/b/b5/%D0%91%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%80,_%D0%9D%D1%8C%D1%8E-%D0%99%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BA.jpg>Image Source</a>\n\nDespite of the fact that every town is special in its own way, many people from small and middle-sized towns often try to go to live to bigger towns like Moscow and Saint-Petersburg or even abroad. Of course, the forest around, the memories about the previous life and a simple attachment to the native place are really important and convincing arguments to stay. \n\nHowever, there\u2019re not a lot of opportunities and interesting places like clubs, cafes, shops, big companies and even stores. People want to realize their dreams. The most of them are really want to go to Russian cities, to Europe or to America because they see there the perfect life with many different opportunities there. Everyone wants to open himself, to realize himself, to achieve his goals. \n\nThese dreams and aspirations get many people decide to go to one of the big cities or even abroad. \n\n\n<em>Thank you for your attention!\n\n<em>@kental with you!\n\n<em>Let's learn the Russia with me!\n\n<em><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kental\">Follow me</a> If you want to learn more about the world! </em>",

    "body": "<html>\n<h1><center><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/75e42a8e72.jpg\" width=\"850\" height=\"475\"/></center></h1>\n<h1>Sunday Night Storm</h1>\n<p>A monster thunderstorm moved through here last night. Heavy, booming thunder. Lightning that crackled until it felt like the air was filled with electricity and buzzed like killer bees. I jumped up in bed, checked the clock and groaned.&nbsp;<em>3 AM! &nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>Then I focused on the thunder, lightning, and especially the rain that was just starting to fall outside the bedroom window. It was windy and I knew all of the second floor windows were open with only the screens between us the storm. I punched Mike in the shoulder and his even snoring stopped. He growled something and rolled toward me on the bed. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"It's raining. You should shut the windows,\" I said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Rain's good for the grass,\" he replied and rolled away from me. I couldn't argue with that logic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After days of heat and humidity, the cool air blowing through the window felt really good. I threw off the covers, rolled toward the window, and went back to sleep.&nbsp;I was just too tired to close those windows.</p>\n<h1>Monday Morning</h1>\n<p>Morning dawned cool and cloudy. The storm had passed. After the alarm went off on my phone, I slapped at it, which bought me 10 more minutes of sleep. When Sam the cat started whacking me on the face with his paw, I knew it was time to get up. &nbsp;When Sam's hungry, no one can sleep. Mike was already in the shower, so I checked all of the windows before going downstairs to make some life-saving coffee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I found wet window sills, soaked carpeting, and damp curtains. \"But the grass does look good,\" I thought, looking out the window. We did have quite a few tree branches down on the front lawn though. I put towels out to soak up some of the wetness. &nbsp;Hopefully, we'd avoid mildew. &nbsp;I padded downstairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>The Shit Hits the Fan</h1>\n<p>At the bottom of the stairs, I nearly stepped on the biggest hairball Sam had ever horked up. It was a prize winner! I cleaned it up and went into the kitchen, shaking my head. I started the coffee, threw some cat food into a bowl for Sam, and went into the living room.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I clicked on the t.v. to check the morning news. All I got was a lot of static. I turned it off and on. Same result. Anger started to build and I said, \"Holy shit what's next?\" Mike came into the living room and handed me a cup of coffee. He looked at the static on the t.v. and said, \"Well, that's better than the usual political crap.\" I laughed. \"It's broken,\" I replied and drank my coffee. He checked the cable set-up, plugs and played with the remote. \"Yeah, definitely broken,\" he agreed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was then that I noticed my small, backup &nbsp;Dell laptop across the room was on the coffee table and turned off. I had set it up to mine steem, the cryptocurrency, &nbsp;the night before. When we went to bed, it was still synching up with all of the blocks. I figured we'd be rolling in steem power when we woke up. &nbsp;Panic washed over me. We had 3 laptops and other electronics plugged into power strips. What if Mother Nature had fried them all?</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/76afa21664.jpg\" width=\"215\" height=\"336\"/></center></p>\n<p>I went over to take a closer look.&nbsp;The laptop was completely off. I took a healthy gulp of coffee and put the cup on the coffee table. I sat down on the couch and pressed the power button on the Dell. Nothing. More panic came for a visit. So I checked all of the cable connections and plugs and tried again. This time the power light came on. I smiled at my success.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two seconds later the laptop started making a clicking sound that started low, accelerated and went back to low. &nbsp;It didn't boot up. &nbsp;I'd never heard that particular sound before. \"Uh oh,\" I said, giving Mike my moment of doom look.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Internal power supply?\" he asked.&nbsp;I shrugged. Neither of us were super techie when it came to hardware. I closed my eyes and did some deep breathing. I felt my body relax a bit and my blood pressure came down. </p>\n<p>Mike sat down on the couch and turned on my other laptop. It's my workhorse for writing, curating, &nbsp;email...everything! I held my breath. I do copy data off to an external drive. But still.... &nbsp;Seconds later it booted up!! Everything looked good. I did the fist pump of joy. He checked the power strip and said it looked like it was still working.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mike then went to the smaller couch on the opposite wall. Our living room is where we both work and relax. Mike's laptop sat on a wooden coffee table. He turned it on and it booted up too. We were happy but confused. It looked like we'd experienced a selective power spike. Why had the older laptop died but my workhorse computer survived? They were both plugged into the same power strip. Had someone hacked my laptop because I was going to be an extremely wealthy steem miner?&nbsp;(Not likely).</p>\n<h1>The Plan</h1>\n<p>We ate breakfast and put together a plan. Mike had a meeting later in the morning. So I said I'd call Comcast and see what they needed to do to get our cable t.v. back. Mike said he'd call his brother, Cal, and ask him to come over and look at the laptop this weekend. Cal was a techno-wizard. As an afterthought, I said I'd stop at a pet store and get the goop you give cats so they don't gift you with enormous hairballs first thing in the morning. &nbsp;<strong>We had a plan!</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/786a34541c.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"707\"/></center></p>\n<p>To celebrate we made a dinner date at Palermo's, one of our favorite restaurants. Mike got dressed and went off to his meeting. \"It'll all work out, slugger,\" he said with a grin as he went out the door. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I was heading up to take a shower when Mike came back in the door. \"Forget something?\" I asked. Then I saw his face. \"I have a flat tire and just enough time to change it,\" he said. I went over to him and hugged him and then we broke down in hysterical laughter. We couldn't stop. I ended up rolling on the floor.</p>\n<h1>Lessons Learned</h1>\n<p><strong>So what do you do when life serves you shit for breakfast? Here's what I learned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Whatever happens, it's probably not the end of the world. It may feel like it, especially if a bunch of crappy things happen close to each other. But it is Not.The.End.Of.The.World.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Don't explode at yourself or others. It may feel good for a split second, but really doesn't help the situation.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Stay calm, do deep breathing, try some spot meditation to relax. You'll cope and make better decisions if you're relaxed.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>For the love of God, Keep your sense of humor! Laughter is a great way of relaxing and relieving stress.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Figure out what each problem that you're facing involves. Is it a technical problem? Is it a social problem? Is it a work problem? Can you solve any or all of the problems you're facing? If not, who can you contact to help you resolve the problems?&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Make a plan.&nbsp;Just writing down each problem and how you plan to tackle it will help. It will give you more control.</li>\n  <li>Don't blame yourself or your partner. Shit happens and playing the blame game doesn't help.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Execute the plan you developed. As you get the right people involved to help solve each problem, you'll feel much, much better. If you have a partner, divide up the steps to solving the problems between you.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>If you don't have a partner, call the person you're closest to and talk about the crisis of the day you were faced with and your plan for addressing the problem. Get their opinion. Just talking about it with a sympathetic person will help.&nbsp;Then execute your plan with confidence!</li>\n  <li>Plan a treat for yourself so that you have something fun to look forward to when all of the chaos has been resolved. It could be ice cream, dinner with someone close to you, a night out with the girls or guys, a movie. Make it something fun!&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you wake up and the world serves you shit for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, try these steps. Not only will you solve the various problems that you face, but you'll feel 100% better about <em><strong>How</strong></em> you solved those problems. And at the end of the day you'll get a treat too!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Photos: Pexels.com, Pixabay.com</p>\n<p><strong>If you liked this post please follow me at </strong><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@nubchai\"><strong>@nubchai </strong></a><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me know what you think in the Comments.</strong></p>\n\n</html>",

    "body": "Hi Steam, who are not familiar with me - my name is Elvira and I live in the countryside. In the summer-autumn period we stock up for the winter with everything you need, including a nuts. \n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/b32935f066.jpg\n\nThere are many types of nuts - and cedar, and walnuts, and almonds, and hazelnuts and cashews, and pistachios, and peanuts, and chestnut, and nutmeg and pecans, and Brazil nuts, and the most expensive - of macadamia. But we will talk about the hazelnut, which matures in Russia in late August - early September. Nuts retain their beneficial properties for a long time, so they can be used in the winter season as a source of protein, minerals and vitamins that are very important for rural areas, so every year we collect the goodies.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/b32d599546.jpg\n\nCollection hazel produce directly from the bush, along with wrappers and dried them. Then filbert nuts free of wrappers, to dry in the home, spread out thinly.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/b362ad389c.jpg\n\n\n<h2>Some useful properties, and their really very much:</h2>\n\nThe presence of vitamin E and maintenance of large amounts of protein in the nuclei of hazelnut allows you to strengthen the muscles, which is very important for me as a sportstmena. Useful solid matter contained in the fruit, prolong life and rejuvenate the tissues of the body as a whole. People who eat hazelnuts, do not have a tendency to form kidney stones. Owing to its large amount of paclitaxel hazelnuts, it is used to deal with cancer cells. In the early stages, when mutating cells a little more, paclitaxel destroys them. Suffice daily have two or three hazelnut kernel, thereby performing preventive oncology. Invaluable useful properties of hazelnut for men. It's no secret that the hazelnut increases potency and helps to improve the state of men's health. The best nuts on virility only affects honey. Better than nuts man's force is influenced only honey. Mix of nuts with one tablespoon of honey should be eaten every evening several hours prior to a dream. And in several days quite possibly that to you will have no time for a dream.\n\nBe healthy!\n\nVote for the post. Share with your friends.\n\nPS: I've always wanted to plant this shrub in his yard. I will try it in the fall to plant a few bushes.\n\nPlease follow me\n<a href=\"https://steemit.com/@panther\">@panther</a>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>I was 9 years old, doing what 9 year olds do, I was in my neighbors yard playing with her dog when I realized I couldn't move. I laid in her front yard frozen in pain, not knowing what was happening to me or that it wasn't normal. My neighbors mom called us inside for dinner and I still couldn't move, she realized something was wrong and ran over to me in a panic. I had shortness of breath from the pain and she yanked the back of my shirt up to see what was causing it. The muscles surrounding my spine were spasming to the point of paralysis. I laid in her front yard sobbing until my mother came to retrieve me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The following day I went to see my pediatrician, per my mother\u2019s insistence just to be sure that I was okay. These muscle spasms had been happening for several months at that point, but had never been that strong or painful, I had just never told my parents about it. My doctor bent me over, ran his hand down my spine, announced that I had Severe Idiopathic Scoliosis and went silent. I had no idea what that meant but by the look on my doctors face I knew it was bad, so I cried in the exam room not really knowing what the hell it was.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/7819cc6db2.jpg\" width=\"365\" height=\"220\"/>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/health-guide/scoliosis.html\">(Image Source)</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I was 10 by the time we got in to see a specialist about my condition, and both of my parents took off work to take me so I figured it was pretty serious. I remember walking through the halls of this massive hospital not knowing what I had in store. The 3 hour wait to be seen was probably one of the most nerve wracking things for a 10 year old who didn't know what was happening. I took in my surroundings, the other children and their parents that were in the waiting room, wondering what was wrong with them, and why they were there. Where they like me?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>My doctor was stern, with a constant frown and he had 6 male doctors following his footsteps. I was intimidated and terrified to have these large male figures looming over me with such critical eyes. I clearly remember sitting on the exam table in a gown and panties feeling extremely uncomfortable because of all the adult males in the room with me being so scarcely dressed. He sent me for an x-ray and we regrouped shortly after. He was firm and straightforward with his words telling my parents I had limited options. I had a severe case, one of the worst he had seen that had not been caught sooner. My thoracic curve was 38 degrees, and my lumbar was pushing 50 degrees. No matter what we did his goal was to even the curves so I would look and stand more like a normal and typical young female. He suggested a body brace or surgery, and left the decision to my parents. My parents acknowledged the fact I was a candidate for surgery but opted for the brace instead, this was probably one of the hardest decisions they ever had to make in regards to my health.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>That afternoon I went to be fitted for my new brace. We drove across town to a smaller set of doctors offices and went back to be fitted. The man that fit me for my brace was an older man, he wore extremely tight fitting clothing and had a mustache with a constant smirk underneath. He made me strip down to nothing but my bra and panties (yet again making me extremely uncomfortable for a 10 year old) and make me put on something similar to panty hose that covered my whole torso and over my butt. He then proceeded to take measuring tape and wrapped it around my body in various places, announcing the measurements then saying \u201csubtract two inches\u201d after each one, as his nurse wrote them on a chart. I was so embarrassed, I remember staring at the floor while he yanked the tape around my body while I felt exposed in front of all the people in the room.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/78232ceec6.jpg\" width=\"629\" height=\"629\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.leeprosthetic.com/so-boston_brace.html\">(Example of Boston Brace)</a></p>\n<p>Roughly a month later we went to pick up my handmade Boston Brace, fitted just for me and my crooked ass spine. After making sure the brace fit me properly he gave my parents instructions on how to fit me in it and secure it properly we were sent home. The brace was my worst enemy. I couldn't wear my normal clothes or sit/lay like I normally would have, I could barely breathe, and it was hot as hell. I knew that it was probably best for me so I wore it daily, for 16 hours a day. I was required to wear a thin white tank top underneath it to prevent chafing and had to buy elastic clothing to fit over the brace which protruded from my body up to 6 inches in certain places. It was meant to hold my body in such a way that it restricted my spine from growing more curved, and if it did it would even the curves to be closer in number rather then one worse then the other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Over the course of the next several years I went to see my orthopedic surgeon twice a year and was fitted for a second brace as I grew out of my first one. I wore a brace for almost 4 years and didn't go a single day without wearing it, in fear of my spine getting any worse. I was prescribed physical therapy by my pediatrician and continued it until I graduated high school.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/780aae3bf2.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"/></p>\n<p>(Post-bracing X-Ray.. My curves reduced!)</p>\n<p>Fast forward to my senior year of high school, I was happy, brace free and had put my spine in the back of my mind pretending I had nothing wrong. It was nearly 18 when a woman side swiped my car as I was driving to help my best friend pick out her prom dress. Being a petite person, the seatbelt caught my hip, and my neck holding them in place while the impact jerked the rest of my body to the left. I was unaware of the damage it had done to my body because of the adrenaline and sheer fury that I felt. The woman driving the blue minivan that hit me was driving on sleeping medication, admitted this to the police officer and was tried for driving under the influence. I didn't know how this was going to affect my life, but I knew it wasn't going to be good.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Less then a week later I went to an after hours clinic desperate for answers as to why I was so incredibly miserable from my back. They did multiple x-rays and when the doctors walked in with the results I knew I was in trouble. My spine was broken in multiple places in my thoracic and lumbar spine, and my neck was severely out of alignment. So, back to the orthopedic surgeon I went.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>He was extremely harsh. The older I got the more I realized how much I disliked his attitude towards my condition. \u201cScoliosis is a PAIN FREE disease.\u201d He would preach to me. \u201cYou aren't feeling pain, it\u2019s just your Type A mind playing tricks on you.\u201d He infuriated me and I would retaliate saying, \u201cYou don't have scoliosis, you don't KNOW how it feels.\u201d His response was always the same, \u201cI wrote a BOOK on Scoliosis I KNOW how it feels.\u201d I hated that he would try to push his perception of what I was feeling, on me. He told me at my last appointment that I had 3 bulging discs and that if one or all of them ruptured I had the possibility of being paralyzed from the waist down. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re fine.\u201d He would condescendingly tell me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>To be continued.&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

Your computer has not exploded, your chair has not collapsed, the trees outside produce fruits, the air is breathable and the sun will rise once again tomorrow. \n&nbsp;\nThe entire solar system seems stable enough to keep you alive. The reality though is bit more complicated than that. Order, as we have come to identify it, is practically non existent. What we perceive around us as order, is nothing but a photographic snapshot of the consequential aftermath of chaos. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nhttp://cosmopolitascotland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/communication1unknownartist.jpg\n<a hre=\"http://cosmopolitascotland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/communication1unknownartist.jpg\">image credit</a>\n<p><h2>Linguistically Ignorant</h2>\nUltimately, our ignorance is what creates the idea of order. As primitive beings, we could not make sense of our surroundings so we invented stories to make sense of the world. The stories became language, religions, culture. One only has to consider where the word 'order' comes from; or better, the word 'nothing'. In reality there is never such thing as nothing. If we open our hand, we are still holding molecules of oxygen, bacteria, dust, food particles among other things. We merely use the word nothing in order to explain the world from our own perspective and make sense of our own personal affairs, not that of physical reality. </p>\n<p>The word 'order' functions in much the same way. It doesn\u2019t really exist. It just helps us classify items. If order was really something, governments would not constantly try to create laws or print money to save economies. Same applies with medication that provides us health, or cosmetics that make us look younger. They are nothing but a small dilation in the timeline of chaos. This is why when we stop using any of the above reality hits us harder than before. In the words of Ayn Rand: </p>\n\n>You Can Avoid Reality, But You Cannot Avoid the Consequences of Avoiding Reality\n\n&nbsp;\nhttp://sites.middlebury.edu/middmag/files/2012/08/mayfly.jpg\n<a href=\"http://sites.middlebury.edu/middmag/files/2012/08/mayfly.jpg\">image credit : mayfly</a>\n<p><h2>A Short-Sighted Mayfly</h2>\nFrom our limited perspective, we experience order much like a mayfly living inside a car. The mayfly doesn\u2019t realise that the car is moving 130 miles per hour, ready to crash and burn into non-existence. It\u2019s size in respect to the car\u2019s velocity makes the car appear a safe, stable environment, providing oxygen and breeding ground. Mayflies only live for 24 hours. One cannot imagine how such a short lifespan is perceived. It enjoys the order of the car\u2019s ecosystem since it is the only thing it has ever known.</p>\n<p>We are no different than the mayfly. Although we do live an average of 73 years or more, the universe doesn\u2019t care about this little fact. Our universe is at least 14 billion years old. Our lifespan or the mayfly\u2019s perspectively to the universe is insignificant. The mayfly lives on a moving car\u2019s carpet while we live on a rock floating through a desolate dark space. The mayfly might have had 10-15 generations inside the car in just under a month. We, as a species, existed on this earth for about 200.000 years. In respect to the earth\u2019s lifespan, we are much like a mayfly living inside a moving car. </p>\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nhttp://il3.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/12404630/thumb/1.jpg\n<a href=\"http://il3.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/12404630/thumb/1.jpg\">image credit : monitor pixels</a>\n<p><h2>Zoom In, Zoom Out</h2>\nDays pass in our lives and nothing seems to change really. We grow up, go to school, get married, have our own kids but then if an unfortunate event occurs, we immediately seek order. It is as if we are unaware that every single event around us is governed by chaos. We have difficulty accepting that a life event, whatever it might be, is just more entropy introduced into the system. </p>\n<p>About ~300.000 bacteria rule our bodies on a daily basis, fighting each other, controlling every single hormone and neurotransmitter secreted in our bodies. The time we eat, drink and make love is controlled by those little lifeforms. We are the result of their war. They live and die for us. We are the universe of those bacteria. Whether we spontaneously develop cancer, or miraculously recover from it, it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference to them. The effect is only perceived by us as living beings. Chaos rules those events all the time. Order is only perceived when standing from a specific distance. In our case it is just an average lifespan of 75 rotations of our planet in respect to it\u2019s home star. <p> \n<p>The hurricane that killed thousands of people is as chaotic as the earthquakes that made volcanoes on earth sprout and provide a sustainable atmosphere. Forest fires, species going extinct, people dying while others are being born, all are part of chaos. Never order. We try to make sense of these incomprehensible events by building religious narratives or manufacturing spiritual fairytales about karma, positive thinking and maybe, just maybe an afterlife \u2014 or a place of some sort where we can live forever. It is as if we were desperately trying to hang on from a lie; one that if we repeat long enough can become true. The very idea of paradise flourishes because deep inside we understand that the world is chaotic; but we don\u2019t want to accept it. Perhaps this is also why we cry at funerals even if we believe our loved ones are in a better place. Are they really?<p>\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nhttp://orig01.deviantart.net/8c7d/f/2010/350/f/e/chaos_and_disorder_by_tabasco_raremaster-d3503jd.png\n<a href=\"http://orig01.deviantart.net/8c7d/f/2010/350/f/e/chaos_and_disorder_by_tabasco_raremaster-d3503jd.png\">image credit</a>\n<p><h2>Perspective</h2>\nWe are a by-product of entropy. We are certainly not the center of the universe as many would like to believe. This world was not build for us. We are merely a random result of it. Douglas Adams explains this concept with a story about a puddle of mud, suddenly gaining consciousness;</p>\n\n>This is rather as if you imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in \u2014 an interesting hole I find myself in \u2014 fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for \u2014 Douglas Adams, The Salmon of Doubt\n\nIn the course of our lifespan, we continuously introduce more and more entropy struggling to stay alive. Truth is, since our conception, we are all constantly degrading, dying. A child born with leukemia perceives order in a vastly different way compared to someone else who is in his 20\u2019s and never really had to go the doctor. Miracles and luck work much the same way. There are people who swear that they saw an image of their God right before an accident and as a result they were saved. We hear this so often simply because the vast majority who also went through a similar experience is now dead. We perceive order in a form of illusion collecting only the data that suit us; never those that seem to go against us. Like Donald Rumsfeld has put it:\n\n>There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we don't know we don't know. \n\nOnly instantaneously we exist as tiny orderly islands in the ocean of chaos. In much the same way, inside a star, hydrogen atoms fuse in an instant to create heavier elements. Up until then they had been orderly. From the perspective of the hydrogen atoms this is chaotic and unsettling. From the perspective of the star it owes to happen so that it can exist.\n\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2016/07/19/07/41/bacteria-1527639_960_720.jpg\n<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2016/07/19/07/41/bacteria-1527639_960_720.jpg\">image credit : bacteria</a>\n\nThe 350.000 kinds of aforementioned microbes living inside of us, disturb the order of each other much like the hydrogen does inside a star. Microbes fight or cooperate with each other depending on their numbers. In the same respect a general sees war as order, where a refugee sees it as chaos. What is chaos for the fly is order for the spider. In all cases, order is nothing more but the illusion held by the eyes of the beholder.\n\nPhysics seem to agree with the notion of chaos as well. The second law of thermodynamics in combination with special relativity do not allow order to take place. A parallel to this concept would be taking a screenshot of your computer while playing a movie. The pixels producing the screenshot seem stationary. It is as if they sit tightly to produce an orderly image of your favourite actor. In fact, those tiny switches, produce a random sequence of photons that are perceived sensibly through your brain when you stand far enough. Glue your eyes on the computer screen and you won\u2019t make sense of anything. \n\nIn much the same way we are standing now on a planet with objects light years apart from us. For a sense of perspective let us migrate to a planet in the Andromeda galaxy, the closest galaxy to our own. If we look back at earth we wouldn\u2019t even see that we exist yet. We would be looking into the past of about 250.000 years. This effect can be observed on earth as well. When one stands at the shores of a beach, gazing an approaching ship through the horizon line, one travels back in time for about one second. Nothing around us takes place in real time. It takes 490 seconds for light from the sun to reach earth and about another 20,000 years traveling from inside the sun to its surface. The universe has already ended but from our perspective we are still experiencing it. Most of the stars you see in the sky produce intensive wavelengths of radiation. When they reach earth (because they will) all life as we know it will be eradicated. It is much like watching a car coming towards you in a very slow motion, standing still, frozen, unable to do anything about it.\n&nbsp;\n\nhttp://www.freelargeimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Black_background-5.jpg\n<p><h2>Now What?</h2>\nThe understanding of life on a deeper level requires embracement of chaos as the basis of reality. Only then the world can really start making sense. Much of our suffering as individuals revolves around the denial of chaos. There are many ways to get around this barrier but first we need to shed our cultural and ideological frame. Understanding reality means rejecting everything we hold dear, whether it is science, religion or narratives about the world around us. Only then we can structure chaos to work in our favour. </p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kyriacos\"><img src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/j7spk2.png\"></a>",

But it&nbsp;has more history in its&nbsp;background than&nbsp;weed and African traditions in the Caribbean.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this post I'll&nbsp;present you some of these entries where Dreadlocks made their&nbsp;way into&nbsp;the history.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/s0ajxvd7t/Einstein_rasta.jpg\" width=\"425\" height=\"425\"/></p>\n<p>Since celebrities like Bob Marley and Whoopi Goldberg introduced this hairstyle to the showbiz, a&nbsp;lot more people got into this&nbsp;trend.&nbsp;New generations just missed the roots of that movement. But, <strong>Is it really a movement?</strong> or <strong>What is it?</strong></p>\n<p><br>\nTo talk about Dreadlocks we need to go back in time thousands of years. No!&nbsp;it didn't start with the reggae&nbsp;music in the 70's.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>From Greece&nbsp;to the Germanic tribes</h2>\n<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/5pmoxwfxl/Kourus.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"668\"/></h2>\n<p>(credits: www.metmuseum.org)</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Did you know that one of the first examples of this original hairstyle appeared on Egyptians artifacts?.....&nbsp;Mummified remains of ancient Egyptians with Dreadlocks were recovered on archaeological expeditions.</p>\n<p><br>\nAccording to the book:&nbsp;<em><strong>Twisted: My Dreadlocks Chronicles</strong></em> from Dr. Bert Ashe, written evidence found on India's Vedic scripture show the deity Shiva wearing Dreadlocks.&nbsp;The word used in the scripture is \"jaTaa\" which means \"twisted lock of hair\".</p>\n<p><br>\nThe Celts had \"hair like snakes\" according to Roman accounts. It was said that also the Vikings had dreadlocks and the ancient Greeks as well.</p>\n<p><br>\nWhat about Samson and Delilah?..... The Old Testament&nbsp;also talks about Samson's power linked directly to \"the seven locks in his head\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Dreadlocks and Spirituality</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/o6h3opvvt/40_years_Dreads.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p>(credits: www.boredpanda.com)</p>\n<p>Dreadlocks were&nbsp;symbol&nbsp;of a spiritualist's understanding that vanity and physical appearances are unimportant.</p>\n<p><br>\nDreadlocks and&nbsp;shaved head are considered as&nbsp;2 faces of the same coin, which has the same aim: disregard for vanity associated with physical appearances.</p>\n<p><br>\nShaved head \u2014 such as <a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@handmade/the-shaolin-legacy-more-than-hollywood-bald-warriors-and-kung-fu-panda\"><strong>Shaolin monks</strong></a> \u2014&nbsp;usually resonate more with those spiritualists who include elaborate&nbsp;rituals on their religious path, while those who have non-ritualistic paths prefer let the hair grow altogether and then develop Dreadlocks.</p>\n<p><br>\nIn the East, Yogis, Gyanis, and Tapasvis and in the West, the Nazarite&nbsp;are well known for developing Dreadlocks.</p>\n<p><br>\nEastern and Western traditions believe that body-mental spiritual energies exit the body through the top of the head and the hair. With knotted hair the energy remains within the body keeping the person more healthy and strong.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>African Dreadlocks</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/xsao50n1l/rift_valley_maasai_11.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"515\"/></p>\n<p>(credits: kenyamissionblog.files.wordpress.com)</p>\n<p>Maasai&nbsp;warriors are famous for their long, thin, red locks. Many people dye their hair red with root extracts or&nbsp;red ochre.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\nIn various cultures those who are known as&nbsp;shamans, spiritual men or women who serve and speak to&nbsp;spirits&nbsp;or&nbsp;deities, often wear locks.<br>\nIn Nigeria,&nbsp;some children are born with naturally locked hair and are given a special name: \"<em>Dada</em>\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yoruba&nbsp;priests of&nbsp;Olokun, the&nbsp;Orisha&nbsp;of the deep ocean, wear locks. Another group is the&nbsp;Turkana people&nbsp;of Kenya.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Around those groups in Africa this hairstyle is usually referred to as a powerful element to who is wearing it. Could be leader, warrior, priest or shaman.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Jamaican Dreadlocks</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/b4veyv7hl/Bobby_s_Dreads.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>(credits: thetab.com)</p>\n<p>Around the industrial Era, the world outside India didn't see so much Dreadlocks.<br>\nThen, at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, in Harlem&nbsp;(New York) a social-religious movement started.&nbsp;Marcus Garvey was the&nbsp;leader.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\nThe black population of Jamaica became enthusiastic followers. This group had their influences from 3 sources:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\n1. The Old and New Testament<br>\n2. &nbsp;African tribal culture and,<br>\n3. The Hindu culture that was having strong presence&nbsp;in the West Indies&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\nThose followers called themselves&nbsp;\"Dreads\". The meaning of that name was that they had fear, dread or respect for God.</p>\n<p><br>\nEmulating&nbsp;their Hindu influences, those \"Dreads\" let their hair grow and become&nbsp;locks, which will become known as \"Dreadlocks\"&nbsp;or the hairstyle of the Dreads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Rastafari Culture &amp; Dreadlocks</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/42xhco3vt/Rastafari.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"639\"/></p>\n<p>(credit: es.globalvoices.org)</p>\n<p>Rastafari is quite&nbsp;known as movement or religion but resonate more as a way of &nbsp;living or&nbsp;culture&nbsp;which appeared in Jamaica in the 30's.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\nRastafari, Rastas, Rastafarians or just Ras are some of the way that those who integrate this community are called.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\nRastas&nbsp;see&nbsp;Haile Selassie I as a&nbsp;leader and was the root of the name itself. Rastafari is taken from the Ethiopian title <em>Ras</em> that is equivalent to a chief or headmaster.&nbsp;<em>Tafari</em> was the first name of the leader before he got the coronation as Emperor of Ethiopia (Tafari Makonnen).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\nAnother version&nbsp;says that&nbsp;when the emperor was forced into exile during an invasion, guerrilla warriors swore not to cut their hair until the emperor was reinstated.</p>\n<p><br>\nThe hairstyle stuck as a way or rebellion against the norm and to provoke the society.&nbsp;<em>I'm &nbsp;different and this is my nature.</em></p>\n<p><br>\nEven nowadays it's used to&nbsp;symbolize the beginning of a new cycle in life. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr. Ashe wrote in his book \"At first, the hair choices of the Rasta brethren were seen as frightening to children, destabilizing to society, and possibly even sacrilegious,\"&nbsp;As you can see Dreadlocks and Rastafari way of life found &nbsp;their path but were not born together.<br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>Some&nbsp;Rastas do not have Dreadlocks and many of those who have Dreadlocks aren't Rastas.&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<h2>Then, Bob Marley appeared in the 70's<br>\n</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/fgk0nveeh/Bobby.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"519\"/></p>\n<p>(credit: www.partymenu.eu)</p>\n<p>Bob Marley put together 3 symbols and showed them to the world: Reggae music, Jamaica and the Rasta culture.</p>\n<p>People did not understand much about that.&nbsp;But it wasn't relevant anymore because the rhythm of his songs and the lyrics were something impossible to miss out.</p>\n<p><br>\nBobby and his Dreads, Jamaica and Reggae music, Rastafari culture and Ganja became the new message going around&nbsp;the world \u2014 even if many people did not understand at all the relationship between those elements&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have to say that many of Bobby's messages didn't go far into the mind of those who were or&nbsp;perhaps are so into&nbsp;the hairstyle itself.&nbsp;But, this is another story which is outside of the scope of our conversation today.</p>\n<blockquote><br>\n....That until there no longer first class and second class citizens of any nation,<br>\nUntil the color of the man's skin is of no more significance&nbsp;of the color of his eyes, me say war<br>\n&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>From Jamaican&nbsp;Reggae to&nbsp;the Movies<br>\n</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/ocusrt50p/whoopi.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"698\"/></p>\n<p>(credit: spanish.fansshare.com/)</p>\n<blockquote>&nbsp;Normal is nothing more than a cycle on a washing machine</blockquote>\n<p>In the 80's a new face was wearing Dreadlocks.

She was just a woman who likes the hairstyle and decided to wear it and that become part of her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\nBy being a black woman from NY with a rising level of fame.&nbsp;Whoopi gave kind of cultural guidance or permission&nbsp;for African Americans to wear Dreads.... Then, more artists \u2014 and normal people too \u2014&nbsp;were open to wear the hairstyle without&nbsp;being&nbsp;connected to the Rasta culture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the past,&nbsp;and today as well, many people like Dreadlocks but prefer no to get it done to avoid the society implications of it.&nbsp;That's what I think.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dreadlocks nowadays...</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/6bbnu0azt/Dreads_extensions.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\"/>(credit: thebraidingdepot.com)</p>\n<p>In the last years,&nbsp;Dreadlocks became more about fashion and&nbsp;trend&nbsp;than Rasta culture or spirituality.</p>\n<p><br>\nMany athletes decided to have Dreads and as a result,&nbsp;fans and followers also enjoy to keep the trend and wear the hairstyle.</p>\n<p>It's interesting to note that even today, when Dreadlocks aren't actually something unusual or rare to find, some people&nbsp;still have reservations about those who wear it.</p>\n<blockquote>&nbsp;<br>\nWe humans are hard to accept that something or someone is different of what we used to know yesterday.</blockquote>\n<p><br>\nLooks like Dreadlocks, Reggae,&nbsp;Bob Marley and the Rasta culture will remain as one entity forever despite some other groups which are also known for wearing the hairstyle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\nAshe also wrote&nbsp;about it in his book&nbsp;<em>\"It\u2019s almost as if the cultural DNA of the hairstyle is Rasta, Jamaica, reggae music, and the farthest it gets from that source, it still retains some critical strands of that cultural DNA and it simply cannot be unwoven in a way that is interesting. And, I don\u2019t know if it will remain that way, but it sure seems like it. It\u2019s 2015, Bob Marley died in 1981, and the connection still seems to be there.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Different types of Dreadlocks....</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/4ksmsitgp/dreads_mens_hairstyles.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"672\"/></p>\n<p>(credit: hairdrome.com)</p>\n<p>Yes! There's different types of this hairstyle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some people just let the hair grow and get matted until it locks itself while some other use a crochet and&nbsp;twisting techniques to make the hair locks in a specific&nbsp;way \u2014 I'm a part of the second group \u2014</p>\n<p>But everything depends on the type of your hair,&nbsp;some types \u2014 mostly&nbsp;afro-descendants \u2014 will&nbsp;have more tendency&nbsp;to develop Dreadlocks with less effort. Other types of hair need hours of back combing technique to make the locks appear.</p>\n<p><br>\nAs you can see, Dreadlocks usually&nbsp;mean dedication and a lot of haircare for the person who decide to wear it. But, it&nbsp;probably&nbsp;will appear if you just stop washing&nbsp;and combing your hair for a while... just to let you know ;)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\nI am not a Rasta but&nbsp;I like their way of thinking. I like Dreads and that's why I started to develop them back in 2012 for the first time when I was living in the Caribbean.</p>\n<p><br>\nAfter 1 year I needed to go into the system again and work for a Telecom company in my country so I cut&nbsp;them out (It was hard, believe me). Then, in May&nbsp;2015,&nbsp;&nbsp;my life turned upside down&nbsp;so&nbsp;I decided to jump out of the system and let them grow again. This time I'm planning to have them for much&nbsp;longer period.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/xe4qrodk9/DSC_0488_2.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"588\"/></p>\n<p><br>\nWell, I hope you got better understanding about this hairstyle that isn't that&nbsp;dreading or fearing anymore but keep being called <strong>Dreadlocks</strong>.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading and don't forget to share the good vibes</p>\n<p>@handmade</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<h1>Social anxiety</h1> has only recently begun to enter our public consciousness. Although studies rank it as the third largest psychological disorder in the U.S. following depression and alcoholism, it still goes largely unrecognized by doctors, psychiatrists, social workers and therapists. That it is now emerging more in the sphere of public debate may be a cause for relief for those who have long struggled with this affliction in solitude. Social anxiety can build for such people a world filled with loneliness, financial struggle, insecurity and confusion.\n<center>http://www.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/5/c/t/p/k/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.620x349.17pltf.png/1445915769207.jpg</center>\n\nThe specific manifestations of this disorder will vary from person to person, but the underlying factor is a powerful fear of social situations. People with social anxiety will automatically judge themselves, analyzing their words, expressions and body language, and feel distinctly self-conscious and even inferior whenever they interact with others. This can create many negative repercussions. It can limit our friendships and make romantic fulfillment impossible. It can impact upon us financially if our anxiety makes it difficult to work in social environments and interact with co-workers and superiors. It can make our world very small. Indeed, under its influence we may only really feel comfortable when we\u2019re alone.\n\n<h1>People</h1> can be triggered by different situations. Some dread being the center of attention, while others try to avoid interacting with strangers or even passing them on the sidewalk. Some people can\u2019t help but feel that they\u2019re being watched. Others feel distinctly uneasy at times, believing that other people are secretly criticizing and teasing them \u2013 even if, on a rational level, they know that this really cannot be true. This kind of self-awareness distinguishes social anxiety disorder from paranoia and other kinds of delusions wherein sufferers fully believe in their distorted perceptions of reality.\n<center>http://www.ngabo.org/prophetic/yourbody/brain/images/paranoia.jpg</center>\nIt is this conflict between conscious thoughts and deeper beliefs and feelings that really drives social anxiety. Our desires for contact, for interaction and for intimacy are undercut by underlying convictions that we have about ourselves and the world at large. Recovering from social anxiety involves becoming aware of these deeper beliefs. Then we can examine them in the light of day and choose to discard them. If they remain unconscious, however, they will continue to generate unreasoning fear for us whenever we are obliged to function in any kind of a social environment.\n\n<h1>Such beliefs</h1> will vary widely from person to person. You might be deeply convinced of your own unworthiness. You might believe that human nature itself is highly suspect. You might be convinced that people in positions of authority will always abuse their power, and this will make your social anxiety especially acute whenever you have to interact with superiors at work. Understanding these underlying beliefs, and seeing how they influence the ways in which you think and feel, can rob your anxiety of its power. \n<center>http://media.vocativ.com/photos/2015/01/Chokehold-NYC-Poster2763883589.jpg</center>\n\nThis can be a difficult learning process to navigate alone. Fortunately, there are many forms of help available \u2013 and more continue to emerge as this disorder is acknowledged by science and medical practice. Some of the forms of therapy that can help you to grapple with the core beliefs that fuel your social anxiety include hypnotherapy, depth psychology, dream work and especially cognitive work that is aimed specifically at people who suffer from this disorder.\n     \n\n<hr><center>I bet you liked this post, if so please up-vote, follow, comment, share, or promote.</center><hr>\n<center><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@carlidos\"><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.imgsafe.org/9ce5f488b3.gif\"></a></center>",

Of course the idea is to win more money than the amount you lose, to achieve this you have to be psychologically strong, why? \u2013 Because you need to know when to close your positions, the moment you start saying *\u201cit will go back up, let\u2019s wait a bit more\u201d*, that\u2019s when you are screwed.\n\nBut the reason I stopped trading wasn\u00b4t because I was losing money. After a couple of months I learnt to be patient and control my urges to close wins early and prolong bad positions, I also learnt when the right moment to trade was and being such an avid reddit reader I knew how to sense hype and fear on the crypto-community, this helped me to anticipate pumps and dumps. \n\n### I bought Ether at $0.50 and sold at $6\n\n### I bought Litecoin at $1.80, sold at $5.50 during last year\u00b4s Chinese pump and then shorted it back to $3.50.\n\n![]( http://i.giphy.com/h0MTqLyvgG0Ss.gif)\n\nThe real reason why I quit trading was because it was destroying my social life and my marriage. Trading was stressing me like nothing before. I was constantly checking prices (every 5 minutes), price alarms where going off in the middle of the night, I was thinking about my positions when I was out on a family vacation or even when I was talking about something important with my wife. For me, it was really hard to trade big amounts and not be stressed about it.\n\n## Even when I won I was kicking myself for not investing more\u2026\n\nI am glad I don\u2019t day trade anymore, I can sell if the price is high and buy when its cheap but its not an everyday thing now. I am not constantly reading on cryptocurrency sub-reddits and rushing to polo or bittrex. I can honeslty say I feel a lot better.\n\nThe real lesson I learnt from trading was:\n\n# -DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY, NOT WHAT MAKES YOU MONEY\n\n#cryptocurrency\n#trading",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vwGv4tK.jpg?1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"/></p>\n<p>When my ex first kicked me out I wasn't prepared. Not that anyone ever is prepared for that. But I really wasn't anywhere close to being okay on my own. It was early November. Just 3 months prior to that my beautiful mother lost her battle with a brain tumor the size of a grapefruit. I was still paying off her funeral. &nbsp;I had nothing to my name. I knew no one in town that I really felt I trusted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My therapist told me a story a few weeks into seeing her. I'd been having a particularly awful time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Have you heart of Hemingway's lost suitcase?\"</p>\n<p>\"Like....the writer Ernest Hemingway?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>It goes like this....A young Ernest Hemingway was on correspondence assignment for the Toronto Daily Star in Switzerland. A prominent journalist and editor asked to see more of his work because he was really impressed with it. However, his writings were all back home with his wife Hadley in Paris. Hemingway asked her to bring them and bring them she did! She combed through their home and put all the manuscripts and papers she could find into a green suitcase. She even packed the carbon copies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After everything was packed Hadley made her way to a train at Gare de Lyon. She put the suitcase down and then went to get a bottle of water. She came back a few minutes later and the suitcase was gone! Years of his work gone, just like that. Hemingway was absolutely devastated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a letter to Ezra Pound he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><em>\u201cI suppose you heard about the loss of my Juvenalia? I went up to Paris last week to see what was left and found that Hadley had made the job complete by including all carbons, duplicates, etc. All that remains of my complete works are three pencil drafts of a bum poem which was later scrapped, some correspondence between John McClure and me, and some journalistic carbons. You, naturally, would say, \u2018Good\u2019 etc. But don't say it to me. I ain't yet reached that mood.I worked 3 years on the damn stuff. Some like that Paris 1922 I fancied.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p>However, within 4 years, Hemingway was one of the most important figures in American literature. It was also after his loss of everything, and being forced to start bare bones that he wrote \"The Sun Also Rises,\" which is widely considered his best work. &nbsp;Hemingway used this opportunity to grow and really find the voice that defined him and made him stand out from the rest. Perhaps if he hadn't felt that loss and that pain he might not have found his voice.</p>\n<p>One of the things that I love the most about humanity is how resilient we are. Our ability to evolve is and adapt is fascinating. We grow wiser, we grow stronger, and we become better people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I had nothing I was close to giving up. But that same resilience that helped Hemingway overcome losing everything helped me too. The human spirit, if you will. &nbsp;I had no choice but to evolve and overcome. Sink or swim. I was not about to sink. I was not about to drown. I became stronger and I found my path on my own. I built my own life from ashes and I rose above it all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now I write this from my very own apartment. A humble, little place, but my own nonetheless (and it has a parking spot! In LA!) Tomorrow I get to wake up and go to work at a job that I love. &nbsp;No matter what you're going through, remember YOU TOO are resilient.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You too will find a happy/memorable moment in your life comparable to writing a Nobel Prize Winning novel like Hemingway did with \"The Old Man And the Sea.\" It might come in the form of getting the keys to your own apartment, or getting that dream job, or meeting a special person. But it will come and you will be happy you didn't give up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And from <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em>, &nbsp;remember....\u201cA man can be destroyed but not defeated\u201d.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

Music streaming has hit it's stride. Audible has made listening to audiobooks easy. And podcasts have finally earned the respect they deserve.</h1>\n<p>I've been a die hard Podcast listener for years now, but until recently, it was something I didn't really talk about. Most of my friends had never even heard of podcasts.</p>\n<p>But lately, podcasts have exploded in popularity and for a good reason: the people behind the shows have complete creative control. There is no studio or producer giving notes, shaping the material into something other than what it's supposed to be.</p>\n<p>It's pure artistic expression at it's finest and the exponentially growing number of listeners are a testament to it's power.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>If you are new to podcasts, you are in for a treat, otherwise, I hope you enjoy this list of some of my all time favorite podcasts:</h2>\n<h1><a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/\"><strong>Radiolab:</strong></a></h1>\n<p>According to the folks at Radiolab, \u201cRadiolab is a show about curiosity. Where sound illuminates ideas, and the boundaries blur between science, philosophy, and human experience.\u201d</p>\n<p>But it's so much more than that. The shows founder, Jad Abumrad, received a McArthur Genius grant to continue producing the show, and together with his cohost Robert Krulwich, they make radio magic. Just jump in anywhere, the episodes are so consistently great that you really can't go wrong.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmeDBp6HCEACLC8hoKtPmpczWVsRjdPz9pVULBnBDAnYuY\" width=\"680\" height=\"253\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wesa.fm/programs/radiolab#stream/0\"><em>(Image Source: WESA)</em></a></p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia\">Invisibilia:</a></h1>\n<p>Invisibilia, in their own words, is a show, \"about the invisible forces that control human behavior \u2013 ideas, beliefs, assumptions and emotions.\" It combines the best storytelling elements of shows like This American Life and Radio lab with deep scientific research and journalism to create a one-of-a-kind experience. Just about every single episode will blow your mind, but I recommend starting with \"How to Become Batman\" from season 1. Invisibilia has become, hands down, my favorite podcast.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmXQXKstj7iThvPQJWqkGgzAXcgPm8irmaZWY4F1nGSeQH\" width=\"1000\" height=\"537\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wrvo.org/programs/invisibilia#stream/0\"><em>(Image Source: WRVO.org)</em></a></p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/\">This American Life:</a></h1>\n<p>By far the most popular podcast in the US. Hosted by Ira Glass, TAL is a highly produced series of radio documentaries. Each week they choose a theme and showcase a series of stories that exemplify the theme. I've been a fan for a long time, it's some of the best storytelling you could ever hope to hear.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmPb5M9JqeT46AnJg6o7KenfQYNiLuJkT2mPs8vhAXcttA\" width=\"1000\" height=\"514\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/tv/show/This_American_Life?id=J4nvfK3-vmA\"><em>(Image Source: Google Play)</em></a></p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/\">The Tim Ferriss Show:</a></h1>\n<p>One of my all time favorites. It's a long form interview show where best-selling author and human guinea pig Tim Ferriss deconstructs excellence with top-performers from around the world to extract the tools, techniques, and routines they use to be so successful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmdakmKVKQ1gJYHPG1kbaHMAWG6xrvvGN4phrxcHQRrzRh\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?mt=2\"><em>(Image Source: Itunes)</em></a></p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://podcasts.joerogan.net/\">The Joe Rogan Experience:</a></h1>\n<p>This is the show that got me into podcasts in the first place and it holds a special place in my heart. Comedian Joe Rogan (yes the fear factor guy / UFC commentator) interviews fascinating guests from all walks of life and they go deep. The show regularly lasts for 3 hours which seems like it would be hard to get through but its not. I can't recommend Joe's podcast enough.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmRGYKXVfinTxgRCqn9fDWAzRedFMz7tLg2PgXm1RNr6BG\" width=\"851\" height=\"315\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.whoismcafee.com/live-with-joe-rogan-on-the-joe-rogan-experience/\"><em>(Image Source: Whoismcafee)</em></a></p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://chrisryanphd.com/tangentially-speaking/\">Tangentially Speaking with Dr. Chris Ryan:</a></h1>\n<p>Tangentially Speaking is an interview show hosted by one incredible guy. Chis Ryan is a world traveler, deep thinker, and the best-selling author of <em>Sex at Dawn. </em>It's an interview style show that explores the deeper side of life, like why were here and what were meant to be doing. Chris is an authentic, charming, and incredibly knowledgable host. You'll definitely want to check this one out!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmYrq1irDDL9CCcUuW15HcQmv6mxjwZaVMyaYHd3EKVUHh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"532\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://whyproject.co.uk/tangentially-speaking-dr-christopher-ryan/\"><em>(Image Source: Whyproject)</em></a></p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://serialpodcast.org\">Serial:</a></h1>\n<p>Hosted by this American Life Producer Sarah Koenig, \u201c<em>Serial</em>&nbsp;tells one story\u2014a true story\u2014over the course of a&nbsp;season.\u201d It's a fantastic show and season one was the first insanely successful breakout podcast of all time. It brought a lot of new listeners to the podcast world. Season 1 detailed the story of Adnan Sayed, a high school student who was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his classmate Hae Min Lee. But Adnan has always maintained his innocence and the case was largely based on the testimony of one witness. I can't recommend it enough.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmYB21LvpTY6GRhh8ySMwqTKbMBmb3kEhhrWyrGbgtUEEY\" width=\"950\" height=\"331\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.playbuzz.com/liranadani10/are-you-a-true-serial-podcast-expert\"><em>(Image Source:&nbsp;Playbuzz)</em></a></p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://revisionisthistory.com/\">Revisionist History:</a></h1>\n<p>Legendary best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell is the creator and host of this wonderful podcast, new for 2016. It's documentary style storytelling, part investigational journalism, and it's awesome. Each week Gladwell, reexamines something from the past, either an event, a person, or an idea. It's highly produced and a great listen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmeTVYgQsaUyykWFzaVLFKNQPNeXfvW1vAwCWSEwy532a4\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\"/></p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/podcasts/481105292/more-perfect\">More Perfect:</a></h1>\n<p>The brainchild of Radiolab host Jad Abumrad, More Perfect examines the human stories behind some of the most important Supreme Court cases in US history. It has all the elements that made Radiolab a success and is fascinating to listen to. They knocked it out of the park with this one!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media2.wnyc.org/i/raw/1/MorePerfect_RightRailButton.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/\"><em>(Image Source: Radiolab)</em></a></p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/\">Reply All:</a></h1>\n<p>Reply All is hard to pin down but at it's core, it's a storytelling show about the weird world of the internet. It's produced by Gimlet Media, a company full of This American Life veterans, and hosted by Alex Goldman and PJ Vogt, two quirky, intelligent, geeky guys. This show has a lot going for it and has become one of my favorites!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmPQsTfTvqhMudgwodSHmFfUSTSeTLfdbrVMSPWF9uXqAK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"258\"/></p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://www.jamesaltucher.com/category/the-james-altucher-show/\">The James Altucher Show:</a></h1>\n<p>I've learned more from James than I have from most people that I've actually met in real life. The James Altucher Show is a long form interview show hosted by best-selling author, entrepreneur, and all around creative genius James Altucher. It has somewhat of a business bent, but James interviews successful people from all walks of life and there is always powerful lessons to learn. I highly recommend this one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmS8p1vCXVAgb3H3A2mjqff1DCs1ooeFFhF3gLWG1QPuQg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"/></p>\n<p>Got a great podcast recommendation?

    "body": "<html>\n<center><p>http://i.imgur.com/sLrlLdB.jpg?1</p></center>\n<h1><p><strong>Forms of Recovery</strong></p></h1>\n<p>There are various forms of recovery, and many of us know recovering alcoholics and/or drug addicts and are aware of the battles that they wage. In a more general sense, our spiritual recovery \u2013 collectively speaking \u2013 involves awakening from some of the damaging myths that Western culture has lived its life by. We have to shed the notion that life and consciousness were accidents, for one thing. None of us have completely escaped the influence of this belief (it is too pervasive), and it encourages us to see all of our struggles \u2013 and our very human nature \u2013 as essentially meaningless.</p>\n<p><em>Ultimately, we\u2019re never going to find true fulfillment if we accept an idea such as this. A sense of purpose is essential to our psychological and even physical well-being. And our inner being will never accept such narrow definitions of our humanity anyway. If we choose to believe that we lead insignificant lives then we\u2019ll just end up using our thoughts and words to try and deny what we know in our hearts.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<h1><p><strong>Bad Dream</strong></p></h1>\n<p>The myth of a meaningless universe is like a bad dream that we collectively need to awaken from if we are to begin living in a saner manner on this planet. The concept has caused a lot of suffering en masse. It may have represented a well-meant attempt to make sense of the physical world and create \u201corder out of chaos\u201d at one point in time, but the consequences of accepting it as a truism can no longer be denied.</p>\n<p>Its impact upon the natural world is obvious. When we view Mother Nature as an accidental by-product devoid of significance then we do not feel inspired to act as caretakers of our planet. In fact, the idea of a sterile universe \u2013 especially when coupled with Darwinian concepts of evolution \u2013 encourages us to see nature as an adversary to be conquered. We think that we\u2019re separate from nature and so nature becomes an entity to be controlled and manipulated. Only in recent decades have greater numbers of people come to perceive that we\u2019ll inevitably end up destroying ourselves if we persist in taking such a stance.</p>\n<center><p>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/18/ea/76/18ea76ca236de499cbaf233f1ba7d405.jpg</p></center>\n<h1><p><strong>New Convictions</strong></p></h1>\n<p>Sweeping changes in the world require that new convictions take root within us. Many of us don\u2019t feel motivated to change our courses unless we\u2019re in pain or otherwise profoundly dissatisfied with our lives. Sometimes people find the impetus to examine their core beliefs after a dramatic event such as an accident, a bout of severe illness or a near-death experience. The earth crisis provides that motivation across the board in the modern day. Because it is a collective problem, it demands a reexamination of collective beliefs. We must awaken from the idea that our universe is a meaningless accident if we are to move forward.</p>\n<p><em>To win the fight for the natural world and for our own continued survival we need to begin believing in our own inherent worth again. This in itself will open up avenues of healing \u2013 and present solutions to global problems \u2013 that escape us at the moment.</em></p>\n<p>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ph0e7H61EcY/maxresdefault.jpg</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "There may have been moments in your life when you have had given up all hope, moments in which life, and the whole universe may have felt meaningless. Moments in which you may have lost your confidence in life, in humanity, and had thought that your will to live was shredded to pieces. We have all had moments like these, moments in which we had become devoid of hope.\n\nhttp://www.mortalflesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/feb25_life-01.jpg\n[Image credit](http://www.mortalflesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/feb25_life-01.jpg)\n\nSometimes, it is indeed possible that you may not be able to carry the mountains of responsibility and pressure that are laden on you. The mental and psychological weight crushes your shoulders. You fall down and instead of getting up, you start thinking about not getting up. Not being able to fulfill the expectations of others and failing to succeed are the catalysts that start the psychological downward spiral of an individual. He searches far and wide to find even a glimmer of hope that would convince him to stay strong, that would say to him, \"There is indeed goodness in the world. Don't give up for life is worth living.\"\n\nhttp://media.salemwebnetwork.com/cms/CW/family/13412-new-life-plant-grow-green-hope-wide.1200w.tn.jpg\n[Image credit](http://media.salemwebnetwork.com/cms/CW/family/13412-new-life-plant-grow-green-hope-wide.1200w.tn.jpg)\n\n#### The flame of life needs something that ignites it and keeps it aflame. If that fundamental requirement goes unfulfilled, then that individual is sure to suffer. Motivation is required. Something so that the person wakes up every morning with a purpose, he knows it in his heart that when he wakes up tomorrow, he shall not be wasting another day in petty pursuits. This is what ensures that there is still the flame of hope burning in the heart of that person.\n\nhttp://pre02.deviantart.net/8f25/th/pre/i/2012/166/0/2/___flame_of_life____by_sinistereternity-d53kq7k.png\n[Image credit](http://pre02.deviantart.net/8f25/th/pre/i/2012/166/0/2/___flame_of_life____by_sinistereternity-d53kq7k.png)\n\nOften times, that flame is put out under the heavy boots of pressure and responsibility which prompts that person to lose all the shreds of hope and confidence that he has left. This gives him the minute push he needed to be thrown off the cliff. A void is formed in the heart and mind of such a person. He seeks ways through which he can escape reality. Drugs are the usual suspects here. But sometimes, this reaches to such a point of extremity that that individual thinks that the only way out is suicide.\n\nI know people that are the big judgemental types. I mean, we are all judgemental of others from time to time even if we try not to be, but there are some people whom we all may know that have crossed that thin line. I know people that judge others for suicide, with comments such as, \"He was a coward.\" They don't even try to understand the pain that person must have been going through that he decided to commit suicide. It must be something pretty heavy of course.\n\n## I was reading Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace the other day and I read one of the most powerful descriptions of the mind of someone who commits suicide.\n\n> he so-called \u2018psychotically depressed\u2019 person who tries to kill herself doesn\u2019t do so out of quote \u2018hopelessness\u2019 or any abstract conviction that life\u2019s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump. Not really. You\u2019d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling\n\n*So why shouldn't you give up on life?*\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/anLa_YZK29Y/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nTrying again is important. You are bound to taste the sweetness of success if you try continuously hard enough. Failure is nothing to be ashamed of. If nothing else, it brings a lesson with itself that ultimately contributes to your betterment as a whole. Make efforts to fix something you are not content with, fix it. Eventually, there **will** come a time when you will succeed and happiness will surround you.\n\nhttp://i1312.photobucket.com/albums/t535/michelle_liew2/try%20again_zpsfgypgac9.png\n\nRef:https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/4339.David_Foster_Wallace\n\n***@dragonslayer109 features authors to promote new authors and a diversity of content.

I mean what do you really desire more than anything else in the world?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You might think that there are a lot of different answers to that question depending on who you ask and maybe there is to start with. But if you dig a bit deeper you will find out that there is a universal answer to that question. The answer is of course to be happy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Now how does it come that people having such a hard time being happy? Now you say that this question must have trillions of different answers depending on who you ask. I mean just look at the world! But what were you about to say if I say that you can narrow it down to one answer. No matter who you are, what you have been thru, what you are going thru, there's only one thing keeping you from being happy. Are you ready for the answer? Don't let the simplicity fool you. The answer is your ego.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>You'll see the ego is preventing you from living in the present moment. And it's virtually impossible to feel unhappy in the now. Quick example, if you're depressed, regretting or dwelling you're living in the past and if you're anxious, worried or afraid you're living in the future. And just to be clear, the only moment that exists is the now, you can't do something in the past or the future because when you do, it is now. Another example is when you telling you're self, I will be happy when I have this or that, or I will be happy when I have achieved this or that. It doesn't work like that, to be happy when you have this or that requires that you are happy now. You simply can't push your happiness to the future. And to be brutally honest it's actually a choice whether to be happy or not. You can name any bad side of an emotion like anger, hope, frustration, guilt and so on. And it's all caused by your ego. It's the little voice in your head telling you, you're not good enough, you can't do that, you're ugly and so on. Do you get it? It is fucked, because the ego can only work with your previous experiences and it's only job is to keep you safe and holding you back from progressing. That's why you get a clash between the ego and you're true self that wants to do new stuff and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Now you might be wondering, how the hell can I shut this ego up. There are ways and I will probably write about a few later on, but for me has the book Creating A Bug Free Mind by Andy Shaw been a true game changer and if I could I would recommend it to everyone. But that's not why I'm writing here today.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>It's actually so that I got to experience something wonderful recently. Something so powerfully beautiful that not a single drug in the world could compare to. \"Except maybe dmt, haven't tried that yet\" But this lasted for a much longer time and it's still there, so it should beat dmt as well. Most of you have already guessed what it is. It is love of course. I got to meet the love of my life, my twin spirit. Connection on every single level, heart, mind, body and soul. And especially to begin with it made time stand still, it made every single problem go away, it made everything very simple, it made me see everything from a new perspective, it made me to be only in the now and it made me happier than I ever have been before. So what really struck me was that love must be the meaning of life, because it kills the ego and you're finally your true higher self that you are supposed to be.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Much love to you all!<br>\n/Emanuel Lindqvist</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "http://teamperformance.co.nz/images/chemo_drugs.jpg\n\nPlease accept my apologies for the delay in writing this post. Time in hospital, then recovery had put my schedules back somewhat. So back to it, and away once again.\n\nAs mentioned in my earlier post, when I was first diagnosed with lung cancer the doctor explained my tumours were advanced, and should chemotherapy treatment not be scheduled for the immediate future he believed the cancer would kill me within two, possible three months at the most. \n\nSome people support Chemo, some don\u2019t. I had absolutely no idea which was the right choice or wrong one to make. With the doctor suggesting I had limited time left I went with what he had advised in an attempt to buy more time. \n\nI guess one of the other reasons I chose chemo was my health was deteriorating rapidly by this stage. I was beginning to realize I was in a pretty bad way. I was unable to walk from my lounge to the bathroom and back without gasping for breath. It was so difficult to breath it had become a frightening experience. Learning not to panic, and to concentrate on regaining my breath seemed to take forever before I finally, to some degree, regained control of my breathing again. Fear really does become a reality when you wonder where your next breath is going to come from.\n\nTrying to sleep was also a terrible experience. I was unable to lay down and sleep, I had to get whatever sleep I could by sitting upright in a lounge chair. Sitting upright made breathing easier. \n      \nNevertheless, time arrived for me to have my first scheduled chemotherapy treatment. I was a little apprehensive to say the least. I had heard some people go through chemo without any problems at all, but others, a different story. I had been informed side effects like nausea and vomiting were common, tiredness, mouth sores, muscle pain, sleeplessness, hair loss, and more seriously, damage to the immune system left you exposed to greater risk of infection. But here I am, sitting in a lounge chair, in the cancer ward, waiting for my first chemo to be administered. \n\nhttp://teamperformance.co.nz/images/chemo_treatment%202.jpg\n\nA few moments later my nurse arrives and gives me a quick examination. She checks my weight, blood pressure, pulse, breathing and temperature. No problems with the short medical so now the IV line goes into my arm, a tube is hooked up, and the pump is started. I see the fluid begin to flow down the tube and think, for better or for worse, here we go!\n\nThe chemo treatment lasted for two and a half hours. Once finished my nurse took out the IV, I was finished and on my way home. \n\nThe following six days was great. No side effects from the chemo what-so-ever. I thought I had got through the whole ordeal just fine \u2026 and then it began to happened!\n\nI was beginning to feel a tightness in my chest, and was constantly coughing. I felt unwell in general, and started to run a fever. I had been warned by my chemo nurse, should I begin to feel unwell in any way I was to contact the hospital immediately due to the greater risk of infection while on chemotherapy.\n\nI arrive at the Hospitals Accident and Emergency Department, I explain I have cancer and currently receiving chemotherapy and they admit me immediately. (It seemed unusual to walk into the A & E, see countless people waiting to be seen, yet be taken immediately. I guess when a person has no basic immune system they are not going to leave you sitting in a room with a whole lot of people with various sicknesses). On examination they found a chest infection had developed. They began administering antibiotics intravenously but by the following morning I was so unwell I wasn\u2019t able to leave my bed. The doctor wanted me to try and cough to help break up the phlegm on my chest, but the pain when attempting to cough was just too great, I was unable to. So they increased the morphine, to kill the pain, to encouraged me to cough. \n\nMy breathing at this stage was worse than ever.  I was on and off a machine to help with my breathing, although it didn\u2019t seem to improve my condition all that much. There was some comfort being in hospital, at least I knew there were people there to help me if things got really out of control. \n\nAlthough this confidence did diminish a little when an Oncology doctor arrived at my bedside to speak with me. He wanted to discuss how long I wanted them to continue to try and save my life once they had considered the battle was gone and lost. He went on to say at the end, once they had tubes down my throat in an attempt to keep me alive, and ultimately jumping on my chest to keep me breathing any hope of quality of life will have now ended. At what stage did I want them to basically leave me alone, and walk away? \n\nThinking about this for a few moments I came to the realization that I wouldn\u2019t want my final days simply living as a vegetable. No fun in that! And how bad would it be for my wife and family to visit and continually witness me in this condition? It simply wouldn\u2019t be fair on them either. When that moment ultimately arrives it would be far healthier that we all let go, accept the final reality of my condition, and for those I love to get back on with life as soon as humanly possible.\n\nMy decision: When the time arrives no tubes, no life support, let me leave as naturally as possible for the sake of all!         \n\nBut I certainly aren\u2019t there yet!\n \nAfter five days in hospital the infection began to improve. I was beginning to feel better and breathing was on the improve. I was beginning to think that it would be no time at all and I would be back home again. \n\nBut it was not to be. All of a sudden, out of the blue my mouth begins to water. That awful queasy watery feeling you get just before being sick. I knew what was about to happen, and thankfully was able to get a bowl just in time. The following days were absolute hell. I just kept on being sick. I didn\u2019t think anyone could ever be so sick, so many times, and live to tell the story. And when I didn\u2019t actually vomit I dry- reached! I couldn\u2019t eat, even the faintest smell of food the vomiting would start. Nausea and vomiting. It just wouldn\u2019t stop. The hospital staff were trying different drugs in an attempt to control it, but it just carried on, and on, and on. Thankfully, a young doctor finally came up with the right drug which was able to contain it. The crazy thing is once this particular drug was administered, the nausea and vomiting stopped nearly as quickly as it started. Honestly, nausea and vomiting for continuous days is absolutely horrific, I hope I never have to experience it again.\n\nStill, my problems hadn\u2019t finished yet. After continuous nausea and vomiting for three days I woke the following morning to a realization of: \n\n\u201cI certainly \u2018wasn\u2019t\u2019 hooked up to a urine-bag when I went to sleep last night. What\u2019s happening?\u201d \n\nIt seemed like only seconds after waking a nurse was at my bedside taking my blood-pressure, pulse and temperature. I asked her, \u201cwhat has happened to me? I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t hooked up to a urine-bag when I went to sleep last evening\u201d. She said that I wasn\u2019t, and the bag was there so there was no need for me to get out of bed any time soon. Apparently during the course of the night I must have got up to go to the toilet. I wasn\u2019t in my bed when the night nurse came to check on me so she begun to look to see where I was. She found me a little way from my bed, lying on the floor completely out cold and lifeless. They had begun running tests as they were not sure whether I had slipped and fallen, had I passed out before dropping to the floor, or for how long I had been unconscious. \n\nSoon after a doctor come to speak with me as the nursing staff had reported I had appeared to be experiencing some form of confusion since the fall. The doctor said the small cell cancer which I have is extremely aggressive and can spread to other parts of the body quickly. He was concerned it may have spread to the brain. He wanted an immediate CT Scan to see if there was any evidence of cancer in the brain, also if I had done damage to the head area as a consequence of the fall. \n\nSome good news at last. The CT Scan came back clear! No cancer in the brain, or evidence of damage caused to the head region from the fall. \n\nApart from my own doctor calling in on me once a day, I had a variety of student doctors speak with me at least four times a day. Each time asking questions like \u2026 what day was it \u2013 what hospital ward was I in - what year was it \u2013 what year was I born - when did the second world war end? I did realize there must have been some form of problem as I apparently had a difficulty remembering which year it was \u2026 I was sure it was either 2014 or 2015, obviously later to find we are definitely in 2016  :) :)\n\nOn the second day, not only was I being asked the \u201cwhat year is it?\u201d questions, I was also being repeatedly asked what my pain levels were like? Was I experiencing any increased pain, how would I score my pain from 0 \u2013 10? \n\nLong story short.  What I had explained to me later was they were steadily decreasing the medications I was taking. From the time of my initial admittance I was given a quantity of various medications, pills for this and pills for that, I had drips going into both arms at one time, morphine and trial morphine patch, different drugs to stop the nausea and vomiting and so it goes on.  As the effect of the medications slowly left my body \u2013 my memory increasingly returned.  \n\nFinally, my doctor was able to put the initial loss of consciousness, then confusion down to the amount of medication I had taken over the previous 11 days.\n\nFinally, the day arrived when one of the trainee doctors stuck his head around the curtain and said with a huge smile, \u201cyour tests are finally all clear, here\u2019s a list of the things you are still not allowed to do, but these are not going to stop you going home\u201d. I am just going to write you a prescription for some medications you will need, complete your discharge papers, and you are out of here!\u201d You can ring someone to come and pick you up. Awesome!!\n\nAfter being in hospital and unable to eat or leave my bed for so long did have its consequences. By the time I got home I had lost a considerable amount of weight, I still felt very weak and tired, but you know what: I AM HOME AND I AM HAPPY!\n\nAnd you know what just arrived in the mail on my 3rd day home \u2026 my next appointment for my 2nd Treatment of Chemotherapy :) :)\n\nMore to come soon, have a happy day. \nRegards, Gary   @garywilson \n\nBy sharing my experiences my hope is I can help and encourage other sufferers to remain positive and fight the battle, also provide important information to family members and friends who support those they love as they journey through this terrible disease.   \n \nShould you like this post and feel the information is of value to yourself and others, please remember to VOTE, SHARE, and FOLLOW",

But, so many of us still think that it's&nbsp;just a scientific&nbsp;stuff or a trending New Era Culture.</p>\n<p>We (humans) have in front of our eyes the best and more organized system where the efficiency levels are&nbsp;100% proven.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This system is the&nbsp;Nature, La Naturaleza,&nbsp;Narava, A Natureza....</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/rrmmisw4p/nexttotheriver.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bjstlh.com/\">image credit</a></p>\n<h2>Closer to the future, further from the roots</h2>\n<p>Everyday a new invention, everyday new knowledge is uncovered..... So many patents for so&nbsp;many ideas to improve our life and make our bodies last longer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But we're disconnected from our roots, from all these generations where the life expectancy was 20 or more years longer than it's&nbsp;today. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy with all this development that allows me to have this conversation with you.&nbsp;I'm seeing the price we're paying for this development and it's going up and up.</p>\n<p>The Nature, that source where so much knowledge has been receiving for generations is&nbsp;now&nbsp;getting to the breaking point or I better say it's far beyond that point.</p>\n<p>That system with 100% proven efficiency is now broken in many levels because&nbsp;of human intervention. But the most crazy part of the story is that we (humans) pretend to blame&nbsp;Nature for the unbalance of the system.</p>\n<p>We cut&nbsp;hundreds of trees in the name of development, then ask out loud&nbsp;<em>Why is taking Nature so long to recover that place?</em></p>\n<p>We modify the coastline to open a new resorts and tourism attractions. Then, the question is <em>Why sea water is flooding&nbsp;new place? (more than ever before)</em></p>\n<p>Nature knows how to regenerate and keep the life flowing, with no effort and actually with no residues. Everything in perfect balance. That perfect balance become invisible when your eyes and feelings are deep into&nbsp;this&nbsp;technological world with a different sense of time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/eq0xsy7qh/Deforestation.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"littleusgoneglobal.wordpress.com\">image credit</a></p>\n<h2>Cycles are&nbsp;everything in life, some are short and others are very long</h2>\n<p>I like to observe the cycles in the nature because I believe there's the path to live a meaningful life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A caterpillar have to be strong enough to become a butterfly...&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the baby buffalo doesn't get strong fast enough, he's more likely to be killed by lions...</p>\n<p>Every year a vast portion of South African woodlands are burned&nbsp;just to be ready for new ways of life next season. Actually woodlands&nbsp;need to burn in order to maintain their ecological integrity. These ecosystem are&nbsp;<strong>Fire-adapted.</strong></p>\n<p>From our point of view some of this cycles in nature are apparently incomplete or too slow. So, we (humans) want to speed it up to please&nbsp;our desires \u2014 greedy and superfluous most of the time \u2014&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What if we reconnect&nbsp;with the big source?</h2>\n<p>Why if you, I and the rest of the human kind go back to nature?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ancient civilizations got vast knowledge and develop this deep connection with the nature.&nbsp;Connection witch had&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;beneficial support to their&nbsp;life. It wasn't about breaking the system's chain to see how they&nbsp;can fit in.&nbsp;It was more about exploring&nbsp;the similarities they&nbsp;shared through&nbsp;observation and get the knowledge within it.</p>\n<p>Egyptians proved to had very good understandings about topics such as art, architecture&nbsp;and&nbsp;geometry&nbsp;\u2014 they are often called The first Geometry Experts \u2014</p>\n<p>Incas had at&nbsp;Machu Picchu a big example of a&nbsp;<strong>notable hydraulic master piece</strong> according to Hydraulic engineer Kenneth R. Wright</p>\n<blockquote>The channel that brings water to Machu Picchu is 750 meters long, 12 centimeters deep and 15 centimeters wide. For every 100 meters of distance traveled, it descends 10 meters, so that gravity could maintain a flow of 300 liters per minute.</blockquote>\n<p>This is even more advanced than what we can build&nbsp;today.</p>\n<p>I know there is some other hypothesis about how they manage to built it&nbsp;or from where they got the knowledge to do it.&nbsp;This is more deeper topic and I don't wanna get to far from the&nbsp;main idea.</p>\n<p>Someone can tell me \"Ok, but if these civilizations were so developed why they disappeared?\" On that matter I can say: The end of these advanced civilizations didn't happen because they had&nbsp;lack of knowledge or failure to interact with nature. It happened because of something bigger and harder to defeat: Human greed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/oolwffh61/Machu_Picchu_water.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rogerdhansen.wordpress.com\">image credit &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>It's possible to get a good balance?</h2>\n<p>I believe so!</p>\n<p>Well!...to be honest the history had&nbsp;shown that&nbsp;the development process for human kind wasn't&nbsp;balanced indeed.&nbsp;But, this is the reason why I strongly believe that it's possible.</p>\n<p>Today, we have all this knowledge and proof of all the work done before from all these brilliant minds in different fields.

All we need to do is: follow <a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@sauravrungta/peace-of-mind-the-ultimate-achievement\">the phases&nbsp;of the cycle</a> in every step of our life. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The unbreakable law&nbsp;of&nbsp;the any ecosystem</h2>\n<p>For any element&nbsp;of this&nbsp;ecosystem the first rule is to realize and understand where&nbsp;is its&nbsp;current place on the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>If you do not know Who you are... Where are you coming from... It's virtually impossible that you can interact in any cycle without producing a unbalance effect.</p>\n<p><em>Wait a minute!</em> I'm not saying that you need to accept your current&nbsp;condition and give up any effort to move up&nbsp;in this ecosystem. I'm saying that before you put any effort, make sure you&nbsp;know in witch direction to go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/gzp23pgo9/who_am_i.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"713\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://karengately.wordpress.com\">image credit</a></p>\n<h2>Taking time to see,&nbsp;taking time to&nbsp;listen...</h2>\n<p>As I said before&nbsp;Nature has been the source of knowledge for ancient civilizations&nbsp;and nowadays is still the best way to get deeply connected with the inner world inside our minds.</p>\n<p>I like to spend time in&nbsp;the nature and just try to get into the flow that maintain the pulse of the life effortless,&nbsp;in perfect balance. Even if I&nbsp;don't practice any meditation technique in this moment,&nbsp;I'm using my senses to feel&nbsp;how life is happening everywhere. I Allow myself to be aware that I'm a part of this current of life fulfilling the space.</p>\n<p>It's much more than a trendy way of thinking. It's about balancing our life in a molecular level and explore&nbsp;our maximum potential in whatever field we decide to develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's about recognizing&nbsp;that we're a part of this big ecosystem and we make impact with every move. Therefore, you and I are directly responsible for the results that we receive every day.</p>\n<p>When you feel stuck, stressed&nbsp;or with lack of ideas, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/travel/@handmade/this-is-slovenia-let-s-escape-to-the-savinja-alps-and-enjoy-in-rinka-waterfall-bonus-chapter\">surround yourself with nature.</a> Let the energy of life flow through your senses... Soon enough you'll feel the difference within the rest of your everyday&nbsp;activities, within your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/tbryh74ix/DSC_0689.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading...</p>\n<p>@handmade</p>\n<p>Spreading the Good Vibes...<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>I decided to conduct experiment, if a simple guy, like me, can create a fully valid source of income from writing articles on Steemit? For this purpose I will be writing at least 1 post every day for 30 days.</p>\n<p>I have always wanted much from life and dreamed about participating in big projects. In 2008 I lost everything, I lost my business and broke up with the girl I wanted to have a family with. Just in a blink of an eye I lost everything that I believed in, everything that I made plans for, it was as if someone took away the ground I stood on.</p>\n<center><p>http://www.deepeemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2-stalker-eye.jpg<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.deepeemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2-stalker-eye.jpg\">Image credit</a></p></center>\n<p>Since then I've been living in startup mode for 8 years, creating the life of my dreams. When I say in startup mode, it means nobody pays you a salary twice a month, and every month you just don't know whether you will make some money tomorrow or not, whether you will be able to pay for the rent. Morally it's not easy to live in such a mode.</p>\n<p>I had hundreds of goals and undertakings. During this time I gave up drinking and smoking, read a vast number of business books and books about personal growth, completed different trainings. But I still have a feeling that I am not moving on and nothing is changing.</p>\n<p>If I look back and honestly analyze my results, I can say that I haven't done enough by now. Yes, I grew up a lot as a person, got great experience and internal force, but I am still far away from my dream as I was 8 years ago.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I feel like I don't have enough strength to carry on and I think maybe it's time to give up, but every time I feel up to move on. Only my faith supports me and gives me power to continue. Perhaps, Steemit will become for me the base and let me rest for a while. When I look at most of the people I was growing up with, the most terrifying thing that comes to my mind is that I will lose my faith and give up, reject my dream and accept my life as it is.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<center><h1><em>\u201cHow long is forever?\u201d \u2013 Alice<br>\n\u201cSometimes, just one second.\u201d \u2013 White Rabbit</em></h1></center>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I see Steemit as a platform where people can do cool stuff and amazing projects, unlock their creativity. It looks like a very attractive dream and maybe I just live in a fool's paradise?</p>\n<center><p>http://m.cdn.blog.hu/bu/businessandcafe/image/Post%20uploads/kepek/entrepreneurial-kid.jpg<br>\n<a href=\"http://m.cdn.blog.hu/bu/businessandcafe/image/Post%20uploads/kepek/entrepreneurial-kid.jpg\">Image credit</a></p></center>\n<p>I have already managed to make some money with two guides for the beginners (<a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemhelp/@lehard/beginner-s-guide-steemian-s-adventures-in-wonderland-part-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemhelp/@lehard/beginner-s-guide-part-2-steemit-how-the-hell-does-it-work\">2</a>). Now I have 30 days to check if it happened accidentally or I can do it again. If I can make Steemit my source of income fully covering my expenses and, maybe, it will be enough to even make my dream come true.</p>\n<p>My plan minimum is $1 000 for a living, plan maximum is $ 15 000, it will help me and my friends to achieve our big ambition. I will tell you about it in my next posts.</p>\n<p>I am a simple guy, I even don't speak English (this post, as most of the others, was translated by a translator). &nbsp;And if I do it, it means anybody can do it. I was never into cryptocurrencies, I don't have friends among whales, I am not a popular crypto-anarchist and certainly not a playmate))). I just want to do cool things valuable for the people and the platform. It'll be nice if someone appreciates my work and it will help me make my living of it and invest in quality of things that I am doing.</p>\n<p><strong>How can you support me?</strong></p>\n<p>Of course I will appreciate any upvote, if my posts seem interesting to you. Besides, I think these 30 days marathon will improve my writing skills that is why I will be grateful for any advice and feedback about how I could improve the quality of my posts.</p>\n<p>I don't have any clear plan what I will write about these 30 days. I believe that you need to make a first step to see the way. My life is not a classical success story, the one you took as an example. But I believe that every person is unique and has something to share with others. And if you don't give up and keep believing in your dream, you will reach any heights you want. One day I heard somewhere - \"All that came to your head can be done\". From that moment I live with my faith in it.</p>\n<center><p>https://quotefancy.com/media/wallpaper/1600x900/22525-Walt-Disney-Quote-If-you-can-dream-it-you-can-do-it.jpg<br>\n<a href=\"https://quotefancy.com/media/wallpaper/1600x900/22525-Walt-Disney-Quote-If-you-can-dream-it-you-can-do-it.jpg\">Image credit</a></p></center>\n<p>I have no idea what the results of this experiment will be like. Perhaps, I will just spend my last money in 30 days and will not make something really useful that will help me to earn on Steemit. And maybe I will fulfill the plan minimum with the first posts and be able to focus on the topics that I am really interested in, and not on those that might bring more money.</p>\n<h3>Thank you for reading my post, I would be very grateful for any feedback.</h3>\n</html>",

It does not need to be reciprocated, which means that a human being is able to develop an attachment to another human being without the attachment being shared back. It is identified by certain predictable behaviors in children, like searching for physical closeness to the attachment figure, when a child feels upset or threatened. Responsiveness turns up to be crucial for attachment - it is more important for the child which adult caregiver communicates and plays with him or her, rather than who provides food, changes the clothes or washes him or her.</b>\n\n<h1>Attachment Theory</h1>\n\n<b>Attachment theory </b>is a psychological model that describes how important effect psychological attachment has on individual development. \nIt describes that human being's ability to create emotional and physical attachment to another human being provides a feeling of security and stability for growth, development, risk taking and sustainable development, as a personality. It states that it is essential for child's individual development to have strong emotional and physical attachment to at minimum one primary caregiver. \n\n<b>Attachment behavior in children</b> means behavior that is expressed for the purpose of creating attachment during times when a child is stressed or perplexed. \n<b>Attachment behavior in adult caregivers</b> means the way adult caregivers develop their attachment relationship with the child. For example, how receptive and sensitive an adult is to child's needs.\n\nPsychologist, psychiatrist and psychoanalyst <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bowlby\">John Bowlby</a> is considered as the originator of the Attachment Theory.\nHis theory was developed as an outcome of his years of research of child's developmental psychology. \nAccording to Bowlby's discovery the child firstly develops just one primary attachment to the attachment figure, and after that she or he would use this attachment figure as a <a href=\"http://www.abebe.org.br/wp-content/uploads/John-Bowlby-Attachment-Second-Edition-Attachment-and-Loss-Series-Vol-1-1983.pdf\">secure base </a> for exploration.\n\nLater, developmental psychologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ainsworth\">Mary Ainsworth</a> continued the research and coined the term \"attachment behavior\".\n\nhttp://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg541/Peter_April/rtr_zpsh3zkvisd.jpg\n[Picture <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/what-your-child-shouldnt-bring-to-preschool-2764926\">source</a>]\n\n<h1>Strange Situation Procedure</h1>\n\nMary Ainsworth created a testing method called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_situation\">Strange Situation</a> Classification, that is specifically designed to study different types of child's attachment and behavior. \nThe test is performed by watching the behavior of the child in a set of eight episodes. Each episode lasts around 3 minutes:\n\n1 - The mother, with her child and the experimenter (episode lasts less than 1 minute).\n\n2 - The mother and her child alone.\n\n3 - The stranger comes to join the mother and her child.\n\n4 - Mother leaves her child and the stranger alone.\n\n5 - The mother comes back and the stranger leaves the room.\n\n6 - The mother comes back and the child is left completely alone.\n\n7 - The stranger returns.\n\n8 - The mother comes back and the stranger leaves the room.\n\nThe results were classified in four <b>attachment styles.</b> These attachment styles were assessed according to four interaction behaviors expressed towards the mother in two reunion episodes:\n\n1 - Proximity and contacting seeking\n\n2 - Contact maintaining\n\n3 - Avoidance of proximity and contact\n\n4 - Resistance to contact and comforting \n\nhttp://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg541/Peter_April/rh_zpsrggq8kvc.jpg\n[Picture <a href=\"http://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/starting-preschool/separation-anxiety/\">source</a>]\n\n<h1>Attachment Styles</h1>\n\n<b>Secure Attachment</b>\n\n- Child is stressed when mother leaves the room.\n- Child avoids the stranger when left alone, but becomes friendly when mother is present. \n- Child becomes positive and happy when mother comes back. \n- Child uses the mother as a secure base to explore their environment.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTsewNrHUHU\n\n<b>Insecure Attachment - Anxious-avoidant Attachment</b>\n\n- Child shows no sign of stress when mother leaves the room.\n- Child is fine around the stranger and plays normally when the stranger is present.\n- Child shows little interest when mother comes back.\n- Mother and stranger are able to comfort the child equally well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD771ASTMes\n\n<b>Insecure Attachment - Anxious-ambivalent / Resistant Attachment</b>\n\n- Child shows signs of intense stress when mother leaves the room.\n- Child avoids the stranger and shows fear of stranger.\n- Child approaches the mother but resists physical contact - may attempt to push mother away.\n- Child cries even more and explores less than as in Secure or Anxious-avoidant types.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFXnd4XGivg\n\n<b>Insecure Attachment - Disorganized / Disoriented Attachment</b>\n\n- Child's first impulse is to look for comfort from the mother but when mother comes closer,  the child is afraid to be close.\n- Child shows ambivalent or odd behavior towards the mother. For example, child first runs up to his or her mother and then immediately pulls away. Sometimes child may even run away from the mother, curling up in a ball or trying to hit her.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpQtPsuhLzc\n\nAttachment theory suggests that period between 0 to 5 years is critical for an attachment.\nIf sustainable attachment did not have a chance to develop during this crucial period, then the child will suffer from irreversible developmental consequences such as cognitive or emotional problems such as reduced intelligence, anxieties, aggression etc.\nThe type of attachment which children establish with their attachment figures shapes the way they will create their attachments as adults. Unsustainable attachment during childhood can dramatically impact their adult relationships.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BA8CcEUP84\n\n----\nReferences:\n\n- <a href=\"http://www.abebe.org.br/wp-content/uploads/John-Bowlby-Attachment-Second-Edition-Attachment-and-Loss-Series-Vol-1-1983.pdf\">John Bowlby (1969)  \"Attachment and Loss\"</a>\n\n- <a href=\"https://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~rcfraley/attachment.htm\">Chris Frayley (2010) \"A Brief Overview of Adult Attachment Theory and Research\"</a>\n\n- <a href=\"http://samples.sainsburysebooks.co.uk/9781134168187_sample_496017.pdf\">Colin Murray Parkes (2006) \"Love and Loss\". p. 13\"</a>\n\n----\nAttention: This post has been written by @logic\n\n@knozaki2015 features authors and artist to promote them and a diversity of content. https://steemit.chat/channel/academy (if you want to get in touch)\n\nThe author is responsible for the whole article\n\nThe author will receive 100% of the STEEM Dollars from this post\n\nIf you like this post please support @logic and follow the author",

In the midst of poverty, they develop certain thinking on how to uplift themselves and their families. They are not polished with expensive books but sharpened by life's cruelity. Like a rough diamond that first undergo through many process of scrapping and scrubbing to finally show its true beauty.\n\nOur true talents are shown when we are exposed to difficult situations. We can discover ourselves that the impossible things are really possible ifwe just put effort on trying. We may fail first, but don't get easily tired because nothing in this world can be perfect in just having a single attempt.\n\nDo not force yourself in competing with other people, life is not a battle but a conference wherein we meet different kinds of individuals and get to learn from each other. Being great doesn't mean having neither a nice car nor a diploma but to be able to influence others for the better. Like Mahatma Ghadhi who only owned a pair of slippers, chopsticks, a bowl and a diary. With just that, he was able to mark history not only for his country but for the whole world.\n\nGreat men are poor in material things but rich in morality. Their dignity and respect that they earned from people is very priceless. People nowadays, treasured more about material things and forgetting about the old ways. I'm not saying modernization is a bad thing and technology is a good sign for a comfort life but life is not defined by comfort only, there's struggle and perseverance to survive and many others.\n\nIn this life, what we have is not the basis to define ourselves as humans but instead, let's put our mindset of what we are. Being more human rather than having more treasures is our key in achieving contentment.\n\nSoon we will depart from this world, and we will be seeing God for the first time in person. He will ask you things that I've mentioned before. Everything you had done, things you tried but didn't accomplished,  words that you want to say but never released by your tongue, time you had wasted and all the promises you'd made, these are the things that will be flashed in front of your eyes.\n\n**Follow me @pinoytravel**\n*I write poems, stories, and thoughts in life.*",

    "body": "Back in 1999 after coming back from Puerto Rico I started packing on the pounds.\n\nOn the left is me on July 20th, 2003.  I was around 220 lbs and on the right is me on March 21st, 2012 at 160lbs.\n\n<img src=\"http://mikepotterhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nevertoolate5.jpg\">\n\nAt 42 I thought my life was over. I had constant back pain, I could hardly move and very high cholesterol.\n\n<h1>Taking action</h1>\n\nThen in 2005 I decided to take action to improve my quality of life.\n\nI changed my eating habits (limited sugar and no more fast food) and started exercising.\n\nI started with just walking in the water at the gym.  I think those in their 80's got around better than I did.   After about 8 months I was able to get around better and I found out about a spinning class and started doing that. \n\nhttp://mikepotterhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/mikespin.jpg\n(Me in spin class 2012 after losing weight)\n\nThe first month or so all I could do was light pedaling. Boy what a workout. Then that is when things really started coming off and taking off. \n\n<b>My body did best eating the following</b>\n\n* Breakfast: 1/2 cup berries, palm full of walnuts and natural yogurt.\n* Lunch: Homemade lentil stew.\n* Dinner: switching between salmon, chicken or tuna salad.\n* Snacks being an orange, apple and/or natural nut bar.\n\nIn 2008 I started running outside, cycling  and my classes I take regularly are spinning, bootcamp, body works & zumba.\n\nI ran my first full 26.2 mile marathon on a treadmill in 4 hours 15 minutes at the gym.\n\nhttp://mikepotterhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/treadmarathon.jpg\n\nLater that year I ran 5 competitive full marathons outside and did a 200 mile bike ride the following year.\n\nhttp://mikepotterhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_0766-2-Medium.jpg\n\nIn late 2008 I got a little too thin (I got down to 148 lbs) and so I started making what I call a chunky monkey protein drink.  I'll have to share that sometime.  So good.\n\n<h1>So don't think it is too late to make changes</h1>\n\nHere are my tips:\n\n* Come to a place where you say, enough!\n* Be determined to make the changes\n* Change your diet, like cut out the sugar, drink lots of water and track the calories\n* Start exercising how you can\n* Think about finding a group at the gym to join\n* If you are tempted with food think about the exercise needed to burn it off\n* Have fun!\n\nSoon you will find yourself loving your new fit body.\n\n<h1>Be sure to check out some of my other posts:</h1>\n\n* [How to draw a Stick Figure - Complete full body tutorial](https://steemit.com/art/@mikehere/how-to-draw-a-stick-figure-this-is-for-the-99-99-that-think-they-have-no-talent)\n* [Tropical Paradise - Boracay Philippines - If you need to get away this is it!](https://steemit.com/travel/@mikehere/tropical-paradise-boracay-philippines)\n* [Steemwho.com is now live!

We've all heard the yada yada of how good it is for stress, anxiety, depression as well as for helping us develop a general feeling of contentment and gratitude.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>(If you've been living under a rock and have no idea what I'm talking about, you can check out two awesome posts right here on Steemit, </em><a href=\"https://steemit.com/artificial-intelligence/@infovore/are-we-becoming-more-robotic-are-robots-becoming-more-human-the-delicate-quandary-and-relearning-the-art-of-mindfulness\"><em>this one</em></a><em> by @infovore &amp; </em><a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@sifodyas/mindfulness-starter-kit\"><em>this one</em></a><em> by @sifodyas)</em></p>\n<p>But, to stray a little off the beaten-path, let's quickly check out 3 benefits of mindful meditation that are less talked about and then find out exactly how a single strawberry can change our entire life. Ready?!?<br>\n</p>\n<h2>Benefits Of Mindfulness &amp; Mindful Meditation</h2>\n<p>1. At its core, meditation is about teaching us to create space between our thoughts and our actions, or, to be more accurate, between our thoughts and our <em>reactions</em>. &nbsp;It's difficult to appreciate just how much of <em>every </em>aspect of our life - our thoughts, our actions, our emotions, our beliefs - are on complete and total auto-pilot until you can experience what it looks like from the other side. Essentially, since <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@ltm/don-t-write-or-curate-from-inside-the-matrix\">Matrix references are all the rage right now</a>, meditation is like the Morpheus to our Neo; without his/its guidance, not only would we never escape our all-encompassing prison, but we'd never even know we were trapped inside one! As the famed psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl &nbsp;so wisely said:</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/6sc8bot5r/viktor.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"254\"/></center></p>\n<p>2. A mindful meditation practice will help you appreciate the \"little things\" in life that are, in fact, not even remotely \"little\". These supposedly \"little\" parts of our lives are actually composed of, oh you know, just the sounds you hear, the aromas you smell, and, as we'll soon discover, the things you taste. I don't know about you, but none of these \"things\" seems very \"little\" at all. In fact, it sort of sounds like the entire makeup of the human experience, right?</p>\n<p>3. Lastly, and <em>definitely </em>most importantly, meditation will enable you to truly see once and for all that <strong>your thoughts are not you</strong>! Your thoughts do not control you, your thoughts do not dictate what you do, and your thoughts <em>absolutely </em>do not determine what kind of person you get to be! Or, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that your thoughts<em> don't have to</em> dictate the person you get to be. Because, if you allow them to, they will! And more likely than not, they will make you miserable your entire life. You can take that promise to the bank!</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://www.davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy_images/stories/May201399/1206_573136002709416_86696975_n.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"523\"/></center></p>\n<p>With that said, mindfulness is one of those things that will forever be devoid of any real meaning until YOU experience it for yourself. &nbsp;So let's get to it, shall we?<br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Mindful Eating Meditation</strong></p>\n<p>Prep:</p>\n<p>Get yourself an item of food to work with. Generally this exercise is done with a raisin, but in my opinion the experience is much more magnified with a more succulent food like a strawberry (or a peach!). However, any small piece of food will do. \u201cReal\u201d foods (fruits, veggies, nuts etc) are preferred but if you <em>must </em>practice with Cheetos or even a stick of gum, that'll work too! Whatever it takes!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So go on and grab something. Seriously, go. Don't just skim over think and think that just by reading it you'll \u201cget the idea, man\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Uh, it's like, no dude, you won't! That's, like, the whole point...man. It's not an idea, it's an experience! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Besides, it's so easy to do and so incredibly worthwhile so even if you generally tell these articles to go f themselves, decide to instead turn that middle finger towards the part of your mind that's resisting such a powerful human experience and use this opportunity to <strong>test your resolve against your own mind's will</strong>. So go on now, go get that strawberry and let's get started. &nbsp;Go!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step One:</strong></p>\n<p>Minimize any distractions that may be present such as noise from an open window or the latest Mr. Robot episode playing on a loop in the background (it's OK dawg, we've all been there!), and sit upright in a comfortable position that embodies the feeling of being awake. Now gently place the strawberry in the palm of your hand and take a deep breath. Have you done it? Congratulations, you are now meditating!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/ewpb2erpp/viktor.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"511\"/></center><br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Step Two:</strong></p>\n<p>Spend a moment looking at the strawberry as if you had never seen one before. Imagine how an alien would inspect it should s/he be told of its great wonders. What would s/he see? What would it be curious about? Looking at every-day objects in this way is what's known as <em>Beginner's Eye</em>.</p>\n<p>Continue experiencing the strawberry in this way for a moment longer. What do <em>you </em>see? What colors? What shapes? What texture can you feel against your fingers?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now take it a step further and see if you can stop \"<em>thinking</em>\" about the answers to all these questions and just <em>experience </em>them instead.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spend a moment in this practice before moving on to step three.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/6opmou1sf/smell.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\"/></center></p>\n<p><strong>Step Three:</strong></p>\n<p>Now that you've taken a thorough inventory of what a strawberry <em>really </em>looks like (sorta trippy, isn't it?), take a moment and bring it up to your nose like a world-class strawberry (or Cheetos) connoisseur. Repeat the exercise from above but shift the focus to your sense of smell, remembering to experience it all as if for the very first time.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/drmlzy6qv/mouth.png\" width=\"638\" height=\"360\"/></center></p>\n<p><strong>Step Four:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alright, it's time to for the big dance, mouth action! Not so fast though, slow down! Begin by placing the strawberry against your lips so that you can spend a second feeling it's texture before placing it into your mouth. Now as you begin to move it around your mouth and eventually chew, make each action as slow and deliberate as possible, really paying attention to the various sensations that are present.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice the texture on your tongue, the taste on the roof of your mouth, the juices and saliva turning it all into an easily digestible powerball of life-energy. But don't swallow just yet! Now's an important time to start paying attention to some of the powerful impulses our body has and begin building the muscle of intention by imposing our will over both our mind <em>and </em>our body. This means that when you feel the impulse to swallow whatever it is you're chewing on, <strong>spend a few seconds denying the impulse gratification</strong> before making a conscious and deliberate decision to begin to swallow while remaining aware of the sensations of the food making it's way to the back of your throat and as far down as you can track it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://www.hemensaglik.com/Uploads/PageContentImages/30987/daha-iyi-sekse-dogru-ye-egzersiz-yap-gevse-ve-uyu-cttvm.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\"/></center></p>\n<p><strong>Step Five:</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, return to your upright position one final time and turn your attention to all the lingering sensations in and around your mouth and throat. This time forget all the questions and instructions and just observe what is. Simply be, alone, with yourself, until it is your time to move on.</p>\n<p>Congratulations friend, you are now officially a mindful meditator! How do you feel??</p>\n<p>Until next time,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Namaste</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://d1cbd38ccca324f2c466-57bc17d0d0a5ce9d3d690dec61bab23c.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/17ca6195965ddd87ac37dab3664088cd_scale190x150.jpg\" width=\"190\" height=\"143\"/></center></p>\n<p><center>&nbsp;~ ~ ~</center></p>\n<h3>Stay tuned for more <a href=\"https://steemit.com/poker/@ltm/the-time-i-almost-bustoed-my-entire-life\">Blogs</a>, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/sports/@ltm/the-working-man-s-approach-to-daily-fantasy-sports-know-your-numbers\">Sports</a>, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/writing/@ltm/courage-my-love-an-original-novel-part-1\">Fiction</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@ltm/don-t-write-or-curate-from-inside-the-matrix\">Content Strategy</a> by clicking each individual link or hitting the follow button <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@ltm\">@ltm</a>.</h3>\n<h3>Also I'd love to hear from you so please leave me a comment below with your feedback and remember to click that upvote button if you enjoyed the story!

The 26 year old aspiring writer was working in the north tower of the world trade center on the morning of the September 11th attacks in 2001.  The official narrative from the government puts Bobby on the 106th floor and claims that he died due to the impact of the airplane but Bob continues to point out that the evidence suggests that Bobby died due to an explosion while entering the lobby prior to the first plane hitting the tower.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kmWnaT7LD-c",

Instead, the vehicle swerved to hit me, and I found myself on the sweltering hot hood of a car with a pissed off peace officer looking at me through the windshield.</p>\n<p><h3>\"I KNOW you got caught smoking marijuana in the state park,\" said the small town public servant that had just intentionally hit me. \"Did you think I wouldn't find out? You're in a lot of trouble!\"</h3></p>\n<p>Peeling myself off the car's hood, I limped to her open driver's side window to better receive this scolding. My skateboard was rolling away.</p>  \n<p>\"I know. It was stupid. I'm sorry,\" I admitted to this cop that had taught drug abuse resistance education to my fifth grade glass a few years prior.</p> \n<p><h3>It did not seem at all wise to point out that hitting a 14 year old kid with a car was way worse than smoking weed in the park.</h3></p> \n<p>Nor did it seem prudent to mention that the park ranger who had caught me in the act of getting stoned also lectured me thoroughly on the dangers of marijuana while driving me out to the middle of nowhere so I could \"think about what I had done\" on a several-mile-walk back to town.</p> \n<p>So I just stood there and feigned attentiveness so as to prevent this well-intentioned maniac-with-a-badge from feeling like she needed to further physically accost me to make her point.</p>\n<p><h3>Obviously I learned my lesson.</h3></p>  \n<p>The lesson that I learned was that people who saw things differently than I did would sometimes cause trouble for me if they knew my business.</p>\n<p>I've since noticed that the visceral here-and-now of experiential REAL rests upon the stories we tell ourselves and each other about ourselves and each other in a given moment. And people tell all kinds of stories. So, given the incredible diversity that exists among people, I have come to see reality itself as pluralistic.</p>\n<p>http://i65.tinypic.com/v6l0ro.png</p> \n<p><h3>We live alongside one another, but do not necessarily inhabit the same world.</h3></p>\n<p>http://i67.tinypic.com/2zocdxt.jpg</p>\n<p><sup>(pic of me on peculiar double-exposed photo)</sup></p>\n<p>As it happens, this pluralistic nature of reality has become much easier to see from the comfort of our own homes in recent years. The ubiquity of technologies that radicalize transparency have seen to that. It has consequently become very easy to pay attention to people who do not see the world in the same way that you do at all. And, having been born in 1981, I've been watching this technologically-mediated radicalization of transparency mutate out society since I was old enough to start paying attention to such things. Which makes me wonder:</p>\n<p><h3>What does it mean to be part of the generation which came of age alongside the world wide web?</h3></p> \n<p>This generation bridged the gap between prior generations and so called 'digital natives.' It beta tested postindustrial culture. And we have been called all sorts of names.</p> \n<p>First, we were late genX, then it was early genY, now we are apparently 'millennials'. These labels are mostly employed to describe variables in a formula that demographically types us for marketing and other consumer-identity-related purposes. Whatever.</p> \n<p><h3>I call us <em>accidentally the generation</em>, because our forbears probably didn't break the world on purpose.</h3></p>\n<blockquote><em>\u201cI Accidentally is a catchphrase. . . that exploits the imagination of English speaking internet users. By constructing a complete sentence that begins with \u201cI accidentally\u201d and then removing the verb, one creates a very confusing sentence left to the\nimagination.\u201d</em> (originated with a 4chan message on May 1 9th, 2008 according to knowyourmeme.com)</blockquote>\n<p>We in The States inherited a far less prosperous country than those that came before us inherited. And our arrival coincided with some big shifts in the ordering of society.</p> \n<p>As far back as the records go, for example, the number of people incarcerated in the US had been growing at approximately the same rate as our general population. Suddenly, the powers that be started putting far more people behind bars, and for far longer.</p> \n<p>Prior to this, of course, the debt-to-earnings ratio for the average worker had decoupled from its previous trend-line. Debt has skyrocketed throughout our lives, while real earnings have remained the same or declined for all but the most wealthy of our citizenry.</p>\n<p>By the time <em>accidentally</em> showed up, the US manufacturing sector had been mostly dismantled and outsourced. The agricultural base of this country was restructured to eliminate the jobs of small-scale, traditional farmers. The education system had been consolidated to eliminate small, community and neighborhood schools in favor of much larger institutions. The financial system was restructured throughout, to reflect and propagate these and other changes, and the political process at all levels was reduced to a theatrical mechanism of the financial elites' technologically-augmented influence.</p>\n<p>Coinciding with these and other fundamental changes in the ordering of our society, a new medical industry was born. Discoveries in many areas related to health and biology were translated into legislative, research, treatment, and marketing strategies with reckless abandon. A few profoundly beneficial practices were put into place, but the massive restructuring of our societal underpinnings made it possible for other, extremely\nharmful practices to become standardized at the same time.</p>\n<p>These helpful and harmful practices were integrated into our society simultaneously, and sorting the good from the bad in any meaningful way became so complex as to be time and cost prohibitive for individuals, health care providers, educators, and lawmakers. Meanwhile, further elimination of the means by which to differentiate between helpful and harmful health care practices was made extremely profitable by the economic restructuring that had taken place, so that a powerful incentive existed for the financial elite to promote all new practices, regardless of their actual, long term health benefits. By the year 2000, iatrogenic deaths, produced by medical error, <a href=\"http://www.drug-education.info/documents/iatrogenic.pdf\">far outnumbered</a> all crime and most disease deaths, yet came to be conspicuously omitted from most cause-of-death charts.</p> \n<p>These sorts of things and more incubated the production of the US at present, wherein more than one third of us will get cancer and one million suicide attempts take place every year. Wherein our economy is crumbling, our government is spying on us, and our medicine is killing us. Wherein our access to genuinely nutritious, whole food has been mostly eliminated, and the means by which to produce this food ourselves have been made largely unavailable to us by economic and legal circumstances.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, although we have so far gotten the short end of the stick, tools capable of actually changing the world are increasingly at our fingertips. You are reading this as part of a beta test of one of these tools right now.</p>\n<p>http://i68.tinypic.com/felx07.jpg</p> \n<p>With such tools becoming widely accessible, and now that the world has been turned into a giant small town wherein everybody can pay attention to everybody else's business, handling reality pluralism in traditional ways - by ignoring or attempting to eliminate it - is probably not a great plan.</p>\n<p><h3>So maybe, part of what belonging to the generation which came of age alongside the world wide web means is paying attention to reality's irreconcilable disjointedness, and responding to it in better ways than those that came before us.</h3></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>We\u2019ve all been there. Having conversations with ourselves. There seems to be a voice inside us all that magically appear when we are trying to think of something or trying to make a decision. In that moment, we feel like we are two people talking to each other, to figure out what to do. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t even have to be a decision, we randomly converse with ourselves on random subject matters.</p>\n<p>So who are those voices? Are they one and the same? Maybe, maybe not. But I like to think that they are the heart and the mind. In a figurative speech of manner at least. One sees the rationale of things and the other, emotional value. One sees probabilities and the other possibilities. Of course, it is the brain that does the former and the heart that does the latter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I find it fascinating that we can have conflicting conversations with ourselves. That we can see things from different perspectives, coming to a conclusion about our judgement only after careful consideration. Doesn\u2019t it tell you how awesome mother nature has been in our evolution?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/3wrz50ugh/brain_heart_characters.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"775\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-love-mri-scan-reveals-what-stages-romantic-love-youre-brain-map-326080\">Image Credits</a></p>\n<p>I just like to notice the type of conversations we have with ourselves in different scenarios. It\u2019s quite entertaining actually. In the moment, it feels all justified and important but while remembering it later, it feels so stupid and funny. So, lets look at some scenarios where they are in a tug of war.</p>\n<h1>Scenario 1: Seeing a beautiful girl at the bar</h1>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>Hey, check her out! She\u2019s beauuuuutiful!!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Yeah, she is!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>Should we go talk to her?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>No, I don\u2019t think so. She is way out of our league.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>What\u2019s the harm in trying?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Umm, disappointment? rejection? humiliation?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>You\u2019re a wuss! I am doing it.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Don\u2019t you dare!</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Scenario 2: Trying to get work done</h1>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>So, that new movie is coming out this friday. We should book the tickets.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Ok, soon.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>So, the weather is fine today, huh?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Yeah it is.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>Hey, do you feel hungry?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>:<em> I\u2019m trying to work here! Go away.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known\u2026</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Seriously? You are singing a Green Day song while I\u2019m trying to work? Stop it!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>I wonder if aliens are real!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>I give up\u2026..</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Scenario 3: Trying to save money</h1>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>Let\u2019s buy that new iPhone.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>We can\u2019t. We are trying to save money, remember?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>But I really want one!&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>No, we can\u2019t afford one right now.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>Ok at least lets get that smartwatch.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Seriously??</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>Fine!!! I\u2019ll stop\u2026\u2026\u2026 You don\u2019t love me like you used to anymore :(</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>\u2028Scenario 4: Trying to lose weight</h1>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Yes!! Lost 2 kgs till now. On the right track!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>You call eating garbage food, \u201con the right track\u201d?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Healthy food is not garbage. It\u2019s those packaged products that are garbage.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>But it\u2019s all so tasteless. Where\u2019s the joy in that!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>No I won\u2019t listen to you this time.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>You know what\u2019s NOT tasteless? A pizza. A delicious plate of pastry. Some Chinese food.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Yeah, a pizza would be really nice right about now.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>So, let\u2019s order one\u2026Do it! \u2026. Do it! \u2026. Do it!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>OK! \u2026\u2026\u2026.. F &nbsp;my life!</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Scenario 5: Binge watching a TV show</h1>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>Isn\u2019t this nice, relaxing and entertaining?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Yeah, it is. But we\u2019ve got to finish that project. Don\u2019t want to make bossman angry.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>Don\u2019t talk! Just watch.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>Great we\u2019ve completed half a season. Let\u2019s watch the rest tomorrow.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>NO! One more won\u2019t hurt. Just one more.</em></p>\n<p>*5 episodes later*</p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>It\u2019s 2 am already. Need to go to sleep. We\u2019ll finish that project when we wake up now.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>Just ONE. MORE. EPISODE.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: <em>You are one crazy s.o.b</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: <em>Touche! Douche!</em></p>\n<p>*10 more episodes later*</p>\n<p><strong>Eyes</strong>: <em>Umm guys?? I think I can\u2019t see anymore.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heart &amp; Brain</strong>: <em>Fiiiineeee!!!</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/a5tfgaqi1/hgcghc.png\" width=\"287\" height=\"314\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theawkwardyeti.com\">Image Credits</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Don't forget to follow me @sauravrungta.

Three days ago I arrived in Valencia, Spain, where I'll be living for over five months during my student exchange. During the last two days, I've been staying in a B&amp;B in the old city centre. I was a bit worried as my university starts tomorrow and I had no room yet. I have explored another area and found a house in the area of the Blasco Iba\u00f1ez, an area close to the beach and surrounded by night life, restaurants and beautiful parks.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-mad1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14224843_1251238881586871_7484098528036445868_n.jpg?oh=51638a442eff188bd3ceed2cf7a25900&amp;oe=583FE4E1\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\"/></p>\n<p>Photo: selfie in the new living room (which still has to be decorated:P)</p>\n<h3>Blasco Iba\u00f1ez</h3>\n<p>I decided to live in this area because this area is full of students, night life and its location is amazing. Blasco Iba\u00f1ez is located 10 minutes (by bike) from Playa de Levante, the beach in Valencia and 15 minutes from the old city centre. The area is full of restaurants, clubs and it's mainly known for its 3 km long nature park street.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.beroomers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blasco-ibanez-algiros-neighbourhood.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"/></p>\n<p>Photo: view on the Blasco Iba\u00f1ez park (3 km long)</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.celebrityradio.biz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Valencia-Beach-Review-2014-4.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Photo: Valencia Beach, located 10 minutes from my new house</p>\n<h3>New House</h3>\n<p>September is quite late to search for a student house, so I couldn't have hoped any better. I found a large house in an amazing area and it has a roof terrace, large living room, kitchen and all this for a good price. It's crazy how things can change day by day!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-mad1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14195235_1296921933682003_8717750005846102838_o.jpg\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\"/></p>\n<p>Photo: roof terrace of the new house</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-mad1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14086205_1296922160348647_7458543948715668829_o.jpg\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\"/></p>\n<p>Photo: large living room in the new house</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-mad1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14196079_1296922017015328_5900835103453908798_o.jpg\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\"/></p>\n<p>Photo: large kitchen in the house&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>It's funny... on the first day I asked myself.. what am I starting with? I had no house and didn't know anyone yet. Now on day 3, I'm writing behind my laptop in my big living room surrounded by new room mates. It's amazing how fast things can change. I'm looking forward to the coming months. I'll be staying here until february and tomorrow I'll be going to the university to attend the Welcome Day. There are gonna be a lot of amazing experiences, I'm sure about it and I look forward to share them with you.</h3>\n<p>#life #travel #inspiration #studentlife</p>\n<p>Read my first post about Valencia: <a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@chrisadventures/from-the-netherlands-to-spain-part-1-life-abroad-starting-my-life-in-a-totally-strange-city-and-lost-my-debit-card-on-day-1-by\">click here</a></p>\n</html>",

Well I am telling you it is time to put fun and games back into your life.</p>\n<center>http://www.buildfaith.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/jumpingblue-1024x725.jpg</center>\n<p><strong>We work hard and so we should play hard. What is it that you like to do for fun and haven\u2019t done in a long time?</strong></p>\n<p>There may be more than one thing and that is great I want you to do them all in time. Make time in your schedule for fun and play each week and have fun and laugh. These don\u2019t need to be things that cost a lot, just what you love to do. See how excited you are getting just thinking about it. Do it and see how you feel and remember that feeling as it will be a good feeling and you may need more of that in your life.</p>\n<p>By having fun and laughing, it will help you to relieve stress in your life and take your mind off things for a while, and maybe get an answer to a problem you have been dealing with or thinking of.</p>\n<blockquote>When we were younger, all we knew was how to play and have fun and laugh. Just because we grow up doesn\u2019t mean that we need to forget to have fun in life. Try something new and feel like a kid again. Give it a try. Be a kid and have fun and just enjoy yourself.</blockquote>\n<p>Play is different for everyone so don\u2019t push your play on to someone else or vice versa. Only you know what you feel is fun and that is true about everyone. There is no time limit on fun, just make sure to have fun at least once a week for your health, more is better.</p>\n<h1>Laugh everyday, it is good for the spirit.</h1>\n<center>https://thecliparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/free-laughing-clipart-2.jpg</center>\n<h2>List of ideas for you;</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Watch a funny movie</li>\n  <li>Go camping</li>\n  <li>Play a sport, learn a new one</li>\n  <li>Go dancing</li>\n  <li>Take a trip</li>\n  <li>Go out with friends</li>\n  <li>Walk around the house naked</li>\n  <li>Try something new</li>\n  <li>Skydive</li>\n  <li>Art project</li>\n  <li>Make jigsaw puzzles</li>\n  <li>Ski</li>\n  <li>Surf</li>\n  <li>Learn a musical instrument</li>\n  <li>Write a book</li>\n  <li>Dance class</li>\n  <li>Anything that makes you happy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See what others you can add to the list, but this should get you started. What brings a smile to you when you think about play or fun?</p>\n<p>When was the last time you had fun or really laughed from the belly? What fun are you going to have this day or week? What are you going to do all the time for fun and games?</p>\n<h1>Go and have fun today.</h1>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>I lost my money, though I feel happy about it. Running a business that smacks your fundings like a cocktail is not easy, especcially if the only revenue it brings is an entrepreneur status (well, having business cards with your company e-mail, telephone and your name is cool as hell). Still, to go on you need a flame burning inside, a desire, a passion to continue so that you're full of inspiration and new ideas. Unfortunately, I lost the starter's eagerness and heat. Though, I don't worry about that as I know that after a serie of failures there will difinitely come success.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://i.imgsafe.org/3614a7e222.jpg</p>\n<p>In this post I would like to cover some of the reasons for why I failed and share the valuable experience obtained. I hope that there can be some future entrepreneurs to read the article and draw conclusions so that they don't make my mistakes.</p>\n<p>https://i.imgsafe.org/361a59247e.jpg</p>\n<h2>It was not that easy from the very beginning</h2>\n<p>...as I chose the neiche with extremely tough competition on the market, namely nail polish, scrabbs and stuff like that. Not being a typical chick myself it was quite difficult for me to get how they think and what criteria is decisive for them to buy a product. I tried to organise the content in an unusual and beautiful way and they found it too complicated; I designed a dark website myself so that it looked original but they considered it to be too exotic. A seria of trials, public polls and consultations didn't give my the wished answers: I still have it difficult to understand how their mind works.</p>\n<p>https://i.imgsafe.org/3622f0a8ed.jpg</p>\n<h2>Never use wix.com constructor,</h2>\n<p>... I mean. When I thought of creating a website I had really little money and that's why I decided to use an online-constructor wix.com. That was actually my crucial mistake. Designing the fashionable dark website I could hardly imagine that there was a mistake in its Java-Script and it would not function properly. I learned about the thing when I paid for the Wix services and published the website. Though it took some time for me to realize that it was not me to be responsible for the bugs and the site's being slow as hell. Furthermore, it was very difficult to organize the long rows of items and products we sold and so we decided to make two lending pages (still another mistake) on wix.com.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://i.imgsafe.org/361dee9152.png</p>\n<p>Here come the links so that you can enjoy the greatest Frankenstein webmonsters ever :'(</p>\n<p>www.luckylakishop.com<br>\nwww.luckylakigoods.com<br>\nwww.luckylakiset.com&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>One good item in the showcase is better than a row of trinkets</h2>\n<p>... especcially in the very beginning. We tried to offer as many goods as possible and that was our mistake. It's much better to choose one good item to sell and advertise it properly (that would be much cheeper btw) than to spread your fundings on cheep and ineffective advertising of many goods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://i.imgsafe.org/3625795052.png</p>\n<h2>I lost my money and I feel happy about shutting my business</h2>\n<p>... simply because I got tired of the bugs, mistakes, silly quiestions of my customers and beauty-industry. My payment is the experience obtained: now I know the laws of targeting ads, can manage an Instagram campain, know how to report accounts and where to find copywriters. I've learned so much about SEO, SMM, PR and can &nbsp;be a bit more objective in the future.</p>\n<p>https://i.imgsafe.org/362751305f.png</p>\n<p><strong>They say a good businessman fails seven times on average before they launch a good start-up.

    "body": "There are six great apes: Eastern gorilla, Western gorilla, Bornean orangutan, Sumatran orangutan, common chimpanzee and bonobo.\nThe Eastern gorilla now joins three other great primates, as being critically endangered, and added to the <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/news/four-out-six-great-apes-one-step-away-extinction-%E2%80%93-iucn-red-list\">red list</a> posted by <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. Other critically endangered great apes are Western gorilla, Bornean orangutan and Sumatran orangutan. The remaining two, common chimpanzee and bonobo are listed as endangered.\n\nThe Eastern gorilla is divided into two subspecies: Grauer's gorilla and mountain gorilla. There are only about 800 of mountain gorillas left  and about 3,800 Grauer's gorillas. Their number have been decimated due to illegal capturing and hunting for meat. \n\nhttp://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg541/Peter_April/grauer_s_gorilla_zpsxafggyw9.jpg\n[ Grauer's gorillas. Picture <a href=\"http://www.wwf-congobasin.org/?264831/Catastrophic-collapse-of-Grauers-gorillas\">source</a> ]\n\nhttp://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg541/Peter_April/mountain_zpscvx3yzn3.jpg\n[ Mountain gorillas. Picture <a href=\"http://deforestation.besaba.com/endangered.php\">source</a> ]\n\nNumbers of Sumatran and Bornean orangutans have dramatically declined due to the effect of destruction of their natural habitat caused by deforestation. Orangutan's native rain forest has been systematically destroyed through logging (illegal and legal) and transformation to agricultural land or palm oil plantations.\nPalm oil companies are the major contributor to destruction of rain forest in Sumatra and Borneo. Palm oil is used in many cosmetics and food products. \n\nhttp://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg541/Peter_April/Bornean-Orangutan_zps0szkuqfl.jpg\n[ Bornean orangutans.

Picture <a href=\"http://true-wildlife.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/sumatran-orang-utan.html/\">source</a> ]\n\nCommon chimpanzee and bonobo are considered to be under threat of extinction. The main threats to these species are destruction of habitat, commercial poaching, disease and human population growth.\n\nhttp://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg541/Peter_April/chimpanzee_zpswgebepde.jpg\n[ Common chimpanzees.

    "body": "<html>\n<p>After yesterday <a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@lehard/is-it-possible-to-make-money-on-steemit-30-days-steemit-experiment\">article</a> was published a good friend of mine called me. We talked about the article and he had drawn my attention to its headline - <strong>\u00abIs it possible to make money on Steemit? 30-days Steemit experiment\".</strong></p>\n<p>There is nothing unusual at first sight, but it absolutely does not reflect neither the essence of the article nor my goal. Thank you Kamil, you are looking deeper into the essence of things as always.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The key idea of the headline is <strong>cashing on Steemit</strong>. But is it the most important thing for me? <strong>No.</strong> And what if we put the question this way: Is it important for Steemit itself in general, for its users and creators that I cash on it? What sort of lunacy is this? <strong>Nobody gives a damn about it.</strong></p>\n<center><p>http://i.imgur.com/1ARw8Jc.jpg<br>\n<a href=\"http://vinccitsui.com/blog/2015/05/why-diets-work-dont-work-at-the-same-time-a-case-study/\">Image credit</a></p></center>\n<p>In the headline I am like that man with a penknife, standing above a bleeding victim of gunfire from <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@lehard/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-a-better-person-and-all-of-us\">a story</a> I wrote a month ago.</p>\n<p>So what is important then? Creating of value for others - that's what is important. In my circle of contacts we name it <strong>\"causing irreparable benefit\"</strong>. &nbsp;To make your dream come true with the help of Steemit, to show that it is possible and to inspire other people - that's what is truly important for me.</p>\n<p>Why is Steemit a hundred, or even a thousand times cooler than Facebook, YouTube and other social networks for embodiment of your talents? According to many popular bloggers you need about 5 years of hard work on YouTube to start earning your first money. Not amazing amount of money, but it will make it possible for you to pay for living, spend more time on your creative work and invest into increasing the quality of it. Judging on my personal experience with Steemit, it might happen right after your first or, in my case, after your second posting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first SD cashed on Steemit I spent on increasing the quality of my content. I was disappointed after publishing <a href=\"https://steemit.com/help/@lehard/steemit-for-dummies-guide-for-newbies-en-ru-fr-nl\">the first beginners guide</a>, which got more than 150 upvotes and brought only 1.5 SD))) But I got lucky, my work was noticed by @cryptoctopus and he had simply sent me 37 dollars saying - For that great post of yours: https://steemit.com/help/@lehard/steemit-for-dummies-guide-for-newbies-en-ru-fr-nl&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I was delighted!</strong> 150 upvotes showed me that I was doing something valuable and really important for people, and 37 SD allowed me to invest into quality of my work. I've made <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemhelp/@lehard/steemit-for-dummies-5-simple-steps-from-beginner-to-steemian-80-lvl-50-useful-links-2-edition\">a second version</a>, which contained more text, translated by a professional translator (I'm reminding that I'm not good with English myself).</p>\n<p>My efforts didn't come unnoticed. After an upvote from @smooth my posting was noticed and it had collected 1800 dollars. It was unreal money for me, I felt great responsibility and I wanted to do something greater.</p>\n<p>After this post another whale @steemed had added me to his bot-list. But instead of taking advantage of the moment and maximizing profit, I have drowned myself in studying all the specific features of Steemit. I began consulting with more experienced people, asking silly questions regarding technical details and together with a friend of mine we started working on the text of a new guide, in order to make it as simple and as clear for everyone as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks to cash made from the previous post I was able to hire a more experienced translator and order original illustrations. <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemhelp/@lehard/beginner-s-guide-steemian-s-adventures-in-wonderland-part-1\">All this work</a> took us 10 days, and after it we were working on <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemhelp/@lehard/beginner-s-guide-part-2-steemit-how-the-hell-does-it-work\">the second part</a> for another week. And then the wind had changed, and the fairytale was over)))</p>\n<center><p>http://file2.answcdn.com/answ-cld/image/upload/f_jpg,w_672,c_fill,g_faces:center,q_70/v1452206276/bc1sk1fwhn26w9acshv4.jpg<br>\n<a href=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://file2.answcdn.com/answ-cld/image/upload/f_jpg,w_672,c_fill,g_faces:center,q_70/v1452206276/bc1sk1fwhn26w9acshv4.jpg\">Image credit</a></p></center>\n<p>The observant users who have noticed me getting into bot-list asked me why I posted articles so seldom. Answering this question now, I realize that money itself is not the goal for me. Money is only a tool, to make something really classy and extraordinary.</p>\n<center><p><strong>So how should the topic of my post sound like?</strong></p>\n<h1><em>Is it possible to embody your Steemit dream?<br>\n30-days Steemit experiment.</em></h1>\n<p>https://i.imgsafe.org/09d57b024a.jpg</p></center>\n<p>I already feel sure to answer yes, because Steemit had already helped me to embody one dream. I dreamed of living in Moscow long ago and especially because of Steemit I've been here for two weeks already.</p>\n</html>",

Sister (left), me (second-left), mother and brother in law (right)</p>\n<h3>Goodbye Holland</h3>\n<p>Yesterday I said goodbye to my family and now I'm sitting behind my laptop in my bed and breakfast in the old centre of Valencia, Spain! Some of you might know me, others might not.. I'm Chris, a student and traveller from the Netherlands and since yesterday I moved to Valencia in Spain to study here for over 5 months. A leap of faith, step into the unknown... call it whatever you want, but exciting it is! I decided to live here because I want to experience life in a city at the beach where I can study Business, learn water sports (wave and kite surf) and master a world language (Spanish).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14199631_1250174715026621_6051509730735225767_n.jpg?oh=e9481ec33982821d2bb84f4836a146f4&amp;oe=587DA3E5\" width=\"960\" height=\"639\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Photo:</strong> morning surf in Oferta Surf Camp, Valencia (photo source: <a href=\"https://www.google.es/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipmfT21PLOAhUCWSwKHS3rDI8QjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ruralsurf.com%2Fes%2Foferta-surfcamp-de-invierno%2F&amp;bvm=bv.131783435,d.bGg&amp;psig=AFQjCNGLwnXkx3-Lpi6kRnbe13Ze09Qv3g&amp;ust=1472973542173639\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>At first.. last days have been full of worrying. Will everything be well-arranged? Who will be my new friends? Won't I get bored or miss home? Will I have enough money? Will I even find a room to live? So much had been going on in my mind and let me tell you, that's a good thing for sure! This new step comes with uncertainties and worrying but I believe such a time will be amazing as long as you want it to be so..&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As always, I wasn't well prepared.. As I came back from Greece three days before my departure to Spain, I'm still not sure about my Learning Agreement, have no student room yet and ordered my laptop three days before leaving... but the laptop is great btw:)!</p>\n<p>Yesterday has been a rollercoaster. I was a bit sad leaving the Netherlands, arrived on Valencia airport where I comfortably sat down with a pint to relax and ended up sweating in old town Valencia streets searching my way to the B&amp;B with my luggage and a temperature of over 33 degrees celcius. I realized the old centre of Valencia is soo beautiful and the B&amp;B was located in the middle of the old centre next to the Cathedral and Plaza de la Virgin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14183862_1250161445027948_1557630352475593054_n.jpg?oh=0406c833a3649d1d1c92d41ef50ad7d9&amp;oe=583EE899\" width=\"620\" height=\"286\"/></p>\n<p>Photo: Plaza de la Virgin, right at my doorstep (photo source: <a href=\"https://www.google.es/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqws2wz_LOAhVDCSwKHWb4CSoQjRwIBw&amp;url=%2Furl%3Fsa%3Di%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%26esrc%3Ds%26source%3Dimages%26cd%3D%26cad%3Drja%26uact%3D8%26ved%3D0ahUKEwiqws2wz_LOAhVDCSwKHWb4CSoQjRwIBw%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.valenciaesturismo.com%252Flugares%252Funa-plaza-con-gran-encanto-la-plaza-de-la-virgen%252F%26bvm%3Dbv.131783435%2Cd.bGg%26psig%3DAFQjCNFklTeDJ1At8ItkZQJxtLu37u-eGg%26ust%3D1472972064585372&amp;bvm=bv.131783435,d.bGg&amp;psig=AFQjCNFklTeDJ1At8ItkZQJxtLu37u-eGg&amp;ust=1472972064585372\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rHo5rWYpTN8/Ud_QowcRoXI/AAAAAAAAGGg/wlC0EMiBad0/s1600/Aerial-view-of-City-of-Arts-and-Science-Valencia-700x467.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\"/></p>\n<p>Photo: city of arts and sciences, Valencia (photo source: <a href=\"https://www.google.es/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib9N-92PLOAhWFkywKHf4OAQQQjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nevworldwonders.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fpreview-city-of-arts-and-sciences.html&amp;bvm=bv.131783435,d.bGg&amp;psig=AFQjCNHs4xZmuOlsLddLms4QnCgGlcloZQ&amp;ust=1472974669393252\">click here</a>)</p>\n<h3>Losing my debit card on day 1....</h3>\n<p>On such a day, full of new experiences, I allow myself to eat some fast food so I sat down at the McDonald's for some fast easy (and unhealthy) dinner :-)... I had paid for my food using my debit card. Unfortunately, I had put my debit card on the food tray which I ended up throwing in the trash can. Later that evening, I realized that I had lost my debit card there. The McDonald's hadn't found&nbsp;it and searching all trash cans wasn't an option at all. At day 1.... losing your debit card... I felt a like total retard. How can I live abroad for 5 months if I can't even keep my debit card safe for a day? Anyways, I've accepted the fact and I'll have to wait for the new card. I have blocked the debit card and now I'll wait for the new debit card from the Netherlands. Until then, I'll be dependent on others. I'll have to transfer money to someone else's bank account so they can give me cash. Not the best way, but it works.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The coming time I hope to write and share photos about my experiences. At this very moment, I don't know anyone yet, I have no student house and no debit card. It is soo exciting in a way, quite a bit out of my comfort zone but I know things will work out, they always do! The coming days, I'll have to search for a student house. I hope to find a nice one, in a nice region with parks, shops, a gym, near the university and nearby the night life. I'm looking forward to the coming time and I'm curious what time will bring. I think this step brings a lot of opportunities to do the things I want to do. Although, it's a bit uncomfortable to take the step it will end up perfectly.</h3>\n<h3>#life #travel #inspirational #introduceyourself&nbsp;#student</h3>\n<p>Read my second Valencia Post: Was Homeless but Found An Amazing House!

    "body": "<html>\n<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/_32ebb7b.jpg</p>\n<p>Have you ever wanted to start looking for gold but don't really know where to look? Well, the place to go might not be as far as might think...</p>\n<p>Before I give away my secret spot though, I'd like to give you a little backstory first.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One day a few months back my family and I were out at the Salt River doing some fishing, swimming, and basically just playing in the water on a hot Arizona day. We noticed something a bit out of the ordinary from the people next to us. They were sitting out in the water with a couple of pans and it looked to us like they were panning for gold right next to where we were fishing...&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Naturally, being ever interested in the shiny yellow metal, I went right over and started talking to them about what they were doing. As I got there they showed me a little gold nugget they had just pulled out of the mud a couple minutes before... I had always had an interest in finding gold but never really knew where to look. My stepson Damian on the other hand had never really seen gold before but when he heard that it was worth money, potentially a lot of money, he got the 'gold fever' something fierce!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/textfree_43263257378937002335f33a.jpg</p>\n<p>(The family looking for gold)</p>\n<p>From that day on, every day he would ask me if we could go look for some gold. \"Can we go find some gold today dad, where do you think we would find gold dad, and can I keep whatever gold I find?\" were questions I would hear pretty much on a daily basis. However, with the new baby, getting out to look for gold was not an easy endeavor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That would all change as one Friday afternoon we were finally able to escape and get back out to that spot where we saw that couple gold panning. We packed up my old gold panning stuff and we were ready to head out to the spot. We even went out to the store and bought a little gold panning kit for Damian and also a mini sluice box for dad because I just knew with more technology I could really bring home the gold!</p>\n<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/textfree_340415371637805629815524.jpg</p>\n<p>(That's me, being a true 49er)</p>\n<p>However, the trip turned into a giant disappointment with nothing to show for our hours of hard work but some microscopic particles that may have been gold or may have just been mica. In fact the only thing we brought home that day were some painful sunburns! We went home feeling utterly defeated and I hung up my sluice and gold pans deciding I was not going to be doing that again for a while as I couldn't handle the disappointment. Damian on the other hand, would not be defeated so easily...</p>\n<p>From that day forward everywhere he went he would look in the sand and dirt and pick up rocks in search for that elusive metal. It was nice to see him have such ambition. However, the questions I got would tend to wear on me after a while. From the school playground, to the park, to the wash by our house, he would collect rocks and bring them to me and ask... \"hey dad, is this gold?\" Every time I would look at these rocks (that were not even close to resembling gold by the way) and I would have to shake my head and say... \"no son, that is not gold.\"</p>\n<p>This process went on for months... everywhere we went... \"hey dad, is this gold?\"</p>\n<p>It got to the point where I almost didn't even really look at the rocks he was showing me because I knew it wouldn't be gold... I would just sigh and say the same thing every time... \"no son, that is not gold.\"</p>\n<p>However, a couple weeks ago, that would all change...</p>\n<p>It was a Sunday afternoon and we were finishing up our grocery shopping at the local Walmart. Damian ran off to the decorative rock piles with the trees that they have in a lot of parking lots. This is what he always did when we were out in public... He started going through a pile of rocks not far from our car like he usually does as we loaded the groceries in the car. As we were finishing up he came up to me holding a rock and asked his usual question...\"hey dad, is this gold?\"</p>\n<p>I didn't even really look at the rock, I just did a passing glance and said... \"no....\" However, something that sparkled caught my eye as I was turning away. I paused, and turned back to give the rock another look. Saying, \"hold on there for one second, let me see that rock a little closer Damian...\" I examined it and right there in the middle of the rock, there appeared to be a tiny streak of gold running right through the middle of it! I couldn't believe it... did Damian really just find gold in the Walmart parking lot?!</p>\n<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/20160910_09422101543.jpg</p>\n<p>(If you look very closely the lower left hand corner has a tiny gold streak)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After pausing for several seconds, I turned back to him and gave him the answer he had been longing to hear for months now... \"yes son, I believe that is gold!\"</p>\n<p>All he could say was... \"I knew it! I get to keep all the money from this dad!\"</p>\n<p>Ever since that day, anytime Damian asks me \"hey dad, is this gold\", I always take him seriously and examine every rock he hands me very closely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, there you have it... gold can be found anywhere... even in a Walmart parking lot! :)</p>\n<p>https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/textfree_651883524027574376032f9e.jpg</p>\n<p>(That's us, including the baby!)</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed my story!</p>\n<p>This has been an original story by @jrcornel.</p>\n<p>Image Source for first picture:</p>\n<p>1. http://www.ebay.com/bhp/gold-nugget</p>\n<p>Follow: @jrcornel</p>\n</html>",

If we move to a new place for work or some other venture, it's especially hard because we might not know anybody in the surrounding area. Quite often it is going to require a bit of effort in order to find new people with common interests who are open to forming a new friendship with others.\n\n<center>http://thesocialman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/friendswhiletraveling.gif  </center>\n\nWhen I was in school it was a lot easier, because I would be a part of different clubs or sports and could easily meet people that way. Sometimes I would meet them in class as well, working on various class assignments or projects. It felt a lot easier to make friends as a child than it does now. \n\n<center> https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/64/c5/48/64c548b6dd357fd031a051bc1dc959cc.jpg </center>\n\nWork is also another place to meet new friends and I have been fortunate enough to meet some great ones there as well that have turned into long-lasting connections. But how else can we go about meeting friends as adults? \n\nThere are a variety of different ways that you can do it, and here I'm going to share some of my personal favorites. \n\n<center> https://lovelace-media.imgix.net/uploads/169/19d07d50-f68b-0132-f12f-0ed54733f8f5.gif? </center> \n<center> <b>Volunteering</b> is a great way to get out there and not only do something nice for others but meet some cool people as well. Chances are that through your volunteer work you will make some really deep and meaningful relationships with caring people. </center> \n\n<center> https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/kp_aerobics2.gif </center> \n<center> Joining some sort of club or organization, whether it be a book club at the local library, a hockey team, or a swim exercise class, there are always a number of different things going on in the community, it's just about taking the time to find something for yourself. </center>\n\n\n<center> http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Step-Brothers-Did-we-just-become-best-friends.gif </center>\n<center> Niche-search: look for chat rooms, youtube channels, facebook pages, or group meet-ups that are specific to a certain niche that you are interested in. Do you like Mechanics? Boxing? Cars? There are a number of different chat rooms and places that you can meet people who will specifically bond with you over something that you are really passionate about and that could be the starting point to a great new friendship. </center>\n\n<center> https://blog.elasticgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/swipe-right.gif </center>\n\nAside from these ideas, there are also a number of emerging apps that are seeking to meet this need for people as well. Many introduce people in the same way that the Tinder app would and other similar services. Hey! VINA, Yonder, Skout, and Meetup, are just some of the popular apps that are being used by people to help make new connections with people in their own community and around the world.  And steemit, as with the other platforms, has the same opportunity to foster the opportunity where you can meet some really inspiring and creative individuals.",

    "body": "A friend and I met for lunch at a local taco shack near the city's greenbelt, where he planned to take his mountain bike out for a cruise along the trails. As it was a pleasant Autumn afternoon and there was nothing keeping me, I decided to take a walk through the beautiful sun-soaked woods myself.\n\nAfter tacos we made our way to the trail head together, at which point he asked in what direction I was headed. \n\n\"I don't know,\" was my reply. \n\nMounting his trusty carbon-fiber steed he took off and soon disappeared around a bend leaving me there alone. \n\nLooking down the trail to my left, then up the trail to my right \u2026 then back to the left again, as if awaiting some unseen force to propel me in either direction, but feeling no particular pull, I finally rested my gaze upon an opening in the trees just in front of where I stood, and so up the middle I went. \n\nStepping through the woods about forty or so feet, I came out onto a bone-dry creek bed which I then followed. Poking along haphazardly up the old creek bed for ten minutes or more, I looked up and was suddenly bewildered by what I saw. \n\nNot far off in the distance I could just begin to make out what seemed to resemble stalagmites \u2013 a group of twisted, spindling, rocky spires that reminded me of something I might have once seen in Southeastern Utah or the caverns of New Mexico. \n\nAs I drew closer it was impossible to suppress a smile. \n\nHere is what I found ....\n\n![image 1](https://s15.postimg.io/b2gnkfe63/img1.jpg)\n\n![image 2](https://s22.postimg.io/6142bastt/img2.jpg)\n\n![image 3](https://s11.postimg.io/qda6yn9oz/img3.jpg)\n\n![image 4](https://s18.postimg.io/rfx58pcg9/img4_6.jpg)\n\n![image 5](https://s13.postimg.io/b1llkt7nr/img5.jpg)\n\n![image 6](https://s22.postimg.io/o27tdn7cx/img8_9.jpg)\n\n![image 7](https://s3.postimg.io/6xel5spoj/img10_7.jpg)\n\n![image 8](https://s22.postimg.io/xfn5dopr5/img11_12.jpg)\n\nAfter some time I sat down to meditate among the stones. \n\nSitting there in the silence, I at some point found myself moved to envision in my mind's eye a sense of all humanity. This vision encompassed the many individual thoughts, feelings, attitudes and actions of mankind, including those that we tend to regard as undesirable: all of the deceitful, violent, selfish, cunning, calculating hurt and pain that we are capable of inflicting upon others as well as upon ourselves \u2013 those things that we wish to reform within ourselves but about which we often harbor some form of condemnation and contempt for in others.\n\nEventually entering into this vision of the totality of mankind was an opening up to a sense of love, understanding and acceptance for all of it, including our many so called 'detractions'.  \n\nJust as I was coming to this point, from the periphery, now drawing my attention away, was a growing awareness of one such member of humanity incarnate. Indeed, as I looked up, there was a trail runner breaking stride fifty feet or so away from where I sat on my haunches.\n\nHaving clearly run for some distance along the creek bed, he now stood hands on his knees drawing several heavy breaths, before continuing in my direction at a walk. \n\nI tracked him unflinchingly as he passed, anticipating a silent exchange of glances, if nothing else, but he did not so much as motion to look in my direction. \n\nAs he moved along, I let my eyes come to a close once more, attempting to re-calibrate with the vision. Yet, now conscious of his presence somewhere off in the near distance among the rocky spires, my focus waned. \n\nOpening my eyes again I spotted a leg through the cairns. Why him? Why now? Why had this stranger been allowed to intrude upon me at the seeming apex of my meditation? Was this some sort of malevolent ploy orchestrated by the devil himself to prevent me from attaining the enlightened state I was surely just about to reach had I not been interrupted? Damn you again, Universe, for not abetting my spiritual awakening! Though not explicit in such words, this was the essence of my mental reaction to the situation at hand.\n\nThen the following realization took hold of me: Here before me was a perfect, outward, real-world example, illustrating for me the very thing I had been trying to capture in my meditation. Whereas I had begun opening to embrace, accept, and feel compassion toward the 'negative' within my meditative mind-state, I was now all too readily rejecting and mentally discarding what I perceived to be a negative outcome unfolding for me in actual experiential reality. I was condemning rather then embracing my own experience. \n\nWith that, I again closed my eyes, intent on letting go of the idea that this runner's presence had somehow arrived as an inconvenience, and instead attempted to welcome it as a practical instantiation of the very thing I had been meditating on.\n\nWithin no time at all I was stirred again by the sound of footsteps. The same man having circled round, now walked by me again, heading back in the direction he had come, only this time he acknowledged me with a nod and a wave as he passed. I nodded back silently. As he opened up into a run back down the creek bed, I stood up and watched until he was just a trace in the distance.\n\nAfter a few minutes I started back down the creek myself, when another thought struck me, causing me to ponder the implications of what had just transpired still further. The trail runner had appeared to be around my age, roughly the same height, with a very similar build. We both had light hair with a scruffy unshaven face, and had both been shirtless. The more I considered it, our resemblance was uncanny. \n\nHad the Universe, rather than forsaking me, merely been presenting me with a mirror?\n\n*(The preceding account was first written in Autumn of 2013, shortly after it occurred.

Can't lose those few extra pounds?\n\n**Need some more excuses to add to your list?**\n\nWithout further adieu, the **ULTIMATE** list of **VALID EXCUSES**. \n\nNo. Really.\n\nI have a full time job, three kids, two dogs, and a cat.. I don't have enough time to work on my idea.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have student debt to pay off, there is **no way** I can afford to work on my business on the side.\n\nI'm **not qualified** for the job that I know I'm perfect for... Might as well not even **try.**\n\nThe last guy I asked out **rejected me.**. At least Netflix **doesn't judge.**\n\nMy parents were **both overweight**, which means I'll always struggle with my own body issues.\n\nI didn't go to a great college, so there's no way I'll be hired to work at an awesome startup.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI was born skinny, no workout plan will help me gain some muscle.\n\nI tried my last business idea and it **failed miserably..** now my parents won't even talk to me.\n\nAll my friends grew up never having to worry about money.. **they don't understand what it's like to be me.**\n\nMy family and friends are *so negative..* and there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nI'll work on my project at later this year. It will be better timing.\n\nI made a few huge mistakes early on in my career, and now I'm destined for mediocrity.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI want to learn how to draw, but art supplies are **too expensive.**\n\nI really want to learn Spanish, but learning a new language **as an adult is impossible.**\n\nI would really like to start a podcast, but **I don't know how.**\n\nI bought a course on entrepreneurship, but it was a scam so I didn't follow through.\n\nI'm an introvert, so I can't go learn how to \"network.\"\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nI don't have enough time! All the successful people I know have money to hire a virtual assistant.\n\nMy job sucks, so I'm super tired after work -- Madden is **my time to unwind.**\n\nI had a really bad childhood, **everyone is out to get me.**\n\nI have **really** bad anxiety.. I can't possibly ask for a raise.\n\nI did everything I could! I don't know why I didn't get promoted.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEveryone seems to take advantage of me. Why should I even try?\n\nI hosted an event at college on how to manage personal finances. No one showed up.\n\nMy first few jobs **were all failures**. Will I ever find the job that is right for me?\n\nI want to work on my online business, but Twitter and FB keep sending me notifications.\n\nI can't afford to eat healthy, McDonalds is on my way home.\n\nMy mum, father, brother, sister, say I should be a lawyer... I guess that means that's my destiny.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI wrote a blog post, but no one read it. I must be a terrible writer.\n\nNo one understands my situation... **I'm stuck and always will be.**\n\nI want to make money online, but everyone who does is a scammer!\n\nI've been wanting to change careers for years now, but I'm 40 and it's far too late for that.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI read a few books in highschool and hated it. No book appeals to me.\n\nI'm so afraid of coming up short! **What will my family and friends think?**\n\nI raised money for my last startup and it failed... Now investors won't return my calls.\n\nI had to settle for a job that I hate, because my wife and children are depending on me.\n\nI am **TERRIBLE** at math! I'll never be able to learn calculus.\n\nAll my friends went to an amazing school. I'm destined to be a loser.\n\nThere's so much I want to learn! But I don't have the time or money to do so.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy last girlfriend broke up with me out of the blue... I'll **never** be able to find love like that again.\n\nMy entire family loves political party x.. but I disagree with them! We'll never be able to get along.\n\nMy friend said I was wasting my talents.. **I just want to give up.**\n\nI'm in a shitty relationship, and I don't know what to do.\n\nI was a jerk to my friend, and now they won't talk to me.\n\nMy super successful coworker has always been good with people! I'll never be able to be like him.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm always shy in group situations.. no matter what I try.. I can never be good with people.\n\nMy friend has a fitbit! **I'm so jealous**! No wonder she is able to stay in such good shape.\n\nMy uncle lied to me when I was young! I can't trust anyone anymore!\n\nI don't understand FB. **My online business is doomed.**\n\nMy teacher said I would never be a good writer. I became a lawyer instead.\n\nI tried a new exercise routine for 3 days and it didn't work.\n\nEating healthy is so boring!\n----------------------------\n\nI don't **know how** to start a website!!\n\nMy significant other thinks my business idea is stupid. I guess I should stay at my job.\n\nI have **ADD..** there's no way I can ever focus long enough to succeed.\n\n.....\n.........\n.....\n.........\n\nValid? Yes.\n-----------\n\nWe've all listened to the abundance of excuses living inside our head.\n\nBut your health, happiness, and future success depends on your ability to ignore.\n\nWhat's your excuse? Good. \n\nYou're human.\n\nNow go and make things happen anyway.\n\n**P.S** Would love to hear what 'excuses' are holding you back?

    "body": "<center>https://i.imgsafe.org/82405681e4.jpeg</center>\n\nMany millenia ago, certain people started to work with herbs and other plants, healing the bodies and souls of their tribespeople. Over time, they learnt how to use certain plants to form a connection with some deep part of their unconscious, tapping into wisdom of unknown origin, which would, slowly but surely, affect the fate of humanity. Some shamans claim they contact spirits, and by using psychedelic drugs, they can come into contact with the divine.\n\nIn this episode, Kurt had a chance to catch up with Luis Fernando Mises at Anarchapulco 2016 and discuss shamanism. We discussed the contrast between San Pedro/huachuma and ayahuasca \u2013 how huachuma is like a patient grandfather who is ready to work with you at your own pace, and how ayahuasca is like a stern granddmother; how huachuma gave Luis a master\u2019s degree on economic policy, how the roles of shaman, consultant and gun-owner are more harmonious than it might seem at first, and how psychedelic medicine can have a domino or fractal effect through many lives.\n\n<a href=\"http://theparadiseparadox.com/audio/paradise-paradox-ep-95-luis-fernando-mises-shamans-guns.mp3\">To download the audio, right click and press \"save as\"</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jJO-NwsjWw\n\n\n\n*This is a repost from our site http://www.theparadiseparadox.com.

    "body": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/493806472564711424/rMuSXKi6.png\nTwo things:\n\n1) 24/7 trading.  You can buy shoes at 3 a.m. but you can't buy Exxon stock.  The reason that you can't is because right now when you buy Exxon stock from a broker, you aren't really buying Exxon stock.  When you buy Exxon stock, the broker issues you an IOU, and then in a few days, the brokers transfer stocks with each other.  The trouble with this system is that it means that you have to close down the stock market each day, and you have to keep it shut because, when the brokers compare notes, they often find something off, and people spend hours dealing with it.\n\n2) Where's my money?  True story.  I ask for a bank transfer in HK.  I actually type in the number for an invalid account.  Because it is between two banks, I have to make three or four bank visits, and ask them where's my money.  They have to look through their records, and it turns out that each bank says that the other banks has my money.  The fact that the two banks literally have their headquarters right next to each other, means that I only had to spend two weeks to figure out what is going on.  Now if one of the banks was outside of HK, I'd been totally stuffed.\n\nNow with blockchain, all of the transfers go into a distributed database.  With my key, I should be able to see all of the transfers I made, and if one goes wrong, I know where my money is.\n\nThis stuff can be costly.  Once you reduce the cost of settlement so that you can send small payments cross-border, then a lot of opportunities open up.  I'm trying to do USD 1000 shipments of coffee.  The reason that you don't have special branded coffee is purely a payments issue.",

Traditionally, \"SoFloridians\" have always had a chip on their shoulder since LeBron left. It's not like they didn't appreciate LeBron, it's just the way he announced his return to Cleveland. He left with out alerting anyone in the higher ups, leaving The Heat to fend for themselves during the off season, causing a significant drop off in our winning culture. Not only that, the taunting that most franchises will go through after Cleveland fans realize they're the best team in the NBA. There's going to come a time where the memories that LeBron left in South Florida will be overshadowed by his new found success in Cleveland. And that is what causes the resentment.",

    "body": "I saw this post and thought it would be useful with a BitAsset twist ;)\n\nJames Turk:  \u201cIt is getting very ugly for the big banks, Eric. The price of many bank shares are in clear downtrends, particularly the European banks. Many of them are being swamped by unsecured loans that will never be repaid and will therefore have to be written-off as total losses.\n\nThe country in worst shape is probably Italy. The banks there have non-performing loans \u2013 which are those that are impaired and not meeting the original borrowing terms \u2013 that in the aggregate dwarf total bank equity. Even worse, non-performing loans in Italian banks have risen again over the past year from 17% to 18%. It is hard to imagine that 18% of all loans within that country are non-performing, but the Italian economy is in trouble as evidenced by its 11.7% unemployment rate. \n\nSpain, Portugal and others have growing bad debt problems in their banks too, and we have to recognize that these bad debts may be insurmountable. That\u2019s because the bad debts in many banks are larger than the bank\u2019s capital, so they can\u2019t take these losses because it would wipe out their book equity. In other words, many banks are insolvent because the difference between the true value of their assets and the value at which they are reported on bank balance sheets is in the aggregate greater than the shareholder equity of the bank. \n\nSo we have to remember not to be misled just because these banks are still open for business. Even though many of them are insolvent, they remain liquid because of the largesse of the European Central Bank, which bends over backwards to keep insolvent banks from failing because of the alternative choices when they do fail.\n\nEither the government bails out the bank, or depositors do like occurred in Cyprus and Greece with bail-ins and other schemes that cause losses to depositors or prevent them from withdrawing their money. But the situation in the US is not much better, as we can see on the following chart.\n\n![gold](https://s5.postimg.org/s5evkat53/delinquency.jpg)\n\nThis chart from the Federal Reserve shows the year-over-year rate of change of delinquent loans owed to US banks. The chart was just  recently updated through January 2016, meaning it lags by 6 months and therefore does not capture the weak economic conditions so far this year, which I expect have worsened delinquencies. \n\nWhen the rate of change crosses zero, it has been a good indicator of recessions. Importantly, it is now signaling that a recession is beginning, providing more evidence that supports the same conclusion from a variety of other economic indicators. The upshot is that counterparty risk is likely to gain increasing attention in the months ahead. In fact, I think that a rush to safety has already begun.\n\nWe clearly see the rush to safety in alternatives outside of the banking system such as the rising price of Bitcoin, which rose another 4% last week and has nearly doubled in price from its January low. And the rising price of gold and silver this year indicates that the precious metals are benefiting too. \n\nBut here\u2019s the scary part: If these early indicators about bank problems are correct, and I believe that they are, we face another 2008-type crisis for the simple reason that debts today are much bigger and therefore more unmanageable than they were eight years ago. Huge debt loads and bank non-performing loans in a slowing economy promise a train wreck.\"\n\nEDIT : http://kingworldnews.com/the-world-is-headed-for-another-terrifying-collapse-and-heres-the-scary-part/\n\nMy own opinion is fortunately we know how to get to the other side of the valley and make some wealth - buy some BitGold/BitSilver. After all, they are the ultimate safe havens and with BitShares there is NO COUNTERPARTY RISK.",

    "body": "Really interesting extract from an article I found written by Vinny Lingham. It raises some pretty compelling points on why Bitcoin represents an investment opportunity, even now after a 60% in the last 2 months. Be interested to hear others thoughts...\n\nThe coming short squeeze\n\nThe most important driver of the pending price surge, in my opinion, is going to be what I term as the \"mother&*!er of all short squeezes\".\n\nA short squeeze is basically what happens when people that are short selling an asset discover that the price has risen and they need to buy (cover) to ensure they do not make further losses.\n\nIn the bitcoin world, this happens under a number of scenarios.\n\nTraders and speculators who have taken a view that the bitcoin price will go lower could borrow coins via exchanges and sell those coins into the market, waiting for the price to drop to buy them back cheaper, repay the exchange and make a profit.\n\nMiners would normally want to lock in profits through \"hedging\", because they produce enough coins per day that they are able to pay out of their future production. However, halving day is approaching.\n\nHalving day is the day that a certain block number is reached and the rewards per block are cut in half (to 12.5 BTC per block, from the current 25 BTC). This is expected to take place in early July of this year.\n\nThis poses a problem for miners if they are trying to lock in their profits right now by borrowing and selling coins, which they intend to repay after halving day. Unless they have spare bitcoins lying around, they will be forced to buy coins on the open market if they cannot produce enough through their mining operations.\n\nIt\u2019s the same as selling crops in the futures market and then being hit by a storm that wipes out half of your fields. The only way, technically, that this doesn\u2019t happen, is if the price doubles on halving day (it won\u2019t).\n\nBecause bitcoin trades at the margin (which means that only a percentage of the total coins issued are traded), there is less liquidity and extreme changes like a 50% drop in the rewards per block will have a more marked impact on the price than one would expect, triggering a short squeeze.\n\nOne would argue that the market has already factored this in, but it hasn\u2019t. The reason is that the hash rate will fluctuate very rapidly over the halving day period, and that is going to cause a lot of volatility for miners and traders. Also, the true deflationary rate of bitcoin is not known, as I will now explain.\n\nReal inflation vs nominal inflation\n\nBitcoin was created as \"deflationary\" currency. The total supply is 21m units and it will never be changed. There are about 15.5m BTC in circulation and about 3,600 new coins minted per day, so roughly 100,000/coins per month, which amounts to nominal inflation (relative to actual coins issued) of around 8% per year.\n\nThis will arguably drop to 4% after halving day. Or will it?\n\nIf we assume that 4m BTC will not move anytime soon, then the active circulation of bitcoin is closer to 12m coins (based upon coins in issue today). Assuming that we are minting 100,000 bitcoins per month, then real inflation is at 10%, not 8%. So, if halving day takes effect, then real inflation drops to around 5%/year.\n\nBased upon research by John Ratcliff, I\u2019d like to construct a new view of the real inflation rate of bitcoin. For various reasons, it appears that 25% of bitcoins are not in active circulation (lost, cold storage, Satoshi, etc). This is even if we assume Craig Wright is Satoshi (which would mean his coins won\u2019t move until 2020). All numbers are rounded.\n\nIn 2014, bitcoin nominal inflation was 10.3% and real inflation was 15.1%\nIn 2015, bitcoin nominal inflation was 9.3% and real inflation was 10.1%\nIn 2016, bitcoin inflation will be 6.4% and real inflation will be 8.7%\nIn 2017, bitcoin inflation will be 4% and real inflation will be 5.3%.\nInflation in bitcoin has an interestingly different application than inflation in the real world, in that prices aren\u2019t going up because governments are printing money. Prices are going up because of scarcity (supply/demand).\n\nIf you note that real \"inflation\" is dropping nearly two-thirds in around just three years, it means that for the current volume of bitcoin buying to be satisfied, bitcoin will need to find a new, and higher equilibrium point and clearing price.\n\nI don\u2019t think these calculations have been adequately factored into the market price.\n\nComing arms race\n\nThe realization that bitcoin is a strategic global asset will trigger an \"arms race\".\n\nCurrently, the market cap of bitcoin ($7bn) is simply too small to facilitate a large buy of bitcoins from any governmental organization. If bitcoin started to surge globally, it could become of strategic interest to a government, and therefore other governments. I believe this would trigger something akin to a digital commodity race.\n\nImagine if China started buying up large amounts of bitcoin \u2013 would the rest of the world governments stand idly by and watch? I don\u2019t think so \u2013 so my prediction here is that by 2017, governments will become the largest buyers of bitcoin, pushing the price up to new highs.\n\nIt\u2019s always easy to make outlandish predictions. My goal for this post was to outline what I think the tailwinds are behind bitcoin.\n\nI don\u2019t know if the price is going to $1,000 or $10,000 \u2013 but I do know that it is going up. If I was forced to predict, I would say that it would hit $1000+ in 2016 and $3000+ in 2017.\n\n(http://www.coindesk.com/2016%E2%80%8A-brought-bitcoin-awakening/)",

    "body": "Blockchain tech is just a solution to the Byzantine General's Problem.  It's utility is that it allows people who don't trust each other to nonetheless reach consensus on the state of the network/ledger.  But, it doesn't prohibit people who do trust each other from acting in a coordinated way (that is, colluding) to either protect the viability of the network itself or to attack it.  When done to attack the network, such collusion is commonly called a \"51% attack\".  When done to support it, it's commonly called a \"fork\".  \n\nFor me, the question is which threatens the future viability of the blockchain most--reversing a series of transactions that resulted from a hacker exploiting an obvious coding error, thereby prohibiting a thief from stealing lots of coins or 2) insisting that \"code is law\" and that no transaction, not even those that result from obvious and extremely costly mistakes, should ever be reversed.\n\nI argue that refusing to reverse via a fork, and thereby refusing to honor the original expectations of the DAO participants and developers, does the more damage to the network than forking would. If this particular exploit had been known with certainty to every DAO participant in advance, how many of them would have actually put money into the DAO?  Easy answer:  Few to none.  And, if such hidden exploits are likely to exist in the future and participants have absolutely no recourse, how many are likely to invest in the future?  Fewer.  Much fewer.  \n\nInsisting that \"code is law\" and refusing to correct via soft or hard forks what we now know was obviously a coding error is essentially to insist that every single smart contract in the future will serve as a \"trap for the unwary\", with the \"unwary\" being essentially anyone who can't read code for themselves (and even a large portion of those who can).  Note that taking this approach creates a perverse incentive for unethical smart contract developers to \"build in\" obfuscated backdoors that the developer himself/herself eventually intends to exploit.  \n\nEven if we assume naively that all developers will act in good faith, the fact is that virtually ALL software has SOME exploitable bugs, even audited software and even open source software.  Smart contracts are ultimately just software, software that cannot be edited, and every one of them that is sufficiently complex will likely be buggy.  \n\nIf the Ethereum community's position is going to be that there is never any recourse for buggy software because \"code is law\", even buggy code, then it's future growth and success relies upon expectations of the impossible:  That programmers will suddenly begin to consistently write complex code that is bug free, or that the market will suddenly get much, much better at knowing in advance which software is buggy and which is not.  Neither of these are likely absent major innovation.  \n\nIn short, my contention is that market participants will respect and value that the Ethereum community independently chose to prevent a thief from undermining every single DAO participant's original expectations to the thief's great advantage.  Reversing things via a fork will instill confidence in the system, leading to continued growth and investment.  Failing to remedy the situation will result in the opposite:  A permanent loss of confidence and decreased growth and investment.  \n\nDoes this mean that we will have a hard or soft fork every time we discover a bug in a smart contract?  Obviously that won't be possible once there are thousands or millions of smart contracts running.  And, in some cases, it will be much less clear whether or not the software in question was in fact \"buggy\" or instead functioning as intended.  Even so, just because the Ethereum community won't always be able to intervene to fix an error doesn't mean that it should not do so in this instance where the facts are clear, the error is obvious, and the amount at stake is large.  \n\nDisclosure:  I do hold some ether, but I'm not a participant in the DAO.",

    "body": "Hello innovators and pioneers of the new social media economy!  I'm so very thrilled to see where this journey will take us.  It reminds me of images and books I've read about the land rush back in 1889 as I find much equivalency to homesteading! Gone are the masters of property today such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc that have no peer in the decentralized economy.  Also, this takes us back to a time when government regulations weren't so much of a drag as it is today.  Fortunes can be made by good people with good intentions without the burden of complying with regulations that are for bad people with bad intentions.  Thank you steemit for giving the power and the economy back to the people.\n\nI like to keep my privacy, but I will say that I was first introduced to the bitcoin blockchain technology via Coursera!  Coursera still has a course, I believe, in startup engineering which used bitcoins as a means to measure how well your web app performed.  This was back in 2013, I think!   I'm also a systems and software engineer for DoD and, interestingly enough, DARPA is funding a small business topic on utilizing the blockchain technology as the basis for implementing a peer-to-peer, DDoS resistant, private, and robust messaging framework for operators, command nets, and consumers of their intelligence.\n\nPeace out, k-rapper.",

In the post Ethereum world, nobody will have their funds stolen, and no criminals will be able to hold people for ransom, because the chain will be forked to thwart these criminals.  \n\nBitcoin is for criminals and Ethereum is for the \"good guys\"\n\nThe masses have spoken, and they vote to trade freedom for security.  You my friend are a minority.  \n\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/dao-attack-good-thing-ethereum/\n\nSo now tell me that this was not a publicity stunt to show the masses that:\n\nEtherum - \"Crypto is not just for criminals anymore\"\n\nJust when you thought Ethereum had peaked, they hit another home run with main stream consumer resonation.\n\nVitalik is a crypto superhero saving the world from criminals and thieves.\n\nWhat happened? 3,641,694 ETH where splitted out of theDAO. The attacker found a loophole in the regular splitDAO function so that they could reuse the same DAO tokens over and over again.\n\nHow did the attack worked exactly? The attacker managed to combine 2 exploits. The first exploit was to call the split DAO function recursively. That means the first regular call would trigger a second (irregular) call of the function and the second call would trigger another call and so on. The following calls are done in a state before the balance of the attacker is set back to 0. This allowed the attacker to split 20 times (have to look up the exact number) per transaction. He could not do more - otherwise the transactions would have gotten too big and eventually would have reached the block limite. This attack would already have been painful. However - what made it really painful is that the attacked managed to replicate this attack from the same two addresses with the same tokens over and over again (roughly 250 times from 2 addresses each). So the attacker found a second exploit that allowed to split without destroying the tokens in the main DAO. They managed to transfer the tokens away before they get sent to address 0x0 and only after this they are sent back) The combination of both attacks multiplied the effect. Attack one on its one would have been very capital intensive (you need to bring up 1/20 of the stolen amount upfront) - the attack two would have taken a long time.\n\nIs the remaining Ether in theDAO safe? No - it is most likely that this exploit could have been used to drain all Ether out of theDAO. The attacker stopped draining ETH when Vitalik wrote his first blog response that mentioned the plan for soft and hard forks. We can assume that the hacker stopped for strategic reasons to make a community decision for a fork less likely. However - the attacked voted in other fork proposals as well - for more details have a look here\n\nSince the Ether of the attacker is in a copy of a theDAO contract - can the ETH be stolen the same way? This would have been possible if at least one honest actor would have voted for this split. Since the attacker is most likely the only shareholder and the curator of this DAO the same attack can not be done.\n\nHow would the proposed soft fork work? The soft fork would be an immediate action to mainly buy time. Miners could modify the Ethereum client that it would ignore all transactions where as a result of the transaction ETH is deducted from an address that has the code of theDAO. Miners would also ignore blocks of other miners that would include such a transaction. If the majority of miners decides to do so it would be impossible for everyone to move ETH from every \"theDAO\" version. So it would affect the main \"theDAO\" and all the splits - including the regular and the malicious one.\n\nIs a software version of ETH with this modification already available? Yes - Parity and GETH have released proper versions.\n\nWhat needs to happen to activate the soft fork? It would require a coordinated effort of the majority of the miners. Coordination is important otherwise a miner would likely lose his ETH. If you for example solo mine you should NOT switch to the patched version unless you are convinced that a majority of the miners did because otherwise your software will ignore the longest chain since it would see it as invalid.\n\nMiners need to communicate with each other and define a block in the future that should be used to switch over to the new version. As soon as the majority accepts a new version it is dangerous for a miner not to use the new version.\n\nIf the soft fork succeeds - what is a path forward The softfork will most likely only a temporary solution. If it would be the final solution it would mean that basically all ETH on all theDAO contracts is frozen forever. There are two more likely paths forward. First a hard fork - with a hard fork literally everything is possible - we will discuss likely paths later. The second path from the freez softfork is to allow only certain kind of transactions. Under the assumption that no more ETH is drained from theDAO a more specific softfork 2 could allow every DTH to receive its share of the remaining ETH.\n\nIf the soft fork does not succeed - what will happen? A very big mess of attacks and counter attacks. White and black heat hacker will start exploiting this bug. However since every split will be public everyone can join every split. The right strategy would be to split you tokens up to have a very small number of tokens in every split. So if someone is performing the attack others will also have shares in the splitted DAO - that will allow them later to perform this attack again in the newDAO after the creation period is over. This could result in endless splitting. It would create incentives to spam the network or to bribe miners to censor transactions. In addition it is very likely that other bugs will be found and exploited. If we would end up in this stage it is very likely that all non technical DTH would lose everything.\n\nWhat are the arguments for and against the soft fork? The biggest argument for the soft fork is the prevention of the huge mess that would occur without one. There are philosophical arguments against it - essentially the softfork would be a form of censorship. However - most affected by this censorship would highly welcome it (all DAO token holder) expect the attacker. However - there is a small group of people also affected by this who not might want it - everyone who spitted in a regular manner and is confident that no one of the other shareholder in this splitted DAO will atack them (e.g. because they are the only one).\n\nWhen and how is a hard fork possible? A hard fork would require longer discussion and consensus finding. To execute a hard fork miners are less important. More important are exchanges and key player in the ecosystem. (Ethereum foundation, core developers, leading companies in the ecosystem). If all those players agree to a hard fork even a small minority of miners would be enough but more importantly - miners would join under those conditions almost for sure. With a hard fork in principal ALL rule changes are possible. New Ether can be created, legit ETH can be destroyed and so on. However - chances are 0 that the community would agree on such a fork. So we can narrow the expected range down. On the upper end (on a scale of ETH value per DAO-token) would be a complete reversion of all illegitimate splits. That would mean that DAO tokens could again be redeemable of 0.01ETH each. The lower end would be the ratio of ETH that is left in theDAO contract - currently 0.006857 ETH (without extra balance) . However - for such a solution no hard fork would be required, it could be done with a soft fork. So a consensus solution might also be that only parts are restored. Others could be either destroyed or be used for some form of common good (e.g. Ethereum foundation, decentralized fund that will subsidize future security audits, )\n\nAdditional information:\n\nWhat is the difference between a hard and a soft fork. A soft fork means that a state/block that used to to be valid is not valid any more in the new version. In this case a state that would result in spending ETH from any contract with the code of theDAO would be considered invalid. A hard fork makes a state valid that was not valid before. The big advantage of a soft fork is that only miners need to update their software. Although eventually everyone should - if everyone waits for enough confirmations they will only accept states that are valid under the new rules. In a hard fork however everyone (consumers, exchanges, ...) need to update their software. Otherwise they are in danger of losing their ETH and other assets on Ethereum. For this reason the period between agreement on the fork and execution of the fork should be much bigger than it can be in a soft fork.\n\nCan we track down the identity of the attacker. This is an open question. There is a decent likelihood that the attack was not planned long in advance so the hacker might have done mistakes as using addresses that are linkable to their identity. Here is an excellent overview of the accounts involved. The hacker was careful and used only ETH from a transaction from shapeshift.\n\nWhen did the hacker started to plan this attack? The two key contracts that held the tokens and had the logic in that allowed the recursive split where created 2 days before the attack. So at least two days. However - a split was initiated 7 days before the attack. However - it is not yet 100% clear if the attacker and the initiator of that split are the same. It likely but not necessary. The attacker could have used any split proposal. But even if the attacker was the initiator of the split it does not mean that they were preparing the attack already back then. Under the assumption that theDAO was bug free there has been an arbitrage opportunity of buying DAO tokens for less than 0.01ETH and converting them to 0.01ETH with a split.\n\nIf the soft fork is implemented - can I still transfer DAO Tokens? Yes - every transaction that does not affect the ETH balance of a contract with the code of theDAO is still possible.",

    "body": "Truth In Fiction: Introducing Myself\n\nMy name is Extropia and I am a digital person. That means I am a fictional character existing only in online social networks and worlds.\n\nIf we consider various meanings of the word \u2018fictional\u2019, this simple description reveals hidden complexities. Going all futuristic for a moment, a neuroengineer called Gerald Loeb used the words \u2018lies\u2019 and \u2018fiction\u2019 to distinguish between two kinds of prediction. A \u2018lie\u2019 refers to any hypothetical technology that can never be made because known physical laws show it to be impossible. On the other hand, \u2018fiction\u2019 refers to any hypothetical technology that is not ruled out by known physical laws. Its current non-existence must therefore be attributed to lack of skill (we have not yet worked out how to build it) or lack of will (nobody is motivated enough to really try). But, in principle, it could exist.\n\nHere is a futuristic scenario that, so far as I know, is fictional rather than a lie. A person meets up with her friend\u2019s avatar and the two of them converse, reminiscing over the past experiences they have shared; dreaming up plans for tomorrow. What the person doesn\u2019t know is that the human behind her friend\u2019s avatar has died. But that person lived in an age when the storage space available to the individual was so vast, a lifetime of memories and experiences could be archived. Networked computers and sensors became so ubiquitous, discrete and intuitive to use that tweeting and blogging evolved into \u2018life logging\u2019. In other words, the capturing of everything a person sees, hears, reads, does and even the emotional states associated with each passing moment (the latter inferred from various physiological states monitored by discrete sensors worn on the body). Finally, the future Facebooks and Googles of the world developed datamining tools that trawl lifelogs and compile sophisticated models of everyone\u2019s mind. After all, the better their services get at knowing who you are and what you are like, the better they get at targeting advertisement at you.\n\nThese trends\u2013ubiquitous networks of sensors and computers, virtually limitless storage capacity, lifelogging and sophisticated models of people\u2019s behaviour\u2013have resulted in a kind of life after death. Avatars that learn how to impersonate their human and do it so convincingly even best friends are convinced the avatar really is who it claims to be.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t like to guess when or if such a scenario will become reality, but I can see that it raises all kinds of questions. What would \u2018only existing online\u2019 mean in a world where networks are so pervasive nowhere is offline? Could future Facebooks offer services so attractive that people willingly allow their digital memories to be scrutinised in this way? If a robot makes you believe it is your friend is that due to the sheer sophistication of tomorrow\u2019s AI, or is it because online social networks have simplified and degraded interpersonal relationships to the point where even relatively dumb \u2018bots are considered good companions?\n\nI want to leave the future now and cast our gaze in the opposite direction. Looking into the past, we come to understand that \u2018fiction\u2019 is not just escapist fantasy but a vital aspect of being human. I have already blogged at length about this in an essay called \u2018The Storytelling Animal\u2019 (http://extropiadasilva.wordpress.com/2010/06/12/the-storytelling-animal/). What I hoped to show in that essay is the way fiction is woven into the very fabric of our daily lives, online and offline. I think we need to bear this in mind and be wary of an overly simplistic dualist attitude toward fantasy/reality, fact/fiction when talking about online social networks/ worlds and the interactions developed therein. We might imagine that we can neatly compartmentalize \u2018fantasy\u2019 from \u2018reality\u2019 and that we can distinguish the truth from what is fake- particularly when the object of scrutiny is ourselves. But, really, the boundaries are not fixed and well-defined but indistinct and fluid, intermingling with one another. This is not a bad thing per se, but a vital evolutionary adaptation for creatures living in complex social groups (again, I explore this at length in \u2018Storytelling Animal\u2019). We bring these evolved traits online with us and the power of the networks amplify them, ramping up the complexity with which fantasy is mashed-up with reality.\n\nWhat is responsible for this mashup? Thanks to much research by neuroscientists and psychologists, the answer seems pretty clear. The reality we experience is not actually objective reality but rather a kind of fiction. In other words, the reality you perceive is generated by the mind, its best guess of what\u2019s out there based on the brain\u2019s interpretation of sensory data. Philosophers have long asked whether people experience reality in the same way and the answer from modern science is \u2018no, not exactly\u2019. I myself know this from personal experience. I have chaired many discussion groups in Second Life and, having listened to many people\u2019s beliefs on all manner of subjects, it is evident to me that we do not all live in quite the same reality. So if the world is a kind of fiction generated by the mind, what is real? For most people, this is determined not by cold scientific logic but rather a general consensus. Reality, it seems, is any hallucination shared by enough people. After all, if you believe something, and all those around you share this belief, who is to say it does not exist?\n\nWhich brings the focus back to me. Although I claim to be fictional, for the most part the people I meet in Second Life don\u2019t behave as though I do not exist. On the contrary, they behave toward me as though I were an actual person. If my primary imagines I exist, and others participating in the online social networks and worlds I inhabit behave as though they believe I exist, perhaps I am not fictional at all? We should not just ask \u2018what is real and what is not?\u2019 but also \u2018what is true and what is true in here?\u2019 Here being online spaces. Is it true to say I don\u2019t exist in physical space? For now, yes. Is it true to say I don\u2019t exist online? Perhaps not.\n\nSo many questions. What does it all mean? My name is Extropia and seeking the answers to questions such as these is the reason I was dreamed up.",

    "body": "The US and Canada breach affects customers who bought before April 28, 2016.\n\n\n\nIf you bought an Acer device from the company's store in the last year, there's a chance that your credit card info was hijacked. The Taiwan-based company informed California's attorney general that attackers made off with the \"name, address, card number, expiration date and three-digit security codes\" of users between May 12, 2015 and April 28, 2016. It sent form letters to the 34,500 affected customers, all of whom are in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe theft isn't particularly large and no social security numbers were taken. However, it's one of the few we've seen involving a major PC company's online store. Acer hasn't yet revealed how it happened, but such breaches are usually a result of employees opening infected email, not any fancy hacking. While the breach was still ongoing, Acer recently held an event to reveal its latest laptops and desktop computers. If you bought something from its stores soon after, you may want to ensure that your credentials weren't stolen.\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/2016/06/20/acer-admits-hackers-stole-up-to-34-000-customer-credit-cards/\n\nhttps://s.aolcdn.com/dims5/amp:caca0cc30723bdab729a3c173fa095ba4a9d1d7f/q:100/?url=http%3A%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fe38963564f676e4efeadf9bbc7cdc166%2F203972827%2Facer-hack-credit-cards-2016-06-20-03.jpg",

    "body": "![alt text](https://s31.postimg.org/up1njnikb/doll5.jpg)\n\n## Most parents I know don't let their kids paint on their own toys. Not only do I let her, I encourage her to do so.\n\n![alt text](https://s31.postimg.org/hkwhw1syj/doll1.jpg)\n\n![alt text](https://s32.postimg.org/f0tlxsddx/doll2.jpg)\n\n# Not only do I let my kid paint on her toys, I let her draw on her walls, too. Shocking, I know.\n\n![alt text](https://s32.postimg.org/a95c8yfc5/wall.jpg)\n\n_this is actually my room, but in the future, I'm turning it into an art room, so it doesn't matter how much stuff ends up being on the walls. It will be an amazing room by the time I die._\n\nTo some, this may seem to go too far, but I have very specific reasons I let her paint on her walls and toys. There's a kind of sterility that exists in the modern age, and which greatly annoys and scares me.\n\n## CULTIVATION OF CREATIVITY\n\nI feel that the current educational system doesn't encourage kids to be authentically creative. Instead, I feel that too much emphasis is placed on conformity. So, in order to counteract those messages which she will no doubt be picking up, I encourage her to express herself without judgment at home.\n\n## OVERCOMPENSATION FOR MY OWN REPRESSED CREATIVITY\n\nParents are mostly guilty of overcompensating for things that they lacked in their own childhood. I'm definitely guilty of this. I wasn't raised to value my own innate creativity, as far as visual arts, dreams go. Although my parents were involved in music, it was classical that was stressed. I had the idea I could be anything I wanted, but for some reason, either due to shyness or cultural programming, I wasn't encouraged to be using my imagination for a career. \n\n## JOY AND FREEDOM\n\nJoy that comes from creating stuff is undervalued in our society. Joy comes about when we are free to express ourselves without fear of judgment. I suffered from judgment for a long time with regard to my creativity. I think it harms our growth and potential. Plus, the joy one feels as he/she is watching the contents of his/her imagination spill out, is one of the best things in life.\n\n## THE FUTURE OF JOBS\n\nWhen my daughter is an adult, much of the world will be automated. I believe that the ability to change and adapt will be even more important than it is today. The ability to innovate, change direction and come up with new ideas by mixing 2 existing ones will be essential to survival. I've noticed this even in my own life. It was after college that the internet came out, and I've been actively transforming myself, growing with technology and new tools. I encourage my daughter to invest in self-expression and the cultivation of her imagination, no matter if that involves science, art, music, whatever. In the future, I think we will be able to be more human, meaning, we will be more self-aware, exploratory and possibly more free to be ourselves. We were not made to sit in a cubicle. That just seems like an insane idea that needs to die. The ability to quickly adapt is essential to survival and I feel that being in touch with innate creativity is a way towards that future.\n\n![alt text](https://s32.postimg.org/7f19stzvp/Enlight1_32_copy_2.jpg)\n_letting my kid paint her own face with high-quality face paints since age 2_",

I have a couple of questions about voting returns, and I can\u2019t seem to find an article that already explains it. I am new to the site and have very little Steem Power, and want to know how that affects the returns on my voting. \n\nI found this article by @abit that explains some aspects of voting returns: https://steemit.com/steem/@abit/steem-post-voting-strategy--follow-others-votes-or-not\n\nThe article gives a few examples of voting returns, such as: \n\n> \u201cif after you voted, the reward shows on a post became $100 from $0, and Ned up-voted after you, the final reward become ~$2500 (which is 50*50), distribution the reward is: author $1250, you $350, Ned $900\u201d\n\nHowever, my question is:\n**If after I voted, the reward shows on a post became $1 from $0, and if Ned up-voted after me, the final reward became $2500, what would the distribution of the reward be?**\n\nI guess my real question is:\n**Do I need to be buying Steem and powering it up to Steem Power in order to see a real return on my voting curation?**\n\n*Thank you in advance for your help!

    "body": "https://nxtforum.org/core-development-announcements/%28ann%29-ardor-or-nxt-2-0-a-scalable-child-chain-platform/?all\n\n \"The Nxt core dev team is letting anyone get into the blockchain space with a new child chain platform, Ardor, which will incorporate the technologies proven for years by the Nxt 1.0 cryptocurrency and blockchain. Soon, anyone will be able to create their own solutions using the blockchain technology with the Ardor child chains.\n\nNxt is undergoing a dramatic evolution. Research by the Nxt team has led to Ardor, a platform that uses child chains and incorporates all of Nxt's latest blockchain innovations while being backed by the core developers of Nxt. Ardor is more than just about money: It's about making a blockchain platform that is open to everyone, from single users all the way up to FinTech startups and governments, and one where anyone can create their own child chain and interact with the whole blockchain ecosystem. That means anyone, anywhere, will be able to utilize blockchain services with relative ease.\n\nWe can't give away too much until the final features of Ardor are tested repeatedly.\n\nBut, here are a few of the features coming with the new Ardor release:\n\n1. Offering Blockchain as a Service - Ardor will open blockchain development to organizations and individuals across the world. The high barriers to getting started with blockchain are about to vanish.\n\n2. Manageable Blockchain Size - Ardor will solve the problem of scalability by separating transactions and data that do not affect security from those that do, and moving all of those that don't affect security onto child chains. The Ardor team will create the first child chain to house many Nxt 1.0 tools as well as future features. This small size also comes with short transaction times so processes need only a fraction of time compared to Bitcoin to execute functions.\n\n3. A Decentralized Asset Exchange - Building off of the Asset Exchange on Nxt, Ardor will enable the ability to trade assets on any child chain for any of the child chain tokens. This allows child chains to interact with each other and opens up numerous opportunities for collaboration as well as allow cross chain asset trading, a long-requested feature within the Nxt ecosystem.\n\n4. Decentralized Voting and Governance Systems - Ardor will be at the core of decentralized consensus in the future. Secure and anonymous voting will be an available feature on all child chains as it is on the Nxt platform.\n\n5. Phased Transactions - Users can set multiple conditions before a transaction is executed, such as a minimum number of votes and a set amount of time. Like Nxt, Ardor will use Smart Transactions. With this, users will only need to submit the parameters necessary for the transaction and the ID of the functionality they want to use. The transaction process is also completely decentralized. No centralized server, service, or application, like Ethereum\u2019s Oracle, is needed.\n\n\u201cRather than providing smart contracts, NXT is focused on implementing the important use cases and functions directly into the core of both Nxt and Ardor. This approach has proven to be scalable and secure and will become more so when Ardor is released\u201d \u2013 Riker\n\nThese are a few of the things Ardor will give you and the cryptocurrency community. As development continues and testing is finalized, you'll get a detailed analysis of each of the new tools, as well as the core features built into Ardor. We'll also reveal, step-by-step, a list of our partners and what they're doing with our technology.\n\nThis is all possible because of new developments within the Nxt community. Decision-making and planning is becoming more professionalized. The community and team structure are adjusting to the new demands while the Nxt and Ardor technology remains entirely open source. Ardor is more than a cryptocurrency - it's a blockchain platform specifically designed to let anyone build decentralized tools with the latest innovations in blockchain technology.\n\nHow to get Ardor\n\nYou'll be able to participate in Ardor right away. As Ardor continues testing and development, Nxt 1.9 will be released. With Nxt 1.9, you'll get your first chance to own a piece of Ardor. All those who hold an amount of NXT will also get a piece of Ardor. Snapshots will start be taken on an hourly basis, starting on July 14th to October 12th. Then, your total NXT will be averaged, and you'll receive that amount in Ardor tokens on October 12th, which will be freely tradeable up until the Ardor system launches.\n\nAt block 1,000,000 on October 12th, 2016, snapshotting will stop, and you'll be allowed to trade your Ardor tokens in NXT 1.9 in preparation for the launch of the Ardor blockchain.\n\nAfter Ardor has launched, Nxt 1.0 will remain active and supported. Nxt 1.0 is the giant on which Ardor is built and it will remain running as a core component of the Nxt eco-system, functioning as a complete blockchain solution in its own right, as well as assisting in the development and refinement of the Ardor blockchain platform.\n\nThere'll be a lot more news in the weeks and months to come. Ardor aims to be a powerful platform for users and businesses alike by building on the technology pioneered by Bitcoin and Nxt. If you would like to be a part of it, acquire NXT now and get your stake in Ardor!\n\nAbout\n\nArdor is brought to you by the core development team from Nxt. After years of building and testing the Nxt platform, the team is going to involve the public even more. As the first Blockchain 2.0 platform, the community has continually improved Nxt and now looks forward to release Ardor for companies, organizations, and of course, users.\"\n\nnxt is still alive and kicking guys! For those who don't know 50% of the tokens will go to the nxt development. The one thing that has hampered nxt the most is its lack of funding, this will mitigate that to a great degree. I think nxt has a lot going for it now, it is way more professional now than a year ago. Dameleon has actually quit his normal job and is working full time with crypto. This will also solve the scaling problem, I think nxt has a bright future, they are different from both lisk and ethereum, they have their own niche.\n\nFor those interested in finding  out more about this check out:\nhttps://nxtforum.org/core-development-announcements/announcing-nxt-2-0-roadmap/?topicseen",

    "body": "Published on www.amyoes.com\n\nI\u2019ve always loved nature\u2014ever since I was a little girl. My nature walks were my time to daydream and collect little treasures along the way. I\u2019d often come home with pockets full of acorns, mulch, flowers I picked off neighbors\u2019 lawns, pebbles, and a bit of dirt. My fantasies were vivid, and the world felt so alive around me\u2014the trees had faces, the sun had a song, and even as a kid I knew I was living in a world of miracles. Nature was how I continually rediscovered myself\u2014every day, the world felt new.\n\n\nI grew up happy, healthy and confident with who I was. But my life took an unexpected turn when, two weeks after I turned 18, I fell into a coma for months due to a sudden blood clot. When I awoke, I was told I no longer had a stomach and couldn\u2019t eat or drink. It was not known when (or if) I would ever again.\nWaking in the unfamiliar world of the ICU (full of beeping machines, nurses and IV pumps) was earth-shattering. Discovering medical appliances all over my immobile and foreign body, feeling as though I woke up as someone else, and not knowing when I would leave this alternate universe was frightening and overwhelming. But what I want to share with you are the blessings that came from starting anew.\nA detour in life is easier to travel...\nAs I became more and more alert, I slowly rediscovered the world that I had been away from for so long, and it felt like every smell, every sight and every interaction was being experienced for the first time. As my family sat by my bedside, I noticed things about their demeanor and our dynamics that I had never taken time to see before. I realized that the quiet, intimate moments can speak volumes. In a way, being snatched from the hustle and bustle of everyday life provided an opportunity to connect more deeply with my loved ones. We had been given the precious gifts of quiet time and no distractions. Things I hadn\u2019t noticed before\u2014my mother\u2019s smile, a friend\u2019s laughter, the love and support all around me\u2014now evoked feelings of profound gratitude.\nThe beauty of a near-death experience is you realize the things that matter in life. However, I wouldn\u2019t say that falling into a coma is necessary to realize this! Every day is an opportunity to remember the things that make us feel grateful. Once my hands were able to write again, I would make a list from A to Z of what I was grateful for. Even on some of my hardest days, I found that by the time I got to \u201cZ\u201d, there were at least a few things to smile at and be thankful for.\nSoon my alphabetical list turned from \u201cAlmost walked, Better heart rate, Coughed less\u201d to \u201cAwesome walk outside, Best afternoon ever, Cheerful spirits today.\u201d It was amazing to see each day slowly improve and to feel myself gradually claiming ownership of my world again. Bit by bit, I started to feel myself materialize back into the girl I knew before my coma, but equipped with a deeper wisdom and a vivacious new desire to discover the world.\n\nAs my spirits lifted, I got better from the inside out, hungrier than ever to re-experience the world. Eventually, I didn\u2019t need to be plugged into as many machines, so my family started taking me on high-speed ride, racing through the halls of Columbia Hospital in my wheelchair. We\u2019d explore all of the hidden nooks and crannies of every floor, though I\u2019m sure we weren\u2019t supposed to be in half the places we went to! Finally, one day, we found a beautiful spot outside where I got to enjoy my first breath of fresh air in months. I remember seeing the sunset for the first time since the coma\u2026 I felt like a child being born all over again. Even the mundane became glorious\u2014seeing people having lunch outside, the roaring of traffic, birds overhead\u2014and the more I saw the more I wanted to be a part of it.\n\nNow, here I am, a decade later. I\u2019m healthy, grateful, and part of the world again. It\u2019s the wonderful world I knew before as a nature-loving, happy-go-lucky teen, yet there\u2019s a little spark that lies behind every sunset, every friend, and every routine experience. I admit that I still get caught up in the rush of everyday life, when it\u2019s easy to take things for granted, but I always try to remember what it felt like to breathe in that sunset in that rusty old wheelchair. When I do, the overwhelming sense of gratitude floods my senses again.\nHow would you live your days as if each experience was being felt for the first time?\nStart today\u2026\nSubscribe for updates on Amy\u2019s upcoming book, \u201cMy Beautiful Detour.\u201d Oestreicher is a PTSD peer-to-peer specialist, artist, author, speaker for RAINN, writer for The Huffington Post, award-winning health advocate, actress and playwright, eagerly sharing the lessons learned from trauma through her writing, performance, art and speaking.

I'm not sure how to say it in Spanish.\u201d\n\n-I'm not sure what you mean.-\n\n\u201cHave you ever felt a feeling of connectedness with anything, a feeling of intense elation, or a feeling that everything is exactly how it should be?\u201d\n\n-Yes, many times.-\n\n\u201cWhen Maslow first wrote about these experiences, he thought that only self-actualised people had them. Later, he realised that almost everybody has these experiences. It's just that self-actualised people have more of them, more frequently.\n\n\u201cImagine if there were a substance that could give you that kind of experience, and even help you realise how you can have that class of experience over and over again.\u201d\n\n-But that would only be taking on the trappings of self-actualisation...-\n\n\u201cYou think so? Consider this. you're a psychologist now. But one day you weren't, and you had the idea of becoming a psychologist. Were you wearing the trappings of being a psychologist?\u201d\n\n-No, because that was an idea which lead me to change something in my life.-\n\n\u201cExactly; exactly my point. You had the idea first, and that lead you to be what you became. Likewise, a person can have a peak experience, realising the power of empathy, or that all beings in the universe deserve respect, and having had that vision, he can begin to make it a reality. That is, he can become self-actualised. Now, that substance exists, and it's called 'ayahuasca'.\u201d",

This made me very cynical about marketing and copywriting - my old career.\n\nSo I refused new projects, and felt ill every time I started something. It's made me temporarily poorer, but I'd rather have integrity than be constantly compromising myself.\n\nAnyway - enough of my emotional baggage. Let me tell you about this book.\n\nReinventing organizations is a study about how businesses and organizations will evolve and adapt in the future.\n\nIt first clarifies the various stages of organizational evolution. Ranging from:\nhttps://s32.postimg.org/geg51khid/laloux_diagram.png\n\n\n**Red- Fearful, power-driven groups (e.g. inner-city housing projects, drug cartels, powerful chiefs)\nAmber - Formal hierachies, no questioning (e.g. schools, government agencies, the Church)\nOrange - Very competitive, aim to achieve profit and growth at all costs, command and control, goal-led (e.g. big corporations)\nGreen - With a traditional pyramid structure but a focus on culture and employee motivation (e.g. Ben and Jerry's, Southwest Airlines)**\n\nBut what's exciting for me is the final category.\n**Teal - Self-management replaces hierarchical pyramids.** The organization is seen as a living entity with own creative potential and purpose. People are seen as assets and it's about matching their purposes and life journey to those of the organisation. Everyone is trusted to take responsibility, do what they feel needs to be done and it trusts that the collective intelligence of everyone makes better decisions than top-down decision making. People are encouraged to be authentic, bring their whole selves to work and be spiritually full.\n\n**Now, what does that mean to you?**\n\nThe future belongs to self-organising clusters of people who are brought together by a joint sense of purpose. Influence accumulates to those who benefit others the most. Furthermore, without all the pressures, politics and wasted energy of \"looking good\", and with all the benefits of shared information, open structures and alignment with purposes - we free up the energy to make amazing things.\n\nSteemit is definitely a Teal Organization... probably beyond that stage.\n\n**What excites me a lot about Steem is the great variety of opinions, the \"wholeness\" that people bring of themselves, the validation of belonging in open-minded group, and the fact that \"Steem power\" accumulates to those who bring the most value.**\n\nThe book is a quite long and a bit dry in places. However, you can a read a summary of all it's main points here:\nhttp://www.reinventingorganizations.com/uploads/2/1/9/8/21988088/140305_laloux_reinventing_organizations.pdf\n\nIf you would like to read the original,  here is the  link\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Organizations-Creating-Inspired-Consciousness/dp/2960133501\n\nIf you're here you probably understand most of these points intuitively. But I'd say it's well worth the time to read it. The insight that stuck me most was that many of the things I'd clashed with -  school, office politics, authority figures, bosses - were not bad people. It's just we were operating from different paradigms and they didn't have the worldview and open mindedness to see where I was coming from.\n\nBlah blah blah. Enjoy the book and let me know what you think.",

You can see by the source of the file that it is just a normal picture hosted at tinyimg.io; it is actually a 1x1 pixel png file with a white background. it exhibits all the characteristics of a tracking pixel with out the nasty tracking.\n\n## Looks harmless, how does it track me?\nWith a traditional tracking pixel, it will be hosted on a web server which is monitoring it's HTTP logs and watching for anyone accessing that picture (these are uniquely generated for each email). generally this tracking pixel and associated logs/data will be accessible to the person paying for the service and presented in nice dash board for their viewing pleasure.\nThe log's generally contain information such as:\n* access time\n* amount of times accessed\n* ip address of user\n* user agent of browser/email client.\n\nTracking via email has a lot more appeal as you can derive the IP address of a targeted individual simply by sending them an email; with a browser based tracker pixel you are more likely to collect a lot of peoples details and not know which one was your actual target; one method to get around this is have an obscure page and use social engineering to get your target to browse to that page.\n\n## Tracking webpage views with rich data and nice dashboard\n[https://loggly.com](https://loggly.com/) provides a platform that allows you to track your page views with custom tracker pixels and provides a lot of in-depth data and a nice dashboard with charting to provide information relating the views over time. Loggly offers a paid service but also offer a trial sign up to allow you to experience the power of the platform at no cost.\n![](http://tinyimg.io/i/Wdb0g7e.png)\n\n## Prevention\nMost email clients these days do not download images within emails automatically; this helps considerably and should be enabled if it is an option on your client!. \nThis would mean that you would need to request your client to download the images before any chance of one of these little guys tracking your details.\nOn the other hand Internet browsers download images automatically and are much more vulnerable to being tracked with this technique. \nUse a VPN or proxy server to protect against browser based tracking.\nSome of Web security suites or components of AV/Firewall can assist in the detection and blocking of images with the dimensions 1x1 pixels. But this is not the only way to skin the cat any normal image file or element could be used to track this information and by blocking all these element's your webpages would look pretty boring.\n\n**Everywhere you go on the internet you leave a digital fingerprint, if you want to leave someone else's fingerprints, use a proxy server or VPN provider for your general browsing.**",

I dropped out of my masters degree in Physics, my bachelors degree was Electronics and Communication Engineering.\n\nI could have been a millionaire through bitcoin, in 2009 I downloaded the bitcoin miner and I ran it, but it took a lot of time to sync the blocks because of the low internet speed in India, I uninstalled the program because I didn't understand it fully, I was only 17 then and just bought a computer and ordered for an Ubuntu copy on a CD online and it was for free. It came from the Netherlands. That was my first exposure with Open Source and Free software, I was genuinely happy as a third world guy amazed that something I ordered from the internet came for free. \n!(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Ubuntu_9.04_Jaunty_Jackalope.png)\nAfter which I lost interest on Open Source, until 2013 when I had to do my final year project on Self \"Driving\" robot. I used ROS(Robot Operating System) and I was amazed again with genuine enthusiasm that there are people who go beyond just work and write programs for devices and release the code with Open Source licenses for others to use. Although my project was not much of a success because I was the only guy doing it,  in my team of 3. \nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/ROS_Groovy_logo.jpg\nI wrote some imperfect blog posts(on Open Source) with my imperfect English on Quora for about less than a year in 2014 and I got a good 250 followers but I deleted my account later as I failing my exams in Physics, I was so confused what I would be doing next. So, I just dropped out. Came back to India from Germany. \n\nAnd I was following a lot of cryptocurrencies, mainly Ethereum and other smart contract based, recently, my interest spiked and I invested in DAO tokens, for about $200(USD) and I had to sell them at a loss, I was so enthusiastic about DAO because I was working on a project which is based on Ethereum Computer and it had to fail and crash! \nhttp://donar.messe.de/exhibitor/cebit/2016/L958998/gallery-868x0-440941.jpg\nSo, here is my story.

I have a passion for many things and want to make the most of my time here.\n\nI love all things related to Disney History (especially Walt's biography).\n\nI have a huge passion for classical music and am learning the piano and take voice lessons.\n\nI love 1980s and 1990s TV - especially Friends, The Golden Girls, The Love Boat and Seinfeld. My new favorite TV Shows are Mozart in the Jungle, House of Cards, and (I confess...) The Bachelor(ette).\n\nMy favorite football teams are the Green Bay Packers and Wisconsin Badgers.\n\nMy favorite places to travel are London, Paris (even though I've only been there for 12 hours) Disney World/Land, California, Madison, WI, and anywhere tropical. I always have at least a couple trips planned out in my TripIt account.\n\nI also love wine.",

    "body": "The DAO \"Attack\" resulting in Ethereum's \"Fund Freeze\" proves to the big banks that Ethereum is now a serious competitor for their business just like Ripple did successfully last year:\n\nhttp://insidebitcoins.com/news/not-so-decentralized-ripple-freezes-1m-in-user-funds/31862\n\nRipple never left the Top 5 crypto list after publicly freezing user funds, and neither will Ethereum.  This is precisely because the Ethereum Foundation has publicly demonstrated effective control over its blockchain.  \n\nThis exact strategy has kept Ripple among the top cryptos, and proves that courting banks through demonstrable central control is an effective way to compete for real bank business weather Libertarians like us like it or not.\n\nhttps://ripple.com/insights/ripple-and-xrp-can-cut-banks-global-settlement-costs-up-to-60-percent/\n\nRight now, the Bitcoin-Libertarian crowd cannot see what is right in front of their nose.  \n\n***Ethereum doesn't want their business, because:***\n\n***The banker doesn\u2019t look at how she can make incremental improvements to today\u2019s systems with blockchain technology, but how she can position her bank to survive and thrive through the evolutionary change already underway.***\n\nEthereum has just thrown it's hat into the ring .\n\nThis is not jokes or FUD, but sound business strategy in play, combined with some insider trading, \"weak hand shaking out,\" and of course, \"accumulation,\" that can never be proven.  Congratulations Ethereum for re-positioning yourselves from the Bitcoin-Libertarian fringe into the lucrative mainstream big banking sector.\n\nIf you don't think I'm right, just wait until the next twist occurs:\n\nBanks start taking interest as the price reverses.  This is how  Wall Street takes a position in a company in the real world.  It's just that the crypto crowd is not used to seeing this close up.\n\nAfter the hard fork, everybody will think that the \"attacker\" had their 10% ETH stake taken away and will sing praises, while Goldman Sachs secretly built up a 20% stake!",

    "body": "picture of me in jotunheimen(mountains)  half a year ago\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/7dfb464e37.jpg\n\nHello, I am 26 years old and soon to be a student studying translation, I am planning on taking a three year degree in translation from English to Norwegian. I am very much familiar with the cryptoscene and I find this project very interesting. The project is interesting because I now can improve my writing skills while earning hopefully some money on the side :)! I hope there will soon come an opportunity to write in my native language, so hopefully more Norwegians join this community soon.\n\nI was born in Oslo and when I was around seven my family moved to the Hague in the Netherlands, we lived there for three years. At some point I actually spoke better English than Norwegian. My father worked at the Norwegian embassy as a diplomat while we were their.  I went to an international American school. This was a very stimulating time for me, I was meeting people from all over the world at school. \n\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/7e09584133.jpg\n(me with friends in 2009 on my first and only mushroom trip, it was a pleasant experience, now I don't do any psychedelics, not even weed. I drink rarely. I didn't overdo these substances in the past, I just don't have the need anymore.)\n\n\n\nAfter three years we moved back to Norway outside of Oslo. This was when a more difficult time of my life began, I was bullied pretty much every day from when I was 11-12 til I was 15-16. It got so difficult that I at one point even considered suicide. I got through this dark part of my life with a better understanding of what true suffering is, this has some advantages in that I might be able to understand some people better, but it has also left me with a pretty bleak look on life as well. \n\n(2010 drinking with coworkers in the mountains of Norway.)\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/7dfbc038d1.jpg\n\nAfter high school I left home and moved to go and study social science at the University on the west coast of Norway. University life was not something for me and I left and worked as a kindergarden worker and waiter. It has no always been as easy moving to a new place either. I struggle with trying to find a meaningful thing to do with my life. I have contemplated everything from becoming a psychologist to becoming a ship builder(building viking style clinker boats). The psychologist thing is interesting because I consider it very meaningful to help people, the only problem here is that it is very difficult to get into the program. The ship building thing is also interesting because this is a way of building boats that has a direct line to the viking age and outside of Scandinavia this tradition does not exist. Working with my hands and having my awareness in my body and not in my head I think is very important in this neurotic modern age. There is something special about building something tangible with ones hands, instead of creating cathedrals of knowledge or working with something very abstract. In general it is my opinion that in day to day interactions one should not be thinking, but being in the moment as much as possible. \n\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/7e0943743b.jpg\n\n\"Clinker built (also known as lapstrake)[1] is a method of boat building where the edges of hull planks overlap, called a \"land\" or \"landing.\" In craft of any size planks are also joined end to end into a strake. The technique developed in northern Europe and was successfully used by the Norsemen and typical for the Hanseatic cog. A contrasting method, where plank edges are butted smoothly seam to seam, is known as carvel construction.[2]\"(wikipedia)\n\nI ended up with translation because I love knowledge and how to transmit it. It is also easy to do this job freelance. I have a dream of living in an ecovillage one day, this job will make it possible for me to do just that.  It also gives me the freedom to try a lot of different professions. Most people in the modern world lack a sense of community or belonging, this is one of the major reasons why people suffer today. An ecovillage is one solution to this problem. I also believe that in the near future because of various resource scarcities it will be a big advantage to be as self-sufficient as possible. I have made a thread about this here if you want to read:\nhttp://forum.socialmatter.net/discussion/96/peak-oil#latest\n\nI view myself as a deep thinker and if I move to a very cheap place in the country I will not have to work all the time, this I see as a great advantage. Now I don't know where I will end up, but in a way I see it as a good thing that my life is open when it comes to different possibilities in the future.   Three years ago I also found a groundbreaking spiritual truth that completed changed my life, maybe I will write about this in a later blog.\n\n\n\nhttp://i.imgsafe.org/7e0977429c.jpg",

There are a lot of things that can provide inspiration \u2013 seeing other people accomplish great things, seeing other people overcome adversity, hearing inspirational quotes from great people, even the sheer beauty of nature can remind us just how lucky we are to be alive.\nhttp://www.keepinspiring.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/positive.jpg\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget what an amazing gift life really is. Our lives are nothing but a cosmic blink. Even our seemingly all-encompassing world is just tiny blue dot circling an average sized star spiraling around a galaxy of 200-400 billion stars, which itself is just one galaxy among billions more. Yet for one brief moment, we get to experience the wonders of existence, of consciousness.\n\nHaving a positive outlook on life is a crucial part of finding inspiration. In the paragraph above, did you feel inspired reading about the vastness of our universe and our unique place within it, or did you feel overwhelmed and depressed at the insignificance of it all?\n\nOur brains are wired to find things we\u2019re looking for \u2013 if you\u2019re always cynical or waiting for things to go wrong, then your life will reflect that. On the other hand, having a positive outlook on life will bring you joy and provide you with inspiration when you least expect it.\n\nOf course, there are times when it\u2019s difficult to feel cheery or positive \u2013 life can be difficult. If you\u2019re having trouble seeing the cup as half full instead of half empty, reading some positive quotes about life can help you snap out of your funk. Here are some inspirational life quotes to help you see the amazing potential that life has to offer.",

Where else does a room full of strangers jump, scream, and laugh their way through a terrifying big screen adventure? But with jump scares being served by the handful, it can be a bit dangerous for members of the audience who are longer in the tooth, or perhaps have heart conditions. Sadly, a moviegoer in India suffered a recent tragedy and passed away while watching James Wan's horror sequel The Conjuring 2.\n\nDNA India is reporting that a 65 year old man from Andrah Pradesh, India suffered a tragic heart attack while watching The Conjuring 2. This incident occurred Thursday night, in a movie theater in Tamil Nadu. The man reportedly complained of chest pain while he was in the theater, and suffered a heart attack during the movie itself. An ambulance was immediately called to assist the gentleman, but he unfortunately passed away before the help could arrive. While the victim's name was not released with the report, our hearts go out to his loved ones at this difficult time.\n\nThe Conjuring 2 definitely doesn't seem like a film that is friendly to those who have heart problems. The horror sequel is chock full of jump scares, and very effective ones at that. Director James Wan has an impressive ability to create heart racing suspense and create horrifying monsters to serve as antagonists. The Conjuring 2 has both The Nun and Crooked Man who serve to keep the audience full of anxiety and terror.\n\nIn fact, The Nun character was so terrifying that a spinoff film has been announced revolving around the monster. This is the second Conjuring spinoff to be ordered, after 2014's Annabelle. The creepy doll only had one scene in the original Conjuring, but it was scary enough to warrant a spinoff movie of its own. The Nun, on the other hand, was present throughout The Conjuring 2, so it makes more sense that the villain would get its own movie.\n\nhttp://img.cinemablend.com/quill/0/0/5/5/6/0/0055603a60291aa34259aa8b750efd266df57a6e.jpg\nIt is currently unclear if the man who passed away during The Conjuring 2 was aware of a preexisting heart issue before seeing the film. But signs point to he and whoever he went to the movie with being blindsided by the tragedy. But you can certainly tell from the promotional material that The Conjuring 2 was going to be absolutely terrifying, especially with how well received and scary the first film was.",

    "body": "https://i.imgsafe.org/7d795ab9cd.jpg\n\nI'm more and more astonished by the spreading attitude of promoting irresponsibility, not only in the Ethereum community but in other communities, including Steem. For me, the whole foundation of crypto-space lies on the principle of freedom. And with freedom comes responsibility - you cannot have the former without the latter. Thus giving up the requirement of responsibility undermines the entire notion of freedom. \n\nOne of the most evident manifestations of misallocated responsibility is a bailout. Some people say that the incoming hardfork in Ethereum is not a bailout, as no new ether will be created. Actually, it is. The essence of a bailout is that the cost of a reckless action of one person (or group) is transferred onto another person (or group) who did not have any involvement in the original action that caused a disaster. \n\nIn case of Ethereum it is a bailout in terms of lost reputation - to rescue the irresponsible DAO holders, the whole Ethereum platform is asked to compromise one of its biggest assets: the irreversibility of the blockchain. As a result, those Ethereum holders, who knew that the DAO is a risky business and did not participate in it, will participate in the collateral damage caused by the spill-out.\n\nHere are the undeniable facts:\n\n1. The DAO implemented poorly written code. Several days before the DAO collapsed, there were [numerous warnings](http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/05/27/dao-call-for-moratorium/) in the public domain indicating that the code has not been properly tested and reviewed. And there is an obvious explanation for this: the DAO was never about creating solid code for a decentralized investment fund. The real purpose was to raise funds for Slockit.\n\n2. It's been [clearly declared by Vitalik](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/736357210394112000) and  Ethereum Foundation that the DAO is a third-party project and as such it is not part of Ethereum. This was a clear signal that the DAO is on its own in terms of risk management.\n\n3. DAO's [terms & conditions](https://daohub.org/explainer.html) explicitly declared that the DAO code is the only binding description of the DAO contract. Nothing but the code matters, as it is clearly stated here: \n *Any and all explanatory terms or descriptions are merely offered for educational purposes and do not supercede or modify the express terms of The DAO\u2019s code set forth on the blockchain; to the extent you believe there to be any conflict or discrepancy between the descriptions offered here and the functionality of The DAO\u2019s code at 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413, **The DAO\u2019s code controls and sets forth all terms of The DAO Creation.***\n\n4. Furthermore, DAO's [terms & conditions](https://daohub.org/explainer.html) explicitly warned that there might be bugs in the code which might lead to a complete loss of both DAO tokens and ether backing it:\n*The DAO concept is both experimental in nature and unproven. There is a risk that, as an open source project, any contributor to The DAO\u2019s software could introduce weaknesses or bugs into the DAO software, **causing the loss of DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder\u2019s accounts**.*\n\n5. The DAO creators, even though they were aware of all the potential vulnerabilities, did not put a cap on the amount of ether the DAO could accept. As a result, the DAO become much bigger than initially expected, yet no extra precautions were taken.\n\nDespite all the above warning signs, many people decided to put more funds in the DAO than they could afford to lose. If this is not plain irresponsibility I don't know what is. \n\nFor me, this entire DAO affair bears a striking resemblance to events in 2008 and this terrible \"too big to fail\" principle. It's quite fascinating to watch how people declare their desire to get rid of the corporate world and they work so hard to bring about a change, yet when the time comes, they actually share the very mindset that perpetuates the current world order. \n\nIt's an old truth: history repeats itself. And every revolution devours its children.\n\nhttp://cdn.quotesgram.com/img/0/63/382159168-history-repeats-itself.jpg\n\n***Disclaimer**: I think that business-wise, if they want to keep the big money flowing in, Ethereum should probably go for the hardfork and bailout (though it might backfire - will any serious business want to be exposed to the morality judgement of the miners?). As a result, Ethereum will position itself as a project similar to Ripple, which strategically makes a lot of sense. However, this removes the deeper purpose that I personally enjoy in the crypto-space: the ability to make a significant and long-lasting change.*",

While the duo has done historically well by creating captivating and original animated feature films, it seems that their next few movies are all going to be sequels. While fans perhaps thought this move was a little too cheap and easy, it turns out that the actual product is still as enjoyable as the original films. The long-awaited sequel Finding Dory swam into theaters this weekend, and it's absolutely demolishing animated records, as well as its competition at the box office.\n\nThe Wrap is reporting that Finding Dory has had the biggest and most successful opening weekend of any animated feature. The sequel has made an impressive $136.2 million in order to achieve this victory. The previous title holder for this honor was Shrek the Third _which grossed a total of $121.6 million in its opening weekend. With a ten million dollar lead, it looks like Finding Dory has kicked that ogre's ass, and secured the victory for the House of Mouse. _Finding Dory's immense opening weekend success has also broke another record, with the nautical adventure now being the second-largest June opening weekend of all time.\n\nIn just a few short days Finding Dory has beaten major records and brought home a ton of money. In fact, Finding Dory's success made over 100 million more dollars than its biggest box office competitor, The Rock and Kevin Hart's comedy Central Intelligence. The buddy comedy brought home a respectable $34.5 million, which is nowhere near the animated feature, despite an impressive cast and aggressive marketing campaign.\n\nOn its way to the biggest animated feature opening record, Finding Dory also broke records with individual days that it showed. Both Thursday and Friday saw Finding Dory _taking the record for highest-grossing animated movie. Basically, _Finding Dory is a force that can't be stopped.\n\nWith the heaps of money that Finding Dory is bringing in for Disney, it's surprising that it took so long for the damn thing to finally be produced. Finding Nemo was released back in 2003, and enjoyed critical and financial success. The dialogue from the original is utterly quotable, and it helped cement Ellen DeGeneres' role as America's sweetheart. Fans have certainly been hoping that a sequel would be produced, but nobody thought it was be a whopping 13 years later.\n\nBut it all worked out in the end, as Finding Dory has been garnering positive reviews and clearly is a force to be reckoned with at the box office.\n\nSwim on over to theaters now to see Finding Dory attempt to find her family and herself in Disney/Pixar's newest success.",

But I'm just going to go for it.\n\nIn fact this is actually a very advanced element of perfectionism. I'm trying to say \"I'm imperfect and that's OK and normal\". When actually I'm just saying the words and don't really mean it at all. \n\nActually this is a just an attempt at trying to be liked. \n\nI bond well with people. I get to know people very quickly. I see things, I feel their energy, get under their skin and have an intuitive sense of who they are and what they need. \n\nMy problem is I don't trust myself, the universe, anyone else. No that's a lie. If I didn't trust anyone, or myself, or the universe I'd have killed myself on many previous occasions.\n\nBut I pull people close very quickly. And push them away just as quickly. What I like is people in a sweet-spot range. Close enough to be friendly with and somewhat intimate. But not too close that I'm obligated to do things with them or be too responsible for them.\n\nI think it's just a cynicism. Cynacism of love, relationships, happiness. I feel intimidated by all those thingsand would much rather be sulking around alone, than actually dare to open up to people 1-on-1. \n\nWhat it feels like deep down, is like I'm damaged goods. And like everyone has been out to get me. Like being chased. Writing that, I know that sounds loopy and stupid. But it's true.\n\nI've self-sabotaged a lot. I've not taken opportunities. I've shunned good interesting work opportunities, and friendships. I've broken many boys' hearts. \n\nI think it's like I don't trust things or people if it all comes too easily. Love that's unconditional feels unsafe. And if I enjoyed a job then WOAH I'd have to commit to it to a few years and then lose out an all kinds of new and varied experiences.\n\nSo I keep hermited and have sporadic contact with the outside world via Whatsapp, phone calls, Facebook and Steemit.\n\nAnd I write. I'm embarassed and a bit ashamed of it sometimes. But I have to do it because being face-to-face or on the phone with someone limits what I can say or express. I'm influenced by that energy and restrict myself to what I feel that person can hear.\n\nSo anyway, I'm a perfectionist hermit at the moment. But that's OK. I own it. And in time, once I feel more secure in myself that will change.",

For many of you newbies...did you know that there is a very active gardening section here on Steemit?  I've been here since early May and have been enjoying myself immensely!  \n\nWhile I've been gardening for over 20 years, and professionally gardening for the past 6 years, I have never blogged about it until now.  And yes, I am older than probably 99% of you out there..I am a very young 57!  \n\nSo, a techy friend in NY told me about this new site(blockchain, crypto...\"huh?\" I wondered) but I thought- could be a great place for a newbie blogger to get a start, so I jumped right in and signed up.  Shortly afterwards I started searching and realized there not only is another gardenlady on the web, but there is gardengal, gardenlady2, gardenstatelady, gardenwoman, and more!  Some of them are legit authors and speakers.  Well, I am **NONE** of those people!  My posts are pure me right here on steemit.    ALthough, I am wondering if there is a way to change the name to make it unique for the web?  I could be SteemGardener or gardenlady2.0, but I'm not sure the blockchain allows for this.  Oh well.\n\nIn the meantime,  here is a photo of my essentials when I go out for the day...Tool Holster, check.  Tools, check. Shoes, check.  Gloves, check.  Water bottle, check. Hat, check.  As you see, I've included my blue toes, and if you go to @gardenlady to this recent post https://steemit.com/gardening/@gardenlady/how-you-doin-no-how-you-doin-or-pot-re-dux  you'll see me with one of my pots...and the blue toes :-)\n\n**Note to Self:  NEXT** Post should explain about the right tools and the right gloves as you see pictured!",

It traded above $730 per bitcoin at the end of last week, levels not since February 2014.\n\nAccording to Chris Burniske, a blockchain analyst and products lead at investment manager ARK Invest, the cryptocurrency could be referred to as digital gold, as it shares many of the characteristics that makes the precious metal a great store of value.\n\n\"Bitcoin shares those same characteristics,\" Burniske told CNBC in a phone interview. \"[Both have an] extremely limited supply and a relatively inert state. Bitcoin and gold can both be used: for example, gold is used in electronic circuits and bitcoin is used as payment.\n\n[[Full story on cnbc.com]](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/20/all-that-glisters-is-bitcoin-now-as-safe-a-haven-as-gold.html?)",

    "body": "![](https://i.imgsafe.org/7d2e7ef1a0.jpg)\n\nI have difficulty remembering people's names.  Not their faces, not stuff about them, just their names.  I've had this difficulty for as long as I can remember and throughout my life, it's caused varying degrees of anxiety and gut-knotting horror.  \n\nThe trouble is that names are important.  They are the doorway to our identity and the gateway to familiarity.  There's a reason, that.....\n\n*\"sometimes you wanna go, where everybody knows your name\"* - [Gary Portnay, Cheers theme.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYcX534JqG4)\n\nWhen you encounter someone with whom you have any kind of history, confidently using their name and asking relevant questions about them helps to demonstrate their importance to you in a highly convincing manner.  It is the perfect way to begin to re-establish trust, makes it easier for you to pick up from where you left off and perhaps enables you to develop the relationship further.  All really positive stuff.\n\nSo you can imagine how uncomfortable it might be to fully comprehend the value and importance of remembering someone's name but generally finding a void where that information should be.\n\nTo put my problem into a proper context, I can remember my name fairly reliably, close family members, close friends and most of my work colleagues.  The irony is, these are all the people who know about my problem and would be most likely to forgive any indiscretions! \n\nI've googled my issue and it seems i have a type of ['anomic aphasia'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomic_aphasia). Great.  It's a condition.  I can't help it.  So do I mention that before or after they become aware of the fact that I don't know their name?  \n\n*\"Sorry, before we go any further, I'd just like to tell you that I have a condition and it means I can't remember your name.\"*\n\nOr\n\n*\"Yea, I'm sorry.  I've totally forgotten.  But it's because I've got anomic aphasia....\"*\n\nNo.  Neither is appealing.  So it's back to bluffing with liberal use of 'mate' or 'bud' and hoping that someone who does know the person's name swings by and uses it so I can transition rapidly to 'Dave.'  The trick then is to avoid blatant overuse of the rediscovered name which is easily done as waves of relief wash over you.\n\nMy close friends, who've been aware of my affliction for some time have, over the years, exacerbated my anxiety, the wretches.  For instance, there have been several occasions when we've been out and I've bumped into some people who's names I really should know.  I would be getting by, using my standard deployment of enthusiasm and flattery, when my \"friend\" would come over, insert themselves into the conversation, wait until they could see the sweat begin to pour down my forehead and then ask me if i'm going to introduce them properly.  I've wished so many time that the ground would open up and swallow me.\n\n*\"Um of course!  This is my friend Andy and these.....these are friends from university who I haven't seen for....how long's it been?\"*\n*\"Names?\"*\n*\"Sure sure.  Hold on a second, just got to take this.\"*\n\nThe old sudden, highly distracting phone call is handy, but not very convincing.....and quite rude when you think about it.\n\nThose kinds of incident are generally survivable because eventually you get the names, somehow, and can have a few laughs, reminisce and all's forgiven.  But where it gets really hairy is when you are at work and bringing together colleagues where you are responsible for the introductions.  Jeepers.  \n\nWhen I talk about the situations I've found myself in with my Fianc\u00e9, she always says.....\n\n*\"Why don't you just say, I'm sorry, i've forgotten your name.\"*\n\nI've asked myself the same thing.  It seems so easy.  It's nothing.  No-one cares really anyway.  The trouble is, everyone apart from me (I love it when people can't remember my name, love it) does care and understandably so.  Especially in a corporate environment where shallowness and pretense are all too common.  \n\nWhilst I've not found a truly effective means of mitigating the problem, I have improved the situation somewhat by insisting that my friends, family and colleagues always, without fail, introduce themselves straight away, whenever we encounter someone else.  They are to say.....\n\n*\"Hi, I'm xxxxxxx and your name is?\"*\n\nThis has helped quite a lot, but it's not perfect.  Sometimes it's willful maliciousness, sometimes absent-mindedness,  but the aggressive, \"get-the-names-into-the-open\" tactic occasionally fails.  I really would prefer it if we all just went crazy and decided that name tags were the bomb.  \n\n![](https://i.imgsafe.org/7d2e72b296.jpg)\n\nI accept that's just a pipe dream.",

Last week she had a new challenge for us.  \nShe bought this pop-up tent from Lidl to provide some protection for her son from the sun and wind.  It popped out of the bag as if by magic and was ready to use.  Seemed like quite a good idea but as we were making sandcastles, lounging in our fabulous tent and paddling in the sea, I was thinking - \"that's never going back in that little bag\". \nWell, home time arrived and we started packing up.  With the instructions ready, my friend tried to return the tent to it's original packaging.  The pictures were rather confusing and after a few attempts, I thought it was time to pass on the challenge.  My friend said she wouldn't ask for help but just leave it behind.  \"No way\" I thought, so I asked a nearby couple to help us.  \nOnce again, the fun continued with many attempts to shrink this big tent into it's little holder. I was hoping there was no-one around with a phone videoing the shenanigans. I am sure it took nearly 30 minutes to get the thing back into it's bag. It was rather amusing - you had to be there.  \nAll packed up, we eventually were able to head home but I told my friend she had to practice before our next beach outing.\n\nOne day, I received a whatsapp from her saying that she had taken it out and couldn't get it back in. LOL.  My husband is good with space and volumes so I knew it would be easy for him.  He looked at the pictures and had it done within 2 minutes - awesome!  I have now also found this video for future training.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qWw2OVsLrAg\n\nMy advice to you, if you buy one - practice at home before heading to the beach.  Have fun!",

    "body": "Scrolling down the list of content uploaded to Steemit I, like everyone I guess, notice that some posts are worth varying amounts of money, ranging from a few cents to over a thousand dollars. But is this really the case?\n\nIf it were really the case that content providers have earned that money, then I should have over $300 to go out and spend right now. But I do not think that is the case at all. Now, I am a total novice when it comes to cryptocurrency so it could be that I am making a big mistake, but from what I can tell from reading Steemit's white paper, watching its promotional video, and looking up info on this social network, what we are actually earning is 'Steem', which is something that has to be converted into spendable money via a process that seems very technical and intimidating to a noob like myself.\n\nAn analogy I would make here would be to  compare 'steem' to the chips you win in a casino. Those chips are certainly valuable in that they can be exchanged for real (as in, universally spendable) money. But unless and until they are exchanged for real money, they are not real money.\n\nI think the same thing applies to the 'money' my posts are generating. So why say my posts are earning $ when what they are really earning is 'steem' that only has the potential to become $ if I manage to figure out how carry out the conversion? \n\nShouldn't steemit drop the $ symbol and show how much steem contributers are being awarded instead? Maybe someone could design a symbol to represent 'steem' in that same way \u00a3 represents 'pounds'. Showing how much steem we are being rewarded, rather than how many dollars,  seems more honest to someone like myself who really does not have much of a clue when it comes to the processes by which the 'money' being earned is converted into spendable currency.",

Morris, Pennsylvania, Dungey surprisingly announced he was going to miss High Point and would be on the sidelines for the foreseeable future after discovering a fractured vertebra apparently suffered in an early-race crash during moto two in Colorado. Honda\u2019s Trey Canard\u2014fourth in the points standings prior to High Point\u2014also dropped out of the race prior to High Point after suffering an injury in a practice crash back home in Oklahoma during the break.

But why do so many people have B-12 deficiencies or blood serum levels at the lower limit, despite taking supplements and/or eating \"vitamin enriched\" foods? \n\nOne possible answer (besides them missing the \"intrinsic factor\" necessary for oral uptake) is that they may simply be taking the wrong kind of B-12. Now how could that be? In order to answer this question, we need to consider what vitamin B-12 actually is. \n\nThe term \"B-12\" actually refers to a whole group of chemical compounds, called cobalamins. This includes:\n\n* cyanocobalamin \n* hydroxocobalamin \n* adenosylcobalamin \n* methylcobalamin \n\nIn the production of food supplements or food additives, cyanocobalamin is used almost exclusively. This has the very simple reason, that cyanocobalamin is easiest to synthesize (especially in pure, crystalline form) and remains durable when exposed to air. Its cheap and widely available.\n\nThe crux of the story: Unlike the other compounds, cyanocobalamin does not occur in nature. It is an invention of the chemical industry. The molecule is similar to natural cobalamins, but not identical. \n\nIt is scientifically undisputed, that only adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin (also referred to as \"Coenzyme B-12\"), are biologically active, meaning they can be utilized by the human body. The commonly held view is though, that after ingestion in the form of tablets or food additives the body can convert cyanocobalamin into the \"useful\" coenzyme variants.\n\nBut does it really work that way? When injected subcutaneous or intravenous, cyanocobalamin definitely appears to be accepted by the body as a replacement. It has been used that way to treat the consequences of acute B-12 deficiency for decades after all, with clearly visible effects. The vast majority of people get their vitamins from food or supplements though. And when it comes to oral intake, the story might be a completely different one.\n\nOne of the special risk groups in terms of vitamin B-12 deficiency are vegans. Natural cobalamin is bacterial in origin. Sufficient quantities for humans are only found in animal foods. There are no plant sources of B-12 (although unwashed vegetables/salads do provide miniscule amounts due to the bacteria on their surface).\n\nThis fact is actually pretty well known among those groups, who for ethical reasons make the decision to ban animal products and food from their lives. Because a B-12 deficiency can have very serious consequences, especially in the form of neurodegenerative disorders and severe aberrations in children or adolescents, many of them have their blood serum levels monitored regularly. A measure which, by the way, should be highly recommended for everyone, not only because it provides us with important data on nutritional health and the efficiency of supplementation.\n\nNow, if you ask for experiences with cyanocobalamin within the self monitoring part of the vegan community, you get to hear the same story over and over again. Vegans are acutely aware that their blood values \u200b\u200bare, despite regular intake of \"fortified food\" or food supplements, at the bottom of the recommended range or even below it. And that even though sometimes daily dosages are taken, which exceed the necessary daily intake by as much as 40,000%!\n\nSignificant changes in blood serum levels and improvements of sometimes already recognizable symptoms of B-12 deficiency typically only seem to occur, when they either switch to injections, or change their supplements from those containing cyanocobalamin to methylcobalamin or adenosylcobalamin. It is the latter fact, supported by a host of anecdotal evidence (but sadly missing proper research yet), which is strongly pointing towards the possibility, that cyanocobalamin might be unsuitable for oral supplementation/therapy.\n\nSupplements based on adenosylcobalamin and especially methylcobalamin are only slightly more expensive, but can unfortunately be hard to find in local trade or in pharmacies (while cyanocobalamin is touted at every turn).\n\nThe impact of changing ones source of B-12, both in terms of physical feeling, as well as in the measurable influence on B-12 blood serum levels, is regularly reported with the utmost enthusiasm. In some cases, changing the oral intake of cyanocobalamin to methylcobalamin caused the measured blood level to raise by as much as five times, within one year.\n\nThese reports are, to a certain degree, supported by a study on elderly people, who where given food fortified with cyanocobalamin. The usual dosages (as they can also be found in breakfast cereals and the like) led to no observable change in blood chemistry. Only after taking comparatively astronomical amounts, slight raises of blood serum B-12 were reported, but not nearly comparable to the above-mentioned results with methylcobalamin. Unfortunately, the researchers in that study failed to compare cyanocobalamin to other variants.\n\nHowever, in this special case the lack of hard scientific evidence does not have to be problematic. It is pretty easy, to just watch ones own reaction in a self-experiment. Any general physician can help to monitor ones blood-serum level of B-12 as part of a regular health check-up. A regularly updated health diary may help to take an objective view on your personal energy level and general \"well beeing\".  According to the current state of science, it is also not possible to overdose on vitamin B-12 by taking it orally. \n\nMeaning there is absolutely no reason not to try and simply take methylcobalamin or adenosylcobalamin as a supplement and see what it does for you.",

    "body": "TWO WAYS OF RUNNING A BUSINESS\n\n(This essay is part four of the series 'How Jobs Destroyed Work')\n\nPATERNALISM\n\nSome businesses operate what might be called a paternalistic model. Under this model, a company\u2019s \u2018stakeholders\u2019- its owners, employees and customers- are all well taken care of. The pay is good, the hours are reasonable, many benefits are included (in 60s America, 40% of those workers who had major medical insurance were covered \u2018free\u2019, meaning that policy costs were fully paid by the company.) The thinking behind paternalism is that if all the stakeholders are well looked after, they will feel valued and will have a personal interest in ensuring the company remains viable.\n\nUnder paternalism, a job can achieve most if not all of the definitions of true work. An employee working for such a company may feel secure in their job, feel they are rewarded for what they do and that the work has real value. Midway through the last century, the expectation was that paternalism would only grow in strength. As Jeremy Rifkin explained:\n\n\u201cAn informal accommodation of sorts was reached which was to last, more or less intact, until the mid-1970s. Labour was to share, at least in part, in the gains in productivity- enjoying better wages and benefits- in return for the promise of labour peace and cooperation\u201d.\n\nLEAN AND MEAN\n\nBut, paternalism is not the only model a business can adopt. There is also what might be called the \u2018Lean and Mean\u2019 model. According to this way of running a business, the financial bottom line is of utmost importance, and anything that eats into it must be minimised or, ideally, eliminated. As far as the lean and mean model is concerned, the company\u2019s employees are not people to be looked after and rewarded for their loyalty. Rather, they are commodities to be exploited as ruthlessly as can be gotten away with. For example, General Electric\u2019s chief executive, Jack Welch, compared a company\u2019s employees to lemons, claiming there was \u2018unlimited juice\u2019 to be squeezed from them, so long as companies pursued a relentless campaign to achieve greater operating efficiencies. \n\nTHREE KINDS OF LABOUR\n\nUnder the lean and mean model, the owner classes do everything they can to reduce the bargaining power of the working classes, thereby putting them in the worst possible position when it comes to negotiating employment contracts. What this means is that everything you were lead to believe about employment as a child is threatened by such a model. As children, we are asked \u201cwhat do you want to be when you are older?\u201d. Becoming \u2018what you want to be\u2019 implies that you are going to find work that is a \u2018calling\u2019, Amy Wrzesniewski\u2019s term for the most satisfying work experience.  Like me, she believes we need more categories for employment than just \u2018work\u2019. She divides paid work into three kinds: Jobs, careers, and callings. A \u2018job\u2019 is employment in which people enjoy little discretion and find minimal engagement or meaning in what they do. People who have careers feel more engaged in their work, enjoy more discretion, and expect to advance, following a trajectory toward promotion, higher salary, and better work. They don\u2019t dislike their current job but equally they are neither content to remain there, nor expect to.\n\nFinally, we have \u2018callings\u2019. People who have found employment of this kind get the most satisfaction out of the work they are doing. They consider their occupation to be very important. They love doing it, so much so, in fact, that it becomes a vital part of their identity.\n\nAs a basic rule of thumb, I think it\u2019s fair to say that if we find work very satisfying it\u2019s because we are gifted at it. We all have certain special abilities, and if we can find employment that utilises those skills and helps them to flourish, then there is every opportunity to find great satisfaction in one\u2019s working life. \n\nSKILLS COST MONEY, SO REDUCE SKILLS AND SAVE\n\nThe problem is that the last thing a lean and mean business wants is skilled employees. The reason why has to do with bargaining power. If you possess valuable skills and a company needs to employ somebody with those abilities, you are in a pretty strong negotiating position. You are going to drive a bargain that is very favourable for you. A lean and mean company wouldn\u2019t like that, because \u2018more favourable for you\u2019 means less favourable for the bottom line. Lean-and-meaners really don\u2019t want to be in a position where they have to employ highly-skilled workers who are hard to replace, and can therefore enter negotiations from a strong position. No, they want employees who are less skilled, easier to replace at as short a notice as possible, and therefore in no good position when it comes to negotiating terms of employment.\n\nNow, a question may have arisen in your mind at this point: Given that they sound like such unpleasant places to work, why would anybody seek employment in a lean-and-mean corporation? One reason may be because, however unpleasant they may sound to those of us who are used to the security and benefits that come from working for paternalistic companies, they provide an escape from even worse situations for others. Around the world there are places ravaged by war, affected by disastrous economic policies, ruined by corrupt leaders, and since in such places there will be people who are effectively waving signs that read \u2018employ us! We will accept long hours and low wages!\u2019, lean and mean companies are only too pleased to oblige by setting up sweatshop labour in such places. \n\nBut what about places that do have paternalistic businesses? Surely, in a free market in which every worker may choose who they will and won\u2019t work for, labour would flow toward businesses that care about their employees, offering job security and multiple benefits. Nobody would want to work for a company that thinks its employees are lemons to be squeezed until all their juice runs dry. So how do lean-and-mean businesses survive in a free market?\n\nIT ALL LOOKS GOOD FROM THE TOP\n\nWell, firstly, lean-and-mean businesses only look bad from the perspective of employees below the executive level. But as far as major stockholders are concerned, they are far superior to paternalistic companies. After all, in places like those, company earnings that could be raising shareholder value are being wasted on high wages for the non-executives, on generous pensions, too many paid vacations, health insurance and other benefits that lean-and-meaners have reduced if not eliminated altogether. The stronger Wall Street and its financial equivalents in other countries becomes, and the more emphasis there is placed on improving the bottom line, the more paternalistic companies will feel pressurised into adopting the lean-and-mean model lest they be taken over by their more aggressive rivals.\n\nSo, intimidation from the financial sector are part of the explanation for why employees find themselves in lean-and-mean businesses. But the owner classes don\u2019t just rely on their financial muscle to force the change; they also use technology and propaganda to redefine work in ways that suits them at everybody else\u2019s expense.\n\nAt this point it might be worth going into a little more detail regarding the rise of paternalistic companies in the early 50s through to the seventies, and the emergence of lean-and-mean business practices in the 80s and 90s. \n\nTHE RISE OF PATERNALISM\n\nIf any one thing can be said to have caused the rise of paternalism, it would be the 2nd World War. During the war, the USA achieved full employment for the first time since the 1920s. When the war was over, there was a lot of concern about the possibility of a postwar recession, which the government sought to avoid through various acts and initiatives. The acts included the \u2018Employment Act\u2019 of 1946, which \u201ccommitted the federal government to maintain maximum employment and with it a high level of aggregate demand\u201d. The initiatives included the GI bill, an education initiative that helped upgrade the workforce, thereby providing a large pool of white-collar workers for the administrative and management-type roles that corporations increasingly depended upon.\n\nAs well as anxieties about recession prompting the State to push for high employment, conditions enabled by the war played a part in other ways. For one thing, industry in America was still largely intact, unlike that of Europe\u2019s. The government invested heavily in the business sector, particularly through highway construction and defence-related expenditures. Also, wartime research had helped launch an era of technological innovation, such as IBM\u2019s development of the first general-purpose computer. Finally, wage freezes had been put in place during the war, and this had required employers to use fringe benefits with which to attract employees. This favoured the largest corporations, who could afford to offer greater benefits than their smaller rivals.\n\nBut those corporate benefit packages were still costly, even forty or fifty years ago. This might have discouraged their mass adoption, had it not been for militant unions during the postwar period. It made sense to the larger corporations that if they treated their employees well, that would improve emotional attachment to the company, and the threat of socialism would be avoided.\n\nAnd so it came to pass that the early postwar decades enjoyed economic growth and price stability. The large corporations delivered on their promise of long-term employment prospects, meaning that anyone fortunate enough to land a job there felt secure, and expected that their own prosperity would rise along with the company\u2019s fortunes.\n\nBut all that was to change in the 80s and 90s. \n\nComing up in part five: The rise and consequences of 'Lean And Mean' business practice.",

Two prominent advisors have been added to the team to help Lisk become the go-to platform for Blockchain applications and provider of decentralized services.\n\nLisk has added IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson and serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist Steven Nerayoff as senior advisors, according to Lisk CEO Max Kordek.\n\nHoskinson and Nerayoff were two of the most prominent individuals responsible for the phenomenal success of Ethereum. Their success in the Blockchain, IoT, and decentralized platform industry have been the foundation for their successful cryptography projects and companies.\n\n## Lisk can dominate its crypto sector\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph about this development, Nerayoff says that he regularly gets asked to advise companies and to speak at industry events, but his criteria for attaching himself to companies are clear.  \n\nNerayoff explains:\n\n>\u201cI'm very selective on who I attach my name to in an official capacity. I focus my efforts on companies I believe will dominate their portion of the crypto sector. As I saw early on with Ethereum, I see it again in a complementary way with Lisk and it\u2019s enormous market opportunity.\u201d  \n\nHe also tells Cointelegraph that to accomplish the vision of Lisk requires a lot of smart people working there and a group of seasoned advisors which is the reason why he recruited such friends and industry luminaries as Charles Hoskinson and others. On his role, Nerayoff tells Cointelegraph that he will be advising the Lisk team in the art of building a company that lasts. Being part of Ethereum from the early days, together with his experience as an investor as well as the time spent founding companies, Nerayoff is confident of his acquired perspective.\n\nHe says:\n\n>\u201cI will advise the team on the pitfalls and opportunities they will face in building a successful cryptocurrency and Blockchain app platform. This market by itself is enormous at $77 billion and growing. Further they are positioned very well to help solve the scalability issue which virtually all platforms are facing today.\u201d\n\nNerayoff believes that Lisk will become the go-to platform for Blockchain applications and services, yet supporting various technologies like Ethereum and others as services for Lisk's own Blockchain applications written in JavaScript.  \n\n## Lisk can become more elegant and faster than Ethereum\n\nIn an interview with Cryptocurrency investors Tai Zen and Leon Fu, Hoskinson recognised Lisk as a developing technology, identifying the potential of Lisk to do trusted execution of codes even in more elegant and faster ways than Ethereum, but says the technology must be modified to achieve such.\n\nOne major property of Lisk that Hoskinson identifies is the capacity of Lisk to become a decentralised marketplace for app developers to purchase services which will augment existing apps or develop new ones. Another aspect is that other applications can be run, not necessarily as a side-chain but as delegates where there are stakeholders on the mainchain who elect the delegates.\n\nHoskinson argues:\n\n>\u201cThere is no reason why Lisk cannot grow like Ethereum, but it has to be earned. The good news is that the creators of Lisk have a lot of runway to achieve this. Max has a lot of humility and he listens, that\u2019s a plus. He has to open up. China is pivotal, and the Eastern Blocs too.\u201d\n\nTim Frost, VP Marketing & Business Development at Wirex, thinks that with this development, the future looks really bright for Lisk.\n\nFrost says:\n\n>\u201cCharles Hoskinson is one of the most respected minds in cryptocurrency. His knowledge and insight of the industry and of the smart contract protocols is immense. Having watched him speak on the project, it is very clear Lisk potentially has a very bright future. Few understand the technology more than Hoskinson.\u201d\n\n## Time, attitude, community and focus\n\nOn the prime factors which will determine the success or failure of the project, Hoskinson says that there is no substitute for time and community.\n\nHe notes:\n\n>\u201cThe value of a cryptocurrency is not determined by your technology, but by your community. It is better to focus on the vision, and where the technology is heading.\u201d\n\nHoskinson identifies an early fault in the marketing of Lisk. He points out that Lisk in its early stages was presented like a version of Ethereum, saying that it shouldn\u2019t be so. He sees the Lisk team as an assemblage of good ideas which requires good managers and developers to flourish. According to him, the basic attributes needed by the creator which will enhance the success of the project includes the ability to ask for help, being surrounded by the right people, not rushing into decisions and being meticulous. He also says that the most important thing is to always keep moving forward, even if it is one step at a time.\n\nFinally, Hoskinson comments that most of his work at Lisk will be behind the scenes, managing strategic partnerships and giving advice. He will also be involved in many discussions about strategy.\n\n[Cointelegraph](http://cointelegraph.com/news/new-advisors-could-push-lisk-beyond-ethereum)",

The demo serves as the first showcase for ChromaWay's technology, which it said allows smart contracts to be used with any underlying blockchain, be it bitcoin, Ethereum or a private network.\n\nKairos Future, in turn, managed the process and coordinated an accompanying report, while Lantm\u00e4teriet provided feedback and sponsorship for the effort.\n\nKairos Future senior consultant Magnus Kempe indicated that he believes the biggest benefit of the project is the transparency that the blockchain-based system could provide, and how it could position Sweden as a leader in working with the nascent technology.\n\nKempe told CoinDesk:\n\n>\"What we\u2019re focused on here is the smart contract controlling and making the process visible and transparent. Credit documents are normally something that the buyer and the buyer\u2019s bank are only meant to see, and this technology will allow that to be held private.\"\n\nGoing forward, Kempe and Hjeltes said that Stockholm-based Landshypotek Bank has already signed on to provide additional funding for the project. Further, they said more banks and real estate industry experts would be consulted to help build on the project.\n\nThe project comes as governments around the world are showing growing interest in using blockchain technology to improve the land registry process.\n\nIn April, bitcoin mining and technology company BitFury unveiled a pilot with the National Agency of Public Registry in the Republic of Georgia. The project followed a reported initiative in Honduras that popularized the concept, yet has failed to fully materialize with public acknowledgement from the government.\n\n[CoinDesk](http://www.coindesk.com/sweden-blockchain-smart-contracts-land-registry/)",

Also, my car does not have a cassette player, so the cassette to audio adapter was not an option for me either.  \n\nI have an iPhone and want to listen to music in my car.\n\n## FM Transmitters \nIn the past, I've purchased 5 or more FM Transmitters.  None of them worked.  They were all pieces of junk.   Then I came across the [MPOW Streambot] Bluetooth FM Transmitter.  My first thought was to dismiss it, based on my previous FM Transmitter experiences.  However, after reading the reviews and considering the $30.00 price, I decided to order one.\n\n## Easy Installation\nThe package arrived and I read the instructions, which were really clear and straightforward. After plugging it into the cigarette lighter, I configured Bluetooth on my iPhone and selected a radio frequency,  the device started working.   Now I could enjoy music on my car stereo.  Actually any audio played on your phone can be heard on you car's stereo.  Listen to podcasts, YouTube music, and any of your favorites app's audio.   \n\nAlso, the device has a built in microphone for hands free mobile calling.  Note:  Your experience my vary using the feature, but I wanted to mention it.  \n\n## Superb Sound Quality\nI was amazed at the quality of the sound.   In summary, if you need an inexpensive Bluetooth kit for your car, look no further than the [MPOW Streambot].  You will be glad you did.\n\n[MPOW Streambot]: <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KIMX4EY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00KIMX4EY&linkCode=as2&tag=lifinvmusande-20&linkId=SURCTQYVPPRXEF5P>",

Here is a list of words and meanings to enable you to understand and converse in \u201cbitcoin\u201d lingo!  So when you have your next \"bitcoin\" conversation,  you will at least know what's going on and able to contribute to the discussion.  Educate yourself, it is free.\n\nHere are a few to start with however, at the bottom of the page, you will find a link to a whole lot more!\n\nAddress\n\nA bitcoin address is used to receive and send transactions on the bitcoin network. It contains a string of alphanumeric characters, but can also be represented as a scanable QR code. A bitcoin address is also the public key in the pair of keys used by bitcoin holders to digitally sign transactions (see Public key).\n\nBlockchain\n\nThe full list of blocks that have been mined since the beginning of the bitcoin cryptocurrency. The blockchain is designed so that each block contains a hash drawing on the blocks that came before it. This is designed to make it more tamper proof.\n\nExchange\n\nA central resource for exchanging different forms of money and other assets. Bitcoin Exchanges are typically used to exchange the cryptocurrency for other, typically fiat, currencies.\n\nOrphan block\n\nA block which is not a part of the valid blockchain, but which was instead part of a fork that was discarded.\n\nRipple\n\nA payment network that can be used to transfer any currency (including ad hoc currencies that have been created by users). The network consists of payment nodes and gateways operated by authorities. Payments are made using a series of IOUs, and the network is based on trust relationships.\n\nClick on this link to see the full list compiled by CoinDesk \u2013 http://www.coindesk.com/information/bitcoin-glossary/\nhttp://bit-media.org/bitcoin/talking-in-bitcoin-lingo/\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for news reviews and much more  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE1Y1LP64040veaEbdIYKYw",

    "body": "This is the third post in a series about the Steem reward system.  Please read my [disclaimer](what-my-posts-arent).\n\nPrevious posts: [1](the-steem-reward-system-part-1-v-shares) [2](the-steem-reward-system-part-2-v-shares-from-r-shares)\n\nI took a break from this series of blog posts because there's been an incredible acceleration in the pace of discussion of curation reward proposals, both within the community and internally at Steemit.  I've barely been able to keep up with the discussion, let alone write about it.  But, as @dantheman posted [here](https://steemit.com/steem/@dantheman/changes-to-curation-reward-allocation), the core team has reached consensus on an algorithm and is proceeding with the implementation (although a few minor details remain to be discussed).\n\nThe post I linked in the previous paragraph discusses an algorithm I developed about a month ago in some LaTeX notes which I circulated internally at Steemit.  The primary feedback I got was that my notes were not easy to follow.  Everybody (myself included) initially assumed that this was because those notes contained a lot of advanced mathematics.  But as our internal discussions continued, it slowly became clear that another factor was at play:  I had a different perspective on the problem, which I assumed others would immediately see once they read my notes, even if they couldn't quite follow the details of the math.  When I finally took my focus away from the math and changed my explanations to focus on my perspective, I found it much easier to make a convincing argument and build consensus among the other core developers.\n\nMy next step in this series of blog posts is to bring those same revelations to the Steem community.\n\n# The principles\n\nWe'll start out with a list of *principles*.  Principles are properties that are considered desirable [1] by system designers.  The algorithm itself is a direct *consequence* of these principles.\n\n- The SBS [2] princple.  The SBS principle is that R-shares are fungible, homogenous, and arbitrarily finely divisible.  If Alice and Bob both upvote the same post, neither Alice nor Bob's payout should change regardless of whether Alice keeps her funds in a single account or splits her funds up into accounts Alice1 and Alice2 (all else being equal).\n\n- The proportionality principle.  Upvoters' curation rewards change proportionally for subsequent upvotes.  For example, suppose Alice and Bob vote on the same post, Alice's reward is 200 V-shares, and Bob's reward is 100 V-shares.  The proportionality principle states that if subsequent votes increase Bob's reward to 500 V-shares, then Alice's reward must simultaneously increase to 1000 V-shares.  [3] [4]\n\n- The ultimate indifference principle.  The ultimate indifference principle relates to the concept of an *ultimate upvoter* (UU), a (theoretical) upvoter who has a small balance and is always the last person to upvote a post.  The ultimate indifference principle states that the UU is indifferent about which post she will upvote (assuming she only cares about how many V-shares she personally receives from curation rewards).\n\n- The quadratic reward principle.  The total curation reward of a post in V-shares is equal to some quadratic function `v(R)` [5] of the total R-shares upvoting the post, with a few minor technical restrictions [6].\n\n- The monotonic supply schedule principle.  The weight distributed per R-share decreases as the total upvoting R-shares increases.\n\n# Roadmap\n\nThe next posts in this series will get into some heavy math (because of the SBS principle we have to use differential equations).  For the non-mathematically-inclined reader I'll summarize the most important conclusions:\n\n- The original curation reward algorithm was not created from differential equations and violates the SBS principle.\n\n- Setting rewards equal to `R^2` (i.e. `s = 0`) results in a non-monotonic supply schedule, so we must set `s > 0`.\n\n- I will provide suggestions for how to set the model's three parameters `A`, `B` and `s`.\n\n# Meta-discussion issues\n\nAny discussion of changes to the reward system may get contentious due to the non-trivial amounts of STEEM involved.  I mostly prefer to stay away from blockchain politics and focus strictly on technical matters.  Here are a few thoughts which I hope will clarify the boundary of the topic under discussion and hopefully keep the comments from degenerating too far:\n\n- Grinding of political axes fits much better [here](https://steemit.com/steem/@dantheman/steem-governance-and-changing-the-rules) or [here](https://steemit.com/steem/@dantheman/changes-to-curation-reward-allocation), I have very little to add to what @dantheman said in those posts.\n\n- The CEO of Steemit, Inc. is the top curation rewards recipient according to the old code.  If the developers' objective was to use the curation reward system to allow whales / insiders to more easily line their pockets, we wouldn't be pushing for changes.\n\n- There are technical costs to maintaining multiple reward systems.  If we can get a new system that's demonstrably better than the old system implemented and adequately tested before July 4, it will make me very happy as a backend developer if we can then delete the old system code.\n\n- There's a single unique algorithm which simultaneously follows all of the principles in this post.  If you accept the principles, then you must accept my algorithm as the One True Curation Reward Algorithm, since it logically follows from the principles.\n\n- Selecting a set of principles is an important problem, but it is a problem of a social, political or philosophical nature.  Such questions are out of scope for this series of posts.  I want to focus on the strictly technical problem of deriving an algorithm from this particular set of principles.\n\n- If you object to any of these principles, it is up to you to lay out a viable alternative set of principles, construct a convincing social/political/philosophical argument for your principles which is accepted by the community, and solve the same technical problem of how to derive an algorithm from your principles.\n\n[1] Rewards should be fair, incentivize behavior which enhances the community, and have a simple and efficient implementation.\n\n[2] SBS stands for \"satoshi by satoshi\".\n\n[3] The proportionality principle is equivalent to stating that each upvote is assigned some *weight*, and the post's total V-shares curation reward is divided proportionally to the weights.\n\n[4] The astute reader may notice that the SBS principle and proportionality principle sound similar, and ask whether one of these principles is a special case of the other.  The SBS principle and the proportionality principle both describe forms of homogeneity.  However, stake may cease to be homogenous due to the time order in which it votes.  The SBS principle says R-shares (the \"stuff\" used to vote) are homogenous, the proportionality principle says weight (the \"stuff\" used to assign rewards) is homogenous.  The weight per R-share may change as the post is upvoted without violating the proportionality principle or the SBS principle (as long as this change only depends on the amount of R-shares seen by the post).  So it is possible to have a system where (Alice votes, then Bob votes) does not have the same consequence as (Bob votes, then Alice votes) while respecting both the SBS principle and the proportionality principle.\n\n[5] I used the notation v-bar in the internal Steemit notes and my previous post.  But I decided to drop the v-bar due to Unicode issues.\n\n[6] These minor technical restrictions are as follows:\n\n- `v(R)` has a leading coefficient of 1\n- `v(0) = 0`\n- `v'(R) >= 0` when `R >= 0`\n\nThese restrictions mean that `v` is the parabola `y = x^2` with the origin shifted to the right by some amount `s`.  The general form of such `v` is `v(R) = (R+s)^2 - s^2` with `s >= 0`.",

This means that the reward for bitcoin mining will go from 25 to 12,5 bitcoin every 10 minutes. What impact will this have on Bitcoin pricing? Will the decrease in reward still be profitable the miners? Will supply meet demand? Many questions\u2026\n\nBitcoin has a finite supply and will not exceed 21 000 000, this makes Bitcoin deflationary and very attractive to the investor. We also know that generally more demand increases the price however, looking back in history at the last halving, just 4 years ago, there was no real impact on the price which was $13.40 at the time (12 November 2012). Might be a different story in July as the price is hovering around $450 as well as interest and adoption of Bitcoin is steadily rising.\n\nA Price spike could also cause congestion and delays on the blockchain which will result in delay in transaction time and confirmation. This scenario could cause miners to stop mining due to lack of profitability, the Hash rate (mining power) will drop and the difficultly level of the hashing work that has to be done will increase. It takes 2016 blocks before the system readjusts to the lower hash rate however, none of this would happen if the block size cap was increased. Bitcoin Classic have been trying to get this change from 1 megabyte to 2 megabytes agreed for a few months already.\n\nBitcoin and the Blockchain technology is a democracy and stakeholders need to vote and agree the way forward. Read more about the Block size discussion \u2013 more people are for this change than against https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy\n\nOn the price prediction, Bitcoin security expert Andreas Antonopoulos says \u201cI can\u2019t predict price. No one can. Anyone who does, even for minutes, is lying. The reward halving will change the inflation rate in Bitcoin. How that affects the overall economy depends on the conditions of all the other parameters in the economy: price, adoption, transaction volume, hashrate, difficulty, investments, other currencies, world market conditions, etc.\u201d\n\nWhat is your opinion?

And I love Siberia )\n\nhttps://pp.vk.me/c628016/v628016557/1b022/EO1yE4gmn4M.jpg\n\nUsually I work hard (I was an odd-jobber, a builder, a driver, something else), but I have hobbies too.\n\nI love anime and make 'madskillz' (you can see my posts on Steemit: https://steemit.com/anime/@elt/the-daily-waifu-1 or https://steemit.com/anime/@elt/the-daily-waifu-2). This is an beautiful art where you place a 2d image (from movie or animation) in a 3d background. Maybe japanese corporations and authors of these characters understand that I do it for fun only (Oh, I hope.).\n\nAlso I draw anime on walls (but ts-s! This is not legal, right? :) You can see one of these anime paintings (because it is removed already from wall):\n\nhttps://pp.vk.me/c636722/v636722557/104a6/Y75SXW_PVl0.jpg\n\nAlso I love computers and learn bash. Love *nix instead Windows and Krita instead Adobe Photoshop.\n\nSorry for an mistakes, they are not definitely one of my hobbies )\n\nNice to meet you, steemit authors and readers!

    "body": "**ICONOMI found management platform** is currently in ICO and you can still invest. \n\nThat is most anticipated platform of 2016 why You may ask me. I will give you some graph and explanation. Solutions like ICONOMI are very popular in old economy people want be rich and wanted get more profit so they tried give money to people who know more about trading. Found management platforms preforms much better than average investors. Big guys just want invest not day trading. In crypto ICOMI will be 1st such project - such needed project.\n\nNow true facts and everything that I show you, is now publicly available on web. Graphs taken from coinmarketcap.com are showing us, what is going on cryptocurrency markets right now:\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FLe0WeF.jpg) \n![](http://i.imgur.com/s6Aeke2.jpg) \n![](http://i.imgur.com/RX0JK1z.jpg) \n\nYou see on won eyes that: Bitcoin is loosing over time market share to other alt coins. There is many multiple reasons for that. Without ICONOMI getting on cryptocurrency board for new investors will be VERY hard. \nThat is:\n  \n- choose right one coin. \n- skip scams \n- buy valuable coins \n-  crypto markets are getting bigger and bigger all time, there is about over 700coins tradable now\n\n\nICONOMI will be platform that for **every investor looking for big profits**. \nICONOMI will give us 2 founds:\n\n- **The ICONOMI.INDEX FUND** - a \"Passive\" - Coin Traded Fund (CTF). This fund operates on special rules, variables that manage the fund through automation. This Found will be the fastest available to investors at launch in Q4 2016 - The ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE FUND - an \"\nActive\"\n- **Coin Managed Fund (CMF)**, Operated by and managed by best investors. This fund will be invitation only available. If you invest in ICO you will get you invitation for free. I bet is worth its price. Those found will be carefully managed by ICONOMI experts and will provide best profits available.\n\nGraphs shows that volume of alt coins is rising heavily and will move up. Without ICONOMI founds many investors will probably lose cash on market, while rypto currency market will rise as whole. **If buy some ICO shares you will get dividends forever as share holder.**\n Soon real professional traders will come to cryptocurrency and you as investor in order to get big profits will have to use service of ICONOMI. \n\nPersonally I have invested in ICO and believe that **ICONOMI is future of crypto trading**.

We give the same chance to everyone, rich, poor, alcoholic, drug addict, young or old.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The management of a patient goes from shaving the beard of a man to the presentation on the toilet, the room arrangement the carefully tended beds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Lunch arrived around 8:30 am, few patient is in the dining hall for breakfast, other unfinished eat in bed Logistical assistance serves meals that are different if the patient is diabetic, diet, dieters, old, or in solid supply resumption. You should know that when the patient has had a stroke, a stroke, swallowing is absent, which means that if the patient eats a sandwich, but he swallows the bread goes in the bronchial tubes and not in the stomach, giving a false swallowing, bronchi become infected and it's a disaster. So this patient who made false swallowing should eat while cream consistency and drink thickened liquid. Which is not very good but I admit it must go through these stages in order to re-eat a day normally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Physiotherapists arrive at 9am and leave a 17h, occupational therapists also. There is also a neuropsychologist, a speech therapist and all do work that allows the patient to regain maximum independence, which means that the patient all day is busy. Visitors can come between 14:30 and 19:30.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>After lunch, we continue our work, when all is well, we finish around 10:30 or 11am but sometimes it is noon we are still in the rooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In terms of handling, the entry of the patient, it is usually in bed or in a wheelchair with a right hemiplegia or left, some have forgotten that they had half a disabled body, so it must withstand and no wear and show him how to do with one leg to go from wheelchair to bed and vice versa. Others are completely invalid, they know not move neither arms nor legs, and for those, or we wear them either we lift them with a forklift.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>During dinner, we feed the disabled and we encode our care in the computer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Around 13h, we are a few naps after going on the toilet. Sometimes we have a problem in the pants, oops! When everyone is changed to bed, we have a service change ratio and the time, the hour of the end of our service is lagging. At 14h is the start of the morning shift. For my part, I take a good shower and I take the way home or waiting for my cats and my dog makes me a big party.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We must not believe that the nursing profession is simple, each service is different and you can not compare the care of each other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I hope I have not bothered you with this long text, I wish you a good day to you all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

It's funny how we can get so caught up in work and the business of a crazy life and miss the simply beauty along the way. Sometime you've just got to stop and smell the roses; and while you're there, take a picture!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-3-1024x768-300x225.jpeg\"/></p>\n<p>These aren't roses, I know: they're wild flowers. They don't get the nurture and care that roses do, and yet they are provided for and they bloom into beautiful blossoms in their own time. They have a harder life than others, and that's how we humans are as well. Some of us were well taken care of growing up and were treated like roses, while others were left in the field to grow up alone and without the love and care we should have had. But we are all beautiful in our own ways and if we survive long enough, we will blossom into something spectacular.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_6440-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Colorado mountain rivers</h2>\n<p>When the snow on the tops of the mountains melt, it feed the rushing rivers that carve their way down the mountainside. The climbing is excellent, the whether and the views are truly gorgeous, but something about the rivers rushing through the mountains draws you in. There is a memorization about the brave rivers unafraid of the mountains and simply rushing on by recklessly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_6031-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Mississippi at sunset</h2>\n<p>Sometimes the world just slows down and magic happens. This was one of those times. On the night before my sister's wedding in Tupelo, Mississippi the sky exploded in color. What a calm reassurance before a monumental event: the approval stamp of God upon the sanction of their marriage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_5829-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Hundreds of years old Indian hieroglyphs in Arizona</h2>\n<p>This was an incredible hike in the Arizona mountain ranges to discover a place where the Apache Indians, or perhaps some other tribe had lived hundreds of years ago!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2015-07-13-06-37-59-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Uganda, Africa at twilight, from a moving bus</h2>\n<p>Africa is always an adventure, but in 2015 we took a safari on the northern rim and caught this shot on the way back to the lodge. I love how the beauty of the world is unique in its diversity from place to place, even across the Atlantic.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.theanonymousnovelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_7281-1024x1024-300x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>This is one of my favorite shots. I don't remember where I took it or when, but the colors, the bliss, the peacefulness of this field of flowers was stunning. I'm glad I was able to capture an image of its beauty to remember it by. And to think, all of this beauty was made by God in a second! His power to create a world is amazing and perfect in every way. We get to see His marvelous creation every day!&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Follow me <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@ejaredallen\">@ejaredallen </a>for more pictures and great content!</h2>\n</html>",

All stories depicted here either happened directly to people I knew, or were described to me as &nbsp;a <em>it's-russia-get-used-to-it </em>anecdote.<br>\nYes, I will be talking about corruption and paying people under the table for things but bear in mind that even though it seems like a common practice definitely not all people do that and not all people experience the phenomenon.</p>\n<h3>A ROUTINE POLICE CHECK<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p>It is said that it is extremely wise to keep 2k-5k Rubles (about 28-68 Euro, 30-77 Dollars, 23-58 Pounds) in your registration papers at all times. They tend to disappear when you get your documents back from the officer... If one does not have such loose change, the guy tends to make one's life difficult. \"<em>You were speeding\", \"You didn't stop at the STOP sign\", \"You're light is out\" </em>etc. Driving is another interesting phenomenon in Moscow. You might think that since the metro is so packed, the streets will be empty. On the contrary, but I will not get into that right now as that makes a completely different post... &nbsp;However, what I will tell you is &nbsp;how one of my students passed her driving exam, which leads us to...</p>\n<h3>PAYING TO PASS AN EXAM</h3>\n<p>After her first failed attempt, my student looked at her instructor/examiner and asked: \"Could you please tell me what I did wrong, so I can work on it in the future?\" He stared back at her surprised and announced: \"Well, you didn't pay me extra, what do you expect?!\" At that point even I was shocked - \"So people openly tell you they want money?!\" \"Get used to it Kasia, It's Russia....\"<br>\nNeedless to say, she was forced to pay the second time around and surprise, surprise, she passed....<br>\n<br>\nI taught English in a company. I came one week, and saw that everyone was kind of in a rush and slightly agitated. I asked what the problem was and they said they were waiting for an audit. I remember wishing them good luck... One lady looked at me and smiled \"We paid the guys to look the other way, it will be fine!\" I didn't even bother to comment as I had aleady known there was no point...</p>\n<h3>GETTING INTO A PRIVATE EVENT</h3>\n<p>It was the three of us - my BF, his friend and I. We wanted to do some clubbing and the friend decided we should go to a very trendy bar in the heart of Moscow. He had a loyalty card there and was well known among the bouncers. We didn't really look the part, but a hefty fee paid for each of us (by the friend) was enough to let us in...</p>\n<p>That was a minor party. Let's talk about the big stuff, involving bigger money!<br>\nIf you know someone, who knows someone, who knows someone you might be able to (legally) attend the dress rehearsal of the famous Victory Parade in May (the 9th to be exact). It costs about 10k (137 Euro, 116 Pounds , 153 Dollars) Watch fragments of the video below to see the magnitude of what I am talking about.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The whole thing is long, play with it a little bit. The good stuff starts at about 40 minutes. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4qBu3EvraPWezHbaC7npIQ\">Source</a></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EI3FYynz-Q</p>\n<p>To enter the actual parade however, you need to be a prominent member of the society (e.g. ex-military) or someone famous or filthy rich :)</p>\n<p>The event itself is quite impressive and for soldiers taking part in the march it is an honor among honors. &nbsp;<br>\nWe had the privilege of living 15 minutes on foot from the Red Square so we saw all the preparations and marches right outside our windows (till 11pm at night...)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3OMfOqwX2pQ5BYeql8V1tg4J6VcMzG75pLD-nhsfHw0BYFLEQOQSeVl-sVdEkDwS6VfPco-FukpjwQONwimoOhzzT4GIPDt_VGbJfNDYaltTvEcyOFK5do7PZD1-tjDW0nxKYhUQdxG4yoxX6ZS590fMaveLKSI2Voz579yTME9U8D7UgN7R3ufBrAcq0KV8kA9VqMVxryabh2X_jBiMnP3Uwjj_hrWn3ARzHggZMRuo3G3ORSKDpoqcBA25bRDeWHe7nVT4X58NolQ4yY8HVjzyUr4zDneI8dy_eHnSf0F0FBZ8kn4NQQ3ueVR84tu-Ot64CZb9a1SetmKmupvAxBbuS8z3jBsvCECD8A5jz9qevTOkgHEbV0z2hVteH64gCLg3OI9mRVqw2GWAYwNSUlGGtwCxmwXq3p_j_igwncarIhIF2HX_bV0ACrucmewR6IiIdVfaKKAO9g2ycLbJRr_SBwE9TxBND9ar0R267Grzq5SHywG71h1nxZnXInW-HQ2l1cou8zqdiEUanqkeSbgIunZVNBcEnYYinmF-WZd5y0_Luc8rdDYy0GlKAtAJ4z0-woKDs6d_XKWhiWsYOAW3rWwCe3cJylK_6H7wNO2PlBKL=w1163-h775-no\" width=\"1162\" height=\"775\"/></p>\n<p>PS.

    "body": "## In this episode, a hot Aedapt girl helps Jack escape Killer giant Cockroaches! ##\n\n**Jake was peering through cracks between the plaster laths back into the room where they guard stood.** \n\n![enter image description here](https://s22.postimg.org/d4vifrmo1/Madison.jpg)\n***Missed an episode? Great more great reading for you [on my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr)! Be sure to follow me for awesome daily updates in your feed and leave me comments. I love comments!***\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not that smart when we\u2019re under. We can really only do what we hear them telling us to do.\u201d Jake whispered, calmly as the big guard moved within inches of the wall, snorting. The guard turned, blasted a hole in the ceiling with his gun and charged back into the hall. \n\n*They heard him blasting the door of the next room open.*\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve got this one on a signal blocker and there\u2019s not much time.\u201d \n\nThe girl turned and ran to a corner, where an iron hand rail rose up out of the floor in a curve. She disappeared through the floor and as Jack followed, he found a narrow, spiraling stair that led below. \n\nHe lost his footing and slid down the stairs, narrowly missing the girl. She stood in the room below, with ear to the door that led into the hall.\n\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.org/90derv079/spiral_stair.jpg)\n\n*Jake followed close behind. The girl with the violet eyes opened the door and stepped out into the hall with the awakened Nosher right behind her and Jack bringing up the rear. Jack had no idea what to do next, but the girl seemed to be in her element, and willing to help.*\n\n**Hopefully, she was not leading them into more danger.** \n\nHe followed her past one door, and into the darkened room where they had first started. It was empty, which could only mean one thing. The Noshers who had recently occupied it were upstairs right now with the ugly guard. They were looking for Jack and the others and would soon head back down.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we just get out of here?\u201d Jack said. He stood with his back to the wall and the door opened a crack so that one eye could see down the hall toward the upper stairs.\n\n\u201cNot without these,\u201d the girl walked to where the guard had been and pointed up at the weapons, suspended above. She ran a hand along the doorframe, \u201cIt ought to be along here somewhere.\u201d She said.\n\n**\u201cWhat is?\u201d Jack hissed, shifting as her body pressed against his.** \n\nShe ran her hand along the top of the doorframe. He froze; she smelled good. It had been a long time since a girl had gotten this close to him, junior prom, in fact. He did not have a lot of time for dating with his work schedule. \n\n*To top it off, the smell of burnt fries that clung to him even after an hour in the shower was hardly an aphrodisiac.*\n\nThe girl put one hand on his chest and stood on tiptoe, pressing tight against him. \u201cOh, don\u2019t kid yourself; you just happened to be in my way.\u201d She laughed, scornfully, and pressed a hidden button at the top right corner of the door. Weapons rained down with a crash, and she quickly chose two handguns, handing one to Jack. \n\nShe pressed the button again, and the remaining weapons zipped back up into position. Jack had to grip the gun in his hand firmly to keep it from joining them.\n\n![enter image description here](https://s13.postimg.org/xp1l7jjyv/guns.jpg)\n\n**\u201cElectro magnet,\u201d she said and opened the door, moving out, weapon first.**\n\n\u201cI knew that,\u201d Jack said. He flattened himself against the hallway wall, like a TV detective. The magnet had occurred to him, but in his addled state, he had not really grasped the concept. Mostly he just did not like the idea of her being smarter than he was. \n\n\u201cKeep up\u201d he hissed to Jake, who had managed to grab a revolver.\nThe three moved quickly down the hall and turned toward the front door. The two roaches Jack had seen earlier, peered out from either side. \n\n**They had weapons leveled in his direction.**\n\n*The girl crouched and moved forward as if she were still a Nosher. It worked. Jack followed suit, and Jake did his best. His human consciousness was getting stronger by the minute.* \n\nHe had even started getting color back in his cheeks, and Jack was beginning to notice that the man seemed oddly familiar, the more human he became. \u201cCould be a side effect of this Nosher thinking,\" he guessed.\n\n\u201cThey're right behind us,\u201d the girl hissed to one of the roaches. \u201cBlast the next thing that comes down those stairs, you got me?\u201d \n\n**The bug clicked and hissed.** \n\n*Jack assumed it was a yes, because the two giant insects moved in and took up positions on either side of the hall.*\n\nJack bolted out the door and was relieved to see the Rabbit zip up just in time. Phineas sat behind the wheel, and the Things were nowhere in sight. Behind them, they heard the roaches open fire, and then a huge blast echoed down the hall. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s13.postimg.org/4klau8zdj/phin_rabbit.jpg)\n\nA gust of wind barreled out the door, raining cockroach guts over the three escaping figures. Jake stumbled, and Jack picked him up and shoved him into the back seat of the Rabbit.\n\nHe turned back to let the girl in, but she was gone. Phineas stood up on the running board, slapping the roof of the vehicle furiously. \u201cGet in the car! Let\u2019s go man!\u201d\n\n*By the time Jack had slid into the passenger seat, Phineas had the Rabbit patching out. They were up to top speed in a matter of seconds.*\n\n**\u201cFind a me a safe dime!\u201d Phineas yelled, standing as he worked the pedals and tried to see over the steering wheel at the same time.**\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack yelled over the whine of the engine.\n\n\u201cDime, a dimension, get us out of here.\u201d Phineas pleaded.\n\nJack opened the glove compartment and fiddled with the controls, but nothing happened.\n\n**\u201cDamn, guess I have to do everything, Phineas grumbled, \u201chere, take the wheel.\u201d** \n\n*The Leprechaun ducked under Jack\u2019s arms as he grabbed the steering wheel from his position in the passenger\u2019s seat.* \n\nPhineas leaned across the stick shift, his feet working the pedals as he started manipulating the glovebox controls. Jack\u2019s view through the windshield changed every few seconds. It was making steering from the passenger\u2019s seat even more of a challenge.\n\n*Meanwhile, Jake hunkered down in the back seat. From where Jack sat, he was not looking so good. He wondered how much time they had left.*\n\nJack swerved to miss a slow-moving vehicle that had just appeared as they shifted dimensions. Finally, Phineas settled for one that put them on a narrow two-lane country road. \n\nThe town disappeared, replaced by rows of fences. Phineas braked and turned off onto the shoulder of the road, rolling to a stop.\n\nJack\u2019s heartbeat slowly returned to normal. Meanwhile, Jake sounded like he was winding up in the back seat, his voice rolling into a high-pitched whine, perforated with short puffs of breath, like a woman in labor on a late-night sitcom.\n\n**\u201cYou okay, back there?\u201d Jack asked, climbing out onto the shoulder.** \n\nJake launched himself out of the back seat, landed face down in a shallow ditch, and promptly lost the entire contents of his stomach in a single \n\n\u201cralph\u201d.\n--------\n\nJack turned away, pulling his elbow up over his nose to avoid the horrendous smell of vomit. Meanwhile, Phineas dove around the hood of the car and into the ditch, pawing through the puke as if he was panning for gold. \n\n*A few seconds later, he came up for air, triumphantly holding the thumb drive.*\n\nHe stood, wiping his hands on Jake\u2019s jacket, and then looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s past time,\u201d He said, pulling the transmitter from the man\u2019s neck. Jake lolled into the ditch; his eyes fluttered, and Phineas shoved Jack toward the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n**\u201cLet\u2019s go. We don\u2019t want to be here when they come to collect him.\u201d He said, climbing into the passenger\u2019s seat.**\n\n***Will Jake see the girl again? What about his Nosher friend, what becomes of him? Will they ever get the smell out of the ALICE? Stay tuned!***\n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

While I didn't get to read or see the article until someone mailed me a physical copy, I found out that my article had started a number of discussions and follow-on commentary.\n\nDuring my stay at Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp I observed many economic theories put into effect by inmates and the prison administration, including Gresham's law, hyperinflation, currency exchange, and others.\n\nThere are two markets in prison, the \"Administration Run Market\" (ARM) and the \"Inmate Run Market\" (IRM). \n\nFor the ARM, family and friends can add money to your account through Western Union, MoneyGram, or mailing a check. These funds get added to your account fairly quickly and can be used almost immediately, however with a strict spending limit. You get 300 minutes of phone use per month for about $70, and email costs about $0.05 a minute and is only available at specific times to specific people. Once a week you can shop in the commissary with a $360 a month spending limit. Further, certain products have limits of how much you can buy, for example the Mackerel (described below). Alternatively, the IRM is where you can buy sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, Italian ices, hire a personal trainer, get a haircut, pay someone to clean your cube, repair a watch, even inmate run caterers for your birthday or going home party. Additionally there were inmate run 'stores' which sold commissary items at a markup since you could only commissary shop once a week.\n\n[![mackerel-203x300.png](https://s18.postimg.org/pkn7zm1h5/mackerel_203x300.png)](https://postimg.org/image/iu6qq6eb9/)\n\nThe Mackerel (meaning literal packets of fish) is one of the competing currencies in the IRM. It has utility by being one of the best sources of protein on the compound. You can save it for a long time, the shelf life is a few years. The price is relatively the same across all prisons in the country, so even if you transfer prisons your property comes with you, including your Mackerel which is worth the same somewhere else. Unlike tunafish, chicken packets and protein bars, more people eat Mackerel. Those other food items can be used as currency as well, for example the guy who fixes your watch may only accept protein bars because he hates fish. There was even a form of digital currency being used, which I will discuss in another post.\n\n[![pzyQaHU.png](https://s15.postimg.org/tggsqn3uj/pzy_Qa_HU.png)](https://postimg.org/image/nfj3tkh87/)\n\nUtility and medium of exchange give it some value but what about scarcity ? If there is a virtually unlimited amount of Mackerel in the IRM, just like the Federal Reserve printing money, there is no scarcity and hyperinflation can occure if it is debased. \n\nUsing a simple equation, 467 (Number of Inmates) * 14 (Maximum Quantity Allowed to Purchase Per Inmate) * 52 (weeks, assuming every inmate buys the maximum mount of Mackerel every week)\n\nSo if in 2015 we assume that the Supply and Velocity grows at the exact same rate with the Price Level and Transactions unchanging, the amount of Mackerel would essentially double on an even inflation rate. This does not factor in the 3 year shelf life, where expired Mackerel becomes a secondary currency. I will discuss in my next post. \n\nI like to believe that the value of money is determined also psychological factors, like a commodity and not only by mechanical or mathematical factors. In prison many of these psychological factors come into play.\n\n[![1867-1967-Ten-10\u00a2-Cents-Commemorative-Centennial.jpg](https://s15.postimg.org/yqgpkthrv/1867_1967_Ten_10_Cents_Commemorative_Centennial.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/ceiwrfinr/)\n\nMost people use Mackerel as a day-to-day currency for normal transactions, but for reasons I will explain in my next post, they are not the best long term store of value which is important for a currency. For longer term store of value, many inmates use stamps. Stamps have a set rate by the United States Postal Service and have similar characteristics as Mackerel aside for being edible. However, with the introduction of email on the compound many people stopped writing letters as email is cheaper and faster therefore reducing stamps ability to be a transactional currency as a majority of the inmates have no use for them. As a store of value they still hold weight because they are small and easy to store large amounts, while Mackerel is not.\n\nThe biggest value stamps have is that they can be mailed home and your family can redeem them for dollars as the local post office, but that feature can be stopped by better mail screening and overnight the stamp could lose its store of value utility. \n\nIn my next post I will discuss how currency exchangers work, what happens when the prison administration purposely floods the market, and how a secondary currency was created out of expired Mackerel called \u201cMoney Maks\u201d",

    "body": "Let's analyze more deeply the relationship between USD and Oil. This is a continuation of this 3 part series, and in this part I will describe my opinions how to trade Oil, despite it's unpredictability. Here is the previous part:\n\n<center>https://steemit.com/money/@profitgenerator/the-Oil-market-1-3</center>\n\n------------------------------------\n<br/>\n<center>[![oilfield-643836_1920.jpg](https://s16.postimg.org/j6asrkj79/oilfield_643836_1920.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/5cmg2iqlt/)</center>\n\n<center><h1>Oil and Dollar</h1></center>\n\nBefore we go into strategies, I have to explain more thoroughly what relationship I was talking about in the past article.\n\nSo we know that the Oil is denominated by the US Dollar, and we know that a cheap Oil is good for the US Economy, but I wasn't very precise here, this is not entirely true, there is something more here.\n\nFirst of all the commodity market is the only thing that keeps the US Dollar stable, since the Nixon lifting of the Gold standard. The USD is printed at will and the commodities are the only thing that give it some residual value.\n\nSo the commodity market has to be as liquid as possible in order to keep the USD stable, because every ounce of Gold, gram of grain or drop of Oil bought gives value to the USD, because it goes through the USD market.\n\nBut also the commodity market cannot be high in price, because that is bad for the USD. So you have to have a very liquid commodity market, but one that has low price. It sounds very contradictory (the velocity of money theory forbids this), so how you do you achieve this?\n\nWith a Paper Ponzi Scheme: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_certificate\n\nBy issuing commodities on paper, that are not backed by real commodities, or in other words extremely leveraged instruments. You can read more about this popular scam here:\n\n<center>http://www.silverdoctors.com/Gold/Gold-news/comex-Gold-leverage-skyrockets-to-a-shocking-5421/\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-06-25/comex-registered-silver-now-more-leveraged-Gold</center>\n\n<center>[![Leverage-Of-COMEX-Registered-Silver-Contracts.png](https://s17.postimg.org/bgdwcshn3/Leverage_Of_COMEX_Registered_Silver_Contracts.png)](https://postimg.org/image/vnrc53f4b/)</center>\n<center>*(Source: https://srsroccoreport.com)*</center>\n\nNow I am not sure if the same phenomena is happening to Oil as well, but it could be possible. The entire commodity market is undervalued while derivatives and over-leveraged scams are the popular choice of investment for investors.\n\nSo if this is true, then Oil, and the whole commodity market would be into a bullish run possibly. But what about the USD? Yes, the USD itself is in trouble too. The US national debt and outstanding liabilities are too big, and I think the FED will just do QE any minute now, printing up Dollars and perhaps pumping up the commodity market too.\n\nAlright so now it is very confusing, in the past article I established a bearish trend, and now I am saying a bullish scenario could happen? So which one is it. Well let's take them 1 by 1:\n\n* Venezuela economic collapse and Middle East wars = **Bullish**\n* Big Oil price not good for US so they will suppress it with any tool available = `Bearish`\n* OPEC increased Oil production together with [Iran's lifted embargo](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/world/middleeast/embargo-lifted-iranian-Oil-reaches-europe.html) = `Bearish` \n* Russia building Oil pipeline in South Europe =  `Bearish`\n* China investing in Africa and importing Oil =  **Bullish** (since the growing Chinese economy is a big Oil demand)\n* Rising Green Energy markets = `Bearish`\n* Paper ponzi scheme could collapse anytime = **Bullish**\n* New rounds of quantitative easing to erode global debts = **Bullish**\n\nSo it looks to me like a whipsaw, again it could be quantified to have more accurate numbers, but it looks like the risk is big in the market. I would certainly not go long or short on it, since it's pretty unpredictable based on these macroeconomic trends. Whatever monopoly controls the price of Oil has made sure to make the price unpredictable, so that people will be wiped out on both sides.\n\nSo then how to trade this, if long and short positions are too risky, what to do?\n\n----------------------\n<br/>\n<center>[![money-finance-bills-500.jpg](https://s17.postimg.org/simy7jp3j/money_finance_bills_500.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/kd4w9e0uj/)</center>\n\n\n<center><h1>Trading the Oil Market</h1></center>\n\nIf long and short positions are too risky, then hedging is the only strategy left in my opinion. I would not trade Oil naked, but if we hedge it with the right instrument, it could be profitable.\n\n<center><h2>[Hedging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_%28finance%29)</h2></center>\n\nBut what to hedge, what pairs to hedge and how? Well there are many combinations, and you have to find the pairs that will make you money nontheless.\n\nBut let's cut the crap, I have found a setup that is ultra profitable, and I will share it with you, in exchange you can donate me some SBD and upvote my post and follow me, that is the least you can do for showing you this ultra profitable trading strategy.\n\nSo here are the pairs:\n* Oil / USD\n* XAU / USD\n* USD / JPY\n* DJI / USD\n\nWe will construct our `artificial index` from these, I will call it `ProfitGenerator`:\n\n<center>[![profitgenerator.png](https://s12.postimg.org/421peh5v1/profitgenerator.png)](https://postimg.org/image/feeaw9ejt/)</center>\n\nThis is how `ProfitGenerator` looks like, it is really a @profitgenerator, going up and up since 2009. The formula is the following:\n`BUY   Oil / USD`\n`SELL   XAU / USD`\n`SELL   USD / JPY`\n`BUY   DJI / USD`\n\nSo basically by buying the DOW 30  and Oil, and selling Gold and the USD/JPY, we get this artificial index that always makes our profits go up since 2009. Of course it has dips and volatility, but the trend line looks to go up:\n\n<center>[![trend.png](https://s13.postimg.org/7c4281afb/trend.png)](https://postimg.org/image/mktzlt43n/)</center>\n\nI have extrapolated it linearly in the future, and it could be a profitable investment.Looks like easy money to me, I might check it out as well, and look for even better hedging strategies.\n\n---------------------------\n\nBasically this is how I would trade Oil at the moment, not naked, but put inside this nice hedging strategy. So if you decide to try it out, you should reward me after you made some profits!\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n*Data sources: http://www.investing.com*\n\n***Disclaimer: The information provided on this page might be incorrect.

    "body": "Each day more and more people are jumping onto the \u201cgreen\u201d bandwagon as an attempt protect themselves and \nfamilies from the hidden dangers in chemical products. It\u2019s no secret anymore that many of these concoctions are \nloaded with carcinogens that damage the neurological, reproductive, and hormonal systems.\n\n For example fluoride is a substance found in most drinking water that to me and many doctors alike would say is unethical.\n \nFluoride is not an essential nutrient. No disease, not even tooth decay, is caused by a \u201cfluoride deficiency.\u201d Not a single biological process has been shown to require fluoride. On the contrary there is extensive evidence that fluoride can interfere with many important biological processes. Fluoride interferes with numerous enzymes. In combination with aluminum, fluoride interferes with G-proteins. Such interactions give aluminum-fluoride complexes the potential to interfere with signals from growth factors, hormones and neurotransmitters. More and more studies indicate that fluoride can interfere with biochemistry in fundamental ways.\n\nFluoride may damage the brain. According to the National Research Council, \u201cit is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain.\u201d In a review of the literature commissioned by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), fluoride has been listed among about 100 chemicals for which there is \u201csubstantial evidence of developmental neurotoxicity.\u201d Animal experiments show that fluoride accumulates in the brain and alters mental behavior in a manner consistent with a neurotoxic agent. In total, there have now been over 100 animal experiments showing that fluoride can damage the brain and impact learning and behavior. According to fluoridation proponents, these animal studies can be ignored because high doses were used. However, it is important to note that rats generally require five times more fluoride to reach the same plasma levels in humans. Further, one animal experiment found effects at remarkably low doses. In this study, rats fed for one year with 1 ppm fluoride in their water (the same level used in fluoridation programs), using either sodium fluoride or aluminum fluoride, had morphological changes to their kidneys and brains, an increased uptake of aluminum in the brain, and the formation of beta-amyloid deposits which are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Other animal studies have found effects on the brain at water fluoride levels as low as 5 ppm.\n\nWhile fluoridation may not be the greatest environmental health threat, it is one of the easiest to end. \nMany People are aware of these issues and today there are more alternative options than ever before.\n\nwaterliberty.com is one site I've came across with products and tips for a  healthier lifestyle. \n\nTo find more info on fluoride this is a good site: fluoridealert.org/articles/50-reasons/",

    "body": "I did a few of these a while back, I was experimenting with the technique.  It was fun and I might well do some more, especially if there's an audience for them\n\nThe basic technique is to first to take a video clip and split it into a number of frames.   I expect you can do this easily in Photoshop or something, but I'm a command line kind of guy so I used ffmpeg and ImageMagick  - I learned a lot from reading [this post about it](\"https://room208.org/blog/posts/48793543478.html\").  I go for things that break down into about 12-24 frames because at 24 fps you're going to need 12 to get a half second loop.\n\nThen you load up each frame in your favourite graphics editor - I use GIMP because I'm cheap.  For each frame, you create a new transparent layer and trace over the bits of the frame that you want to replicate.  There's a bit of artistic choice in here about how much detail you want to include and how much colour filling you'll do.   But the most basic thing is to create a simplified line drawing by running the brush over the key elements.\n\nSo for this one of Johnny Rotten, I only took twelve frames from the beginning and only traced his face and the mic and filled in his hair with an approximation of it's actual colour!\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmZ5i1Sv2xYzQEWccL9VZVNoo56jv6xNMUxjbjnS7V7S9A'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmZ5i1Sv2xYzQEWccL9VZVNoo56jv6xNMUxjbjnS7V7S9A'/></a><a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/Qmaxqs77D6je2acPPF8FhdghAcAV9akbkRTpGdXY4jbZKn'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/Qmaxqs77D6je2acPPF8FhdghAcAV9akbkRTpGdXY4jbZKn'/></a>\n\nIf you give your transparent layer a white background you've then got a finished frame for your clip.  So export it and give it a number so that you know which order it goes in.  Again, Photoshop and GIMP probably have this built in, but I'm awkward that way and like to make things as close to \"by hand\" as I can.  This is also much slower, but it does feel like you've made something rather than just knowing which buttons to press.\n\nYou then sew the frames back up into a GIF file using ImageMagick's convert command - check out that [blog post again](\"https://room208.org/blog/posts/48793543478.html\") for the deep dive details.\n\nAlternatively you can take a still image and just trace it several times.  That's what I did with this one of Louis Armstrong.  Four frames, each slightly different from the others, when animated give it this jiggly quality as if he is playing.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmXUay7uUTx44JaaiEEzFLoCeAqLAfxoD4cv24SWA8MkqA'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmXUay7uUTx44JaaiEEzFLoCeAqLAfxoD4cv24SWA8MkqA'/></a>\n\nI'd love to see what other people make of this technique.  Show me your work too!",

It has been the battle ground for many groups of people. One group of people though have had a rather large voice in it, those being the deeply religious and gullible. \n\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2016/08/20/09/46/magnifying-glass-1607160_960_720.jpg\n\nConservapedia is a encyclopedia type website tasked with presenting the other side of the story. They have been on the forefront of the age of the Earth dispute for some time. Their motto is, \"The trustworthy encyclopedia\" but is this really true to any extent? Lets look at their page on the age of the Earth, http://www.conservapedia.com/Age_of_the_Earth\n\n### They claim is that the earth is about 6,000 years old.\n\nThe first thing that they claim is that the earth is about 6,000 years old. They say that historical and much scientific evidence point to that age strongly. One example being that dating substances through radioactive decay is not a valid because the assumption that radioactive decay is constant is wrong. This is just blatantly incorrect. The claim that it is an assumption is really facts backed with testing at least to a limited degree of accuracy. Even with rigorous testing to alter the decay rates of elements no substantial change has ever been detected. Even in the Oklo reactor which was a natural nuclear fission reactor that was active for a few hundred thousand years has had no change on  the Sommerfeld's constant and neutron capture for almost 2 billion years.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nConservapedia makes frequent references archaic texts that have no solid facts backing any of their claims. Their delusional claims take into account little if not any real world facts. They present biased and fudged data as reliable information for profound question and answered. I conclusion they are so detached reality that I am surprised that anybody would take them seriously, and the fact that they are even able to upkeep a website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Sources:\nwww.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CF/CF210.html\npixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2016/08/20/09/46/magnifying-glass-1607160_960_720.jpg\neoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/57000/57723/globe_west_2048.jpg",

Future owners will receive dividends from transaction fees paid to BlockPay.<br>\nThe pre-ICO was done in 3 stages:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1st \u2014 exchange of OPENPOS for BLOCKPAY at the rate of 1.2 to 1 (fund of 600,000 tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>2nd \u2014 sale of BLOCKPAY at the price of 0.000288 BTC (fund of 1.4 mln tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>3rd \u2014 sale of BLOCKPAY at the price of 0.000360 BTC (fund of 3 mln tokens)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The distribution of tokens is as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1.5% \u2014 marketing for pre-ICO</li>\n  <li>5% \u2014 pre-ICO</li>\n  <li>0.9% \u2014 early adopters</li>\n  <li>1.8% \u2014 advisors and partners</li>\n  <li>3.6% \u2014 marketing</li>\n  <li>7.2% \u2014 developers reward</li>\n  <li>80% \u2014 upcoming ICO in 2017</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The platform development plan:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The release of BlockPay \"S\" app for Android and payment terminals Odoo</li>\n  <li>BlockPay integration with leading payment terminals</li>\n  <li>API Development</li>\n  <li>The addition of a large number of fiat gateway exchanges and Escrow Services</li>\n  <li>The addition of anonymous transactions function</li>\n  <li>The development and release of the ECHO messenger for Android and iOS</li>\n  <li>Development of the first version of the BlockPay \"S\" app for iOS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project looks interesting, given the fact that they claim an integration with the ERP and CRM system<a href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\">Odoo</a> used by 60 thousand companies. The only disturbing thing is the absence of an open source software, and this spoils the whole picture. Transaction payments fee and, consequently, planned cash flow for investors are not sufficiently explained either. It should be kept in mind that this project is centralised, i.e. it belongs to the class of projects that demand trust in the founders and, correspondingly, require a thorough audit of operating activity.<br>\nCrowdsale summary:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Dates: 20 August 2016 \u2014 4 September 2016</li>\n  <li>Raised: ~ $657,000 (1096 BTC)</li>\n  <li>Tokens sold: 3.92 mln</li>\n  <li>Total number of tokens: 100 mln\u0414\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f: 20 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u2014 4 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For detailed information on the crowdsale, see: <a href=\"https://blockpay.ch/newsroom/investor-relations/blockpay-reserves/\">https://blockpay.ch/newsroom/investor-relations/blockpay-reserves/</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/BlockPay\">https://cyber.fund/system/BlockPay</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/AntShares\"><strong>AntShares</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>The project is interesting primarily due to the fact that it will be implemented using the Hyperledger platform.

Two funding campaigns start at the same time in September: the sale of Synereo Ltd shares on <a href=\"https://bnktothefuture.com/\">BnkToTheFuture</a> and of AMP tokens.<br>\nFollowing the first crowdfunding, the distribution of AMP was as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>2.72% (45.8 mln) \u2014 sold during the first crowdsale</li>\n  <li>11.9% (200 mln) \u2014 user rewards</li>\n  <li>8.92% (150 mln) \u2014 reserve for the content creators</li>\n  <li>11.9% (200 mln) \u2014 founders' reward</li>\n  <li>13.68% (230 mln) \u2014 bounty program</li>\n  <li>50.61% (850.4 mln) \u2014 next funding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Synereo revised their plans and now aim to develop a protocol similar to the <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/MaidSafeCoin\">SAFE Network</a>, which will include the following <a href=\"https://www.synereo.com/learn-more/\">components</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm</li>\n  <li>Distributed network of nodes connected on the principle of \"shards\", where blockchain is divided into many small segments</li>\n  <li>Distributed repository</li>\n  <li>Smart contracts</li>\n  <li>Social layer (a social network motivated according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/synereo/synereo.github.io/raw/master/whitepapers/synereo.pdf\">Attention</a> Economy Model)</li>\n  <li>The possibility of building distributed apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The grant program for dApps developers <a href=\"https://www.synereo.com/developers/\">Project 11</a> with a budget of 1.11 million AMP is already in operation.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The popular website <a href=\"http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/synereo/\">CoinMarketCap</a> misleadingly states current Synereo capitalisation at about $10-13 million, which is not true because it is only the cost of 62,580,000 AMP (3.72%) in circulation on the market. According to <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Synereo\">cyber \u2022 Fund</a>'s calculations, with the total of <a href=\"http://omnichest.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=39\">1.68 billion</a> tokens, Synereo's real capitalisation reaches $300 million.</p>\n<p>It has not been disclosed yet how many tokens will be put up for sale, but we can assume that the minimum amount claimed by Synereo is about $130-140 million in case the entire reserve is sold, which is 850.4 mln AMP. This is a very ambitious plan, taking into account current distribution and the market price of tokens. Besides, it should be kept in mind that after the launch of the network, additional 5% of AMP will be emitted every year. In my opinion, they should sell the whole reserve without fixed prices and with token distribution proportional to investments.

Deals in the film and TV industry are the most difficult to arrange as they often involve hundreds of individual participants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u25cf On-demand video content portal (TVOD)<br>\nTVOD changes the way people watch entertainment programmes. S-DTV is born to create the TVOD portal for original content distribution, as well as for selected and acquired content. In addition to developing an interface on IPFS, S-DTV will use third-party portals such as GooglePlay, AppleTV iTunes and Vimeo to build a larger audience in a short time.</p>\n<p>Minimum investment goal \u2013 $500,000.</p>\n<p>Desirable funding \u2013 $7,5 mln.</p>\n<p>According to S-DTV documentation, Swiss company MME has developed a new, innovative organisational structure specifically for S-DTV: the Centralised Organised Distributed Company (CODE). It is the Swiss company, therefore, that will manage the finances and reinvest the income, while tokens will be used for paying out the dividends.</p>\n<p>Token distribution:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>400 mln Singular DTV GMBH</li>\n  <li>100 mln core investors</li>\n  <li>500 mln crowdsale</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Funds distribution in case if $7,5 mln is raised:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\"Singular\" season 1 (3 episodes of the mini-series): $3.25 mln</li>\n  <li>Documentary division: $0.50 mln</li>\n  <li>Development of the rights management platform: $2 mln</li>\n  <li>TVOD portal development: $1 mln</li>\n  <li>Marketing: $0.50 mln</li>\n  <li>Administrative, legal expenses and unforeseen circumstances: $0.25 mln</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crowdfunding is planned for September and will likely take place at Devcon2.</p>\n<p>The Ethereum and Consensys founder Joseph Lubin is included into the team as CTO.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in this project tokens only serve for distribution of dividends, and the project is centralised because 40% of tokens belong to Singular DTV GMBH. Another disadvantage is the fact that of the four declared founders/directors, only Zach Lebeau will work full time on the project. He is likely to be engaged in the studio rather than in the platform development; there are also risks associated with SEC.</p>\n<p>The main question is the development of the TVOD platform and the rights management platform: there is no understanding as to what kind of team will be working on it, and no technical description at the moment. If both platforms can be really implemented, the project is promising for investment.=</p>\n<p>For detailed information about the project, see: <a href=\"https://singulardtv.com/\">https://singulardtv.com/</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/SingularDTV\">https://cyber.fund/system/SingularDTV</a><br>\n</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/Decent\"><strong>Decent</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>It is designed for creative people, writers, bloggers, journalists and their fans and followers.

The only reservation is that the market is not very vast, albeit actively developing. Besides, the motivation for developers and other market players is not very well thought through. In this regard, central players, who can also use smart contracts and predictions market to confirm the events results, may have an advantage. However, this project may indeed become the market leader on the condition of good community building and active incentivising of referees and the jury.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For detailed information about the project, see: <a href=\"https://firstblood.io/\">https://firstblood.io/</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/FirstBlood\">https://cyber.fund/system/FirstBlood</a><br>\n</p>\n<h2><br>\n<a href=\"https://ico.mass.network/#/\"><strong>MassNetwork</strong></a><br>\n</h2>\n<p>The three main entities:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Advertisers</li>\n  <li>Websites</li>\n  <li>Internet users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The basic principle is to follow the industry's trend to monetise customer attention and create a convenient and fair trading platform for all parties involved, including Internet users. Mass allows users to receive instant rewards for web surfing through the built-in p2p infrastructure based on the blockchain. As a result, advertisers will pay users a fair price for their attention and data without intermediaries.<br>\n</p>\n<p>An increasing number of customers are using ad-blocking software. Mass offers a browser extension and a mobile app that can block ads as well as protect personal data. Yet, their primary goal is not blocking but rather improving users' experience with advertising and rewarding them with cryptocurrency to establish a consumer-advertiser relationship and, therefore, reduce the number of ad-block users. Mass will also have a cryptocurrency wallet and blockchain-based payment system.</p>\n<p>Crowdsale dates: 6 September \u2014 1 December 2016</p>\n<p>Token distribution:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>70% to the crowdsale participants</li>\n  <li>30% to Mass team members</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mass plans to build its own full-blown infrastructure for advertising industry with an internal token. A similar solution has been already introduced to the market \u2013 the Brave browser. It blocks default ads and replaces it with incentivising ad materials. The bitcoins received from advertisers are distributed among users, the platform and the endorsing website. In my opinion, if Mass used smart contracts or a proprietary blockchain enabling further token emission to incentivise users and websites, they could compete with bitcoin. However, Mass token works on the bitcoin blockchain, which on the one hand makes it very secure, but on the other, has no advantage over bitcoin per se. In favour of bitcoin are accessibility, recognition, and a more stable price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Crowdsale takes place here: <a href=\"https://ico.mass.network/#/?aid=ep6oxa\">https://ico.mass.network/#/?aid=ep6oxa</a><br>\nFor useful links and more information, go to: <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/system/MassNetwork\">https://cyber.fund/system/MassNetwork</a></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>All data and calculations are quoted as of 6 September 2016 with bitcoin price at $609.

These are both very small niche interests, and they very likely will never get a lot of response.  I do not provide value for the reading time of most people when I write in these areas.  Mental health versus booze?  THAT is a good experiment!\n\nThe recipe for Hot Buttered Rum was the clear winner, I think I reeled in a Whale within the 1st 15 minutes.  This was the second time I  made more than a  few dollars, but this was a little more than a buck by a bit!  Why is that?  Butter is good, sweet is good, rum is good.  People like those things.\n\nSo the moral?  Write and post for yourself FIRST.  I enjoyed writing both posts.  But if you want to make money from a market, you have to provide value to that market.    You don't need to spend all day baiting Whales, but an occasional attempt to identify market trends and appeal to what the voter wants is not going to kill the artiste or the prophet within you.  I said in the last paragraph that MOST folks won't read about the politics of security  or about Gridcoin?  I still write on these things, and there are some folks that come by and visit  (thank yall, btw!)\n\nAlso, consider that there is a luck of the draw.  If the person that your post has value for does not see it, new posts are taking the position for curator upvoting.  Remember that curators are rewarded on thier voting prowess, which does not necessarily mean the post was good.  Did you write a great post that nobody read?  Write a followup!\n\nFinally, there MAY be a value issue with articles that take too long to read...I don't know about that, so I'm going to shut up now '>",

    "body": "### <center>These photos were taken in July, 2016 at sunrise.</center>\n\n<center>![Sunrise at Buccaneer Bay by Meredith Loughran](https://merej99.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/bucbay1-e1473966204550.jpg)\nTaken with a Canon Powershot SX1 IS</center><br>\n# The story behind the shot\nIn July, 2016, due to a series of unfortunate events, I was faced with eviction with no immediate place to go.  \n\nWe begged and borrowed from any place we could and managed to have a little money in the bank - just not enough to save our house.  We were out of time and needed to make some hard decisions.\n\nWhat I soon found out was once residents are served eviction papers in Florida, you have 24 hours to get out of the house.  ***24 hours!***\n\nSitting between a rock and a hard place, we had secured a moving truck and a storage unit.  \n\n### We make a great team\nMy husband and I have been through so much adversity throughout our relationship.  Death in the family, job loss, the dynamics of raising kids and dealing with my poisonous ex-husband, moving, starting a business, closing the business, cars repossessed...  Pretty much anything that could test the strength of our marriage is what we went through.\n\nSometimes I think back and go: *How does this keep happening?*  What decisions are we making that keep us stuck in this terrible cycle of unfortunate events?\n\n#### We balance each other\nMy husband is high-strung where I've learned to be grounded and stable.  So the higher he goes, the lower I go.  Do you know what I mean?\n\nIf he's bouncing off the walls and completely stressed, I remain still and calm.  So if he's a skyscraper, I'm the basement foundation.  I'll let him reach for the skies but I keep him grounded and pull him back down to earth too.\n\nConversely, when I'm too low and feel like I can't take another step, he lifts me up.  He is my soul provider.  Maybe being casual friends for 20 years before we began dating has something to do with it.  There are no secrets between us, which also means we have the freedom of expression without being crucified for having opposing views sometimes.\n\n## Facing homelessness\nEven though there is a 24 hour eviction, a few benefits of living in Florida includes decent weather.  You can camp all year without fear of dying from exposure or hypothermia.  Available houses are everywhere and you can generally get into them rather quickly.\n\nAs things generally go with my husband and I, nothing happens easily.  Well...  Okay, that's not entirely true.  ***If things are meant to be, they come very easily*** but when we try to force something, it becomes impossible and we may as well be knocking our heads against a brick wall.  LOL  \n<center>![Fek it, we're Irish - from Pixabay](http://scribblingbandits.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fekit-ur-irish.jpg)\nimage source: pixabay</center>\n\n<br>\nMy husband was doing his usual pacing when I said, \"I've got an idea and I want you to hear me out.\"\n\nI had been doing some online research and found a local motel that could accommodate 3 people and pets.  Being off-season in Florida, the weekly rate was under $500.  But spending $500 meant that it was $500 less in the bank for a security deposit should we find a place to go.\n\nIt took him about an hour to say, \"Do it.\"\n\nLiterally working through the day and night to get our things off property, we got everything out but my bucket garden and potted blueberry bush.\n\n### We've got a week to find a home\nEven through all of this, I remained calm - almost peaceful.  Good things happen for us when we don't force it and the stars align.  So I just my faith out to the universe and knew that no matter what, we would work hard and we would be provided for.\n\n<center>***Sometimes you just have to put positive vibes out there and hope for a good return.***</center>\n\nBeing in the motel meant free wi-fi so we were pretty diligent about home searches.  We looked at a few properties and quickly rejected them.  Mind you, we don't look at the cosmetics of a house - stuff that can be cleaned or painted; we look at the bones of the house - water pump, electric panel, roof, walls, floor...\n\nMost of the housing we looked at didn't even have good bones or were located in seriously bad neighborhoods.  We don't require a lot but we do have our limits.\n\nOne week turned into two.  Luckily my husband is employed full time, but we were eating through our savings.  I cut costs where I could, like the food budget.  With nothing but a little microwave in the room, I kept our daily food budget down to about $10 a day to feed 3 adults.  Living conditions included one room with 2 queen-sized beds, 3 adults, 2 dogs and 4 ferrets.\n#### But it wasn't so bad!\nWe didn't have neighbors in the rooms next to us.  We had free wi-fi and access to the pool.  The cleaning ladies were polite and kept us in clean towels and toilet paper.  Most importantly, we had a roof over our head and food in our belly.\n\nI have a hard time saying we actually *were* homeless because we weren't living out of our car.  We had niceties.  But at the same time we weren't there because we were on vacation, you know?  There was no other place to go.\n\n**BONUS: Our room faced east for stunning sunrises like this.**\n\n<center>![Sunrise over Buccaneer Bay wide view by Meredith Loughran](https://merej99.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/bucbay2-e1473966000877.jpg)\nA wider view of sunrise over Buccaneer Bay</center>\n\n## And then the stars began to align\nWith 3 more days left in week two, I admit I was beginning to stress a little.  ***Ya think?!?***\nAnd then we got the call.  There's a house available as long as we can commit to a six-month lease.  And because my husband had helped them with some of their plumbing problems in the past, they were willing to stretch out the security deposit over a few of his paychecks.  **A stepping stone.**\n\nIn that time a friend of mine introduced me to #Steemit\n\nSo here we are, in a 'stepping stone' house, recovering from the last series of unfortunate events.\nCall me crazy, but I feel truly blessed.\n\n> To quote from the movie ***Bridge of Spies, 2015***\n> James Donovan: \"Do you *ever* worry?\"\n> Rudolph Abel: \"Would it help?\"\n\n### <center>Well, would it?</center>\n-----\n### Wall of #Steemit love:\nThis awesome name in peppers was created by @papa-pepper: ![@papa-pepper made my name in peppers!

The dog already more big came out of the House and my neighbour had that go it to search 4 times, until is was to another city to live by to time and not could return be pending of she.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_20160816_1803333cf0d.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160816_1803333cf0d.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n<p>Dana was on the street and not brought it over to his house.

Makes 3 days entered in zeal by them calculations this would be its first zeal, it worrying is that there are several dogs that it have mounted and of have a delivery would be very risky, by the situation of disease and malnutrition of which is leaving, apart that would be other litter more than puppies that would enter to the situation of street.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_20160912_173902731c2.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160912_173902731c2.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n<p>All the funds raised in this post will be dedicated to their sterilization and to their treatment.

Voy a comenzar con la historia de una perrita que me ha conmovido, y en mis pr\u00f3ximos post, les voy contando la historia de cada uno de los 24 perros que estamos protegiendo y alimentando gracias a steemit\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/animalrescue34001a.jpg\" alt=\"animalrescue34001a.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n\nElla es Dana una de las perras que habita en la carrera 3 de mi vecindario la he estado alimentando desde hace m\u00e1s de 2 meses, no tengo fecha exacta de cuando comenc\u00e9 pero ella fue la primera perra que me incentivo a comenzar esta labor en mi vecindario, su estado de desnutrici\u00f3n me estaba afectando.\n\nNo entiendo como hay gente que es incapaz de dejarle al menos los sobros de la comida al perro que vive en la calle, en mi cuadra hay perros de la calle y entre todos los vecinos los alimentamos con comida de sal, con los restos o incluso les dejamos un plato completo de comida, no fue necesario incluirlos a la campa\u00f1a de alimentaci\u00f3n porque los mantenemos en buena forma incluso duermen en el porche de alguna casas, se podr\u00eda decir que los adoptaron.\n\nCon Dana las cosas han sido distintas, conozco incluso al vecino que la sac\u00f3 a la calle, me cont\u00f3 que la sacaron de la casa  de una vecina en enero porque ella ya no pod\u00eda tenerla y la adoptaron, a medida que fue creciendo se enferm\u00f3 al parecer de parasitosis ya que vomitaba todo lo que com\u00eda, aparte le dio sarna. La perrita ya m\u00e1s crecidita sal\u00eda de la casa y se iba a la de los vecinos y mi vecino tuvo que irla a buscar 4 veces, hasta que se fue a otra ciudad a vivir por un tiempo y no pudo volver estar pendiente de ella.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_20160816_1803333cf0d.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160816_1803333cf0d.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n\nDana qued\u00f3 en la calle y no la trajeron m\u00e1s a su casa. El vecino dice \u201cLa perra se estaba enfermando en mi casa, hay una enfermedad en las paredes que todo perro que llega se muere, le da diarrea tres d\u00edas y muere, mi mam\u00e1 no pod\u00eda cuidarla m\u00e1s, la dejamos en la calle ah\u00ed est\u00e1 mejor y m\u00e1s sana que en mi casa\u201d he comprobado que mi vecino tiene raz\u00f3n todo perro que llega a su casa se enferma y muere si es cachorro, presumimos que en su casa habita la bacteria Parvovirus, es triste esta situaci\u00f3n pero igual no lo justifico.\n\nEsta perrita se le calcula apenas un a\u00f1o tiene una personalidad alegre y agradecida siempre que me ve me saluda con mucho cari\u00f1o mueve su cola y su amor es incomparable, puede acompa\u00f1arme por toda la urbanizaci\u00f3n cuando salgo, es una fiel compa\u00f1era, de lo que se perdieron sus due\u00f1os, es una perra muy carism\u00e1tica y tierna.. Hace 3 d\u00edas entr\u00f3 en celo por los c\u00e1lculos, este ser\u00eda su primer celo, lo preocupante es que hay varios perros que la  han montado y de tener un parto ser\u00eda muy arriesgado, por la situaci\u00f3n de enfermedad y desnutrici\u00f3n en la que est\u00e1, aparte que ser\u00eda otra camada m\u00e1s cachorros que entrar\u00edan a la situaci\u00f3n de calle.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/IMG_20160912_173902731c2.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160912_173902731c2.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n\nTodos los fondos recaudados en este post se dedicar\u00e1n a su esterilizaci\u00f3n y su tratamiento.

I will not get into details of what they did to her because it was horrifying to say the least. I closed my eyes and tears were just streaming down my cheeks. They kept saying \u201c<strong>Open your eyes and watch, because you\u2019re next</strong>\u201d. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/bw4vrm7tr/bound_and_gagged.jpg\" width=\"289\" height=\"320\"/></p>\n<p>After about twenty minutes or so, which felt like a full day to me, they threw me back into the room and I panicked. I worked feverishly on that window trying to open it. I was aware that the only way I was going to escape this horror was to jump out of that window but it had to be done without breaking it. &nbsp;If I broke the window, they\u2019d surely hear me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the dresser was an old metal comb that I used to pry the nails up. This method worked, it allowed me to loosen the nails and wiggle them back and forth until they could be pulled out by hand. Luckily there were only three nails or I would have never been able to get that window open. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I jumped out of the window and ran bare foot without looking back once. I ran through ditches along the highway, knowing that if they were out looking for me I needed to stay low. This was no easy task since I had no shoes on, but my life depended on my getting away as quickly as I could. Eventually I made my way to the road, stuck my thumb out, luckily I was picked up pretty fast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When we got into town I asked them to take me to my friend Theresa\u2019s house, I knew she would have a change of clothes and shoes for me. After changing and getting cleaned up I had no idea what I was going to do, because I knew they would be out looking for me. They obviously found Ann, and it was a matter of time before they found me again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I ended up calling an old boyfriend, Frank, and asked if he could take me to Edmonton and he agreed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A valuable lesson was learned, when parents tell you something is bad, or should be avoided, it is usually for good reason. I should have listened. When you are young, you think you know everything and will do what you want without thinking about the possible consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/7c73d0mbz/overflowing_suitcase.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"220\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I had only one small suitcase with some clothes my girlfriend gave me. Frank came and got me and we drove five hours to Edmonton. Once there I went back to the area where I knew people. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was when I met Miguel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Miguel was Portuguese and tanned and seemed like such a nice guy. I liked him instantly, I thought we would end up as great friends, but as it turned out, he ended up being my boyfriend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Miguel introduced his sister in law Doris to me. Quickly I ended up moving in with her as a roommate. Now this was already a disturbing time in my life and it wasn't about to get any better. &nbsp;&nbsp;A friendship from hell was born, and I will explain why. &nbsp;Doris was married with a child, living separate from her husband and daughter, because she could not control her hormones and had many affairs. &nbsp;She wore mostly mens clothing that were all too baggy for her. Her hair was long and blond and she stood maybe four inches taller then me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She told me the story as to why she was living away from her child. She and Miguel were at Doris\u2019s home one day, while her husband was at work. One thing led to another and the two of them ended up in bed together. Her husband, Terry, came home, and found the front door was double locked and he could not get into the apartment. She refused to let him in. Her daughter was in the crib crying with all of the commotion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/6egwz52ih/cryingbaby.jpg\" width=\"170\" height=\"136\"/></p>\n<p>Her husband went back to his car and waited in the parking lot before trying again. &nbsp;In a hurry to get out before &nbsp;Terry came back, Doris and Miguel packed up a bag, and both of them had left the apartment leaving the crying toddler behind, unattended. &nbsp;Several hours passed, and Terry figured he\u2019d try again. As soon as he reached the apartment door, he could hear his daughter wailing. He was luckily able to get into the apartment this time and he ran to pick up his sobbing daughter and carried her around looking for his wife. She was nowhere to be found.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank &nbsp;you for your support and continued reading.</p>\n<p>If you missed the beginning of my book you can find it here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/writing/@feline1991/a-steemit-original-a-lifetime-of-seeking-happiness-part-1\">https://steemit.com/writing/@feline1991/a-steemit-original-a-lifetime-of-seeking-happiness-part-1</a> &nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

But if that still isnt enough you can allwasy add 2 extra battery modules, or 1  and 3 other modules *depending on what module you want to add*.\n\nThere are 12 modules available at this moment but there are more to come, there is word that there is going to be a module to communicate without the need of a GSM connection.\n\nI could go on and on about this amazing product but sadly enough we have to wait until Q1 of 2017 before it will actually ship and until that time I will keep watching the news about *Nexpaq*\n\nFor more information go to *Nexpaq* and see what you would like them to add as a module, the're looking for some input!\n**[Nexpaq.com](http://nexpaq.com)**",

What has come to my mind, it to take pictures in black-and-white option as it was in early 70-80 years when the photo has only arisen.\n\nThe place for shootings have chosen the central park. Weather was cool. Have agreed about a meeting. At first the girl hesitated, and it has turned out on a shot here so\n<center>\nhttps://pp.vk.me/c836320/v836320641/185/NYRpq9qzo9w.jpg\n</center>\n<center>\nhttps://pp.vk.me/c836320/v836320641/169/iPi41rP501o.jpg\n</center>\nAfter we have spent more than 30 minutes of shootings, the girl was liberated, and has begun to work actively.\n<center>\nhttps://pp.vk.me/c836320/v836320641/17e/eU5naYLtgEw.jpg\n<br>\nhttps://pp.vk.me/c836320/v836320641/177/XNZ-jrBAvOA.jpg\n</center>\n\nGood impressions remained with me and my model.

I\u2019m a 22 years old girl, student at a Dental Medicine University and a Makeup Artist. This is a weird combination, because I won\u2019t be able to do both of them at the same time and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019ll have to choose. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/42b9a9a3942fc7c3149f7175e25cdcb0.png\" width=\"419\" height=\"452\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I want to tell you something about my hobbies. &nbsp;I like Photography. A good friend of mine, was a student at Photography and she needed me for many times to be a model for her projects. So, yes, I like to be a model, even I\u2019m short (1.55 m).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Photography, I like to do many DIY things for decoration, storage or for wearing. I love listening to a lot of music, especially Rihanna\u2019s music (as I told you, I\u2019m obsessed with her).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another weird hobby of mine, is to collect things. I have a collection of napkins ( I don\u2019t know the number of them), perfumes bottles (over 150), and also I have a lot of things with Rihanna (magazines, perfumes, albums, a doll, posters, body lotions).Maybe it\u2019s not a \u201ccollection\u201d but I like to say, that it is.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/70867617eddfe2f460a16ae718c14956.png\" width=\"466\" height=\"454\"/></p>\n<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>&nbsp;I love..</strong></em>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love &nbsp;Makeup! I can say this everyday! I want to push myself to be one of the top Makeup Artists from the world. And dreaming. I love to dream, so this is my biggest dream. I love chocolate, roses, cats, walks, my friends, my family, to be myself, to be happy, coffee with milk, to make my clients happy and I love to share my thoughts with you (I just discovered this). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/ffcf90e4038e4d76cfa5dc782de63edd.png\" width=\"289\" height=\"456\"/></p>\n<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I\u2019m afraid of..&nbsp;</strong></em></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm..

One that threatens the health of several men, specially those that are undergoing that wonderful stage full of pimples, irregular beards and systematic rejection to anything that comes from their parents except money. Even if <strong>there protoadults are the population group with more risk of facing this demon, almost every male is a victim from this situation at least once in life</strong>. This enemy made of fear and lack of resolution is not the first drunkenness on vodka you got, neither that time you got caught trying to asphyxiate your personal fowl. Nothing like that.</p>\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2015/06/06/07/36/heart-799138_960_720.jpg\n<p>You're that guy, that teen around 16 years old and just got a girlfriend of around your same age. Out of nowhere, you're not the same. Your friends stop paying you a visit, you don't show up to do sports as you used to before, not to mention that you don't hang out with them in the Saturday nights. <strong>Because of her, again. Always her. </strong>Your friends get a bit mad at you and they have their reasons, but there's always a cool one that mentions: \"you just envy that he gets laid, let him copulate in peace!\". Yes, he knows, hit the nail, he totally understands the reasons why <strong>a 16 year old teen craves more the sheets than to prepare the Playstation,</strong> he spends more time with his girlfriend than with his friends. Obviously, this is an invented story, because when I was 16 I still played hide and seek and glued my snots under the table; two things I almost stopped doing by now.</p>\n<p>What your friends do not know is that <strong>you had to leave behind SEVERAL Saturday nights</strong> to reach what you were committed to, lets be sincere, at the end of the day the \"yes, I want\" from your side is obvious. But is the female whom holds the real power. <strong>They hold the goods to display in offer to our permanent demands</strong>, at least at that age (HA!). Bunch of nights of just \"making out\". Months and even years for some (that, or I had serious issues defining a situation then). Your friends could be great soccer players, but they'll never understand how it feels to make it to the goal, pass the goalkeeper, and not score because she says \"it's not the right moment\".</p>\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2016/07/21/15/41/no-1532844_960_720.jpg\n<p>In a wonderful crescendo of fantasy and metaphor, it is essential to break the dream and put a name to this Boxer short's Sauron, that guy that should not be named in the sacred halls of the bedroom is nothing but a <strong>haploid overload</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>When \"the game\" starts a lot of physiologic processes are triggered, attempting to enhance the performance</strong> in the bed / couch / car / field / airplanebathroom / bullshitairplanebathroomsaretoosmallandnobodyenjoysdoingitthere. Cardiac frequency and arterial pressure increase while at the same time <strong>blood vessels dilate</strong> (veins, mainly) at the entire genital area. This McCombo leads into <strong>blood accumulation in the sexual organs</strong> as long as the stimulation persists, because once the orgasm is reached, blood vessels recover their original size and blood drains away from the area.</p>\n<p>BUUUUUUUUUUUUT (this is what feeds the demon), when there's no orgasm and you're halfway there, <strong>the nervous signals that tell your body to \"stop and let go already\" are not there</strong> as a result blood stays there, leaving your balls literally swollen along with the always enjoyable sensation of bearing two watermelons in between your legs. We should mention that having to watermelons hanging from your hipbone hurt. Some are lucky and only hurt for a small time, others... are not so lucky (we wish you luck, dear friend).</p>\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2012/02/26/11/04/ball-17133_960_720.jpg\n<p><em>Where did the 3rd one come from?</em></p>\n<p>Despite being something amazingly frequent, <strong>we know nothing about this pain caused for not finishing what you started</strong>. There's little evidence and bibliography is very limited; only anecdotic info. Some medics had the brilliant idea of calling it <strong><em>blue balls</em></strong><strong> (slang)</strong><em>,</em> because when oxygen-less blood accumulates at the scrotum the area starts tinting into the tone of the smurfs. Some surveys were ran at professional environments and all knew the topic, yet nothing shows at medicine books. So, <strong>a clear cause is also unknown</strong>. All we have is \"knowledge\" based on basic reasoning over what we know about physiology in humans; just imagine the poor volunteer that'd go into a lab so that some white overall jerks study him by not letting him finish.</p>\n<p>Another reason for this lack of info is that <strong>the treatment is rather simple, we all know it</strong> and there's no need of highly specialized doctors to perform it... You guessed it finish what you started, solo mode; because if you don't it can be a pain that lasts hours until the blood vessels recover their original size.</p>\n<p>This time, medicine based on evidence, only real guru, confirms nothing else but folklore:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A bird in the hand is worth two in the blue.</p>\n</blockquote>\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2013/02/27/14/34/brent-goose-86582_960_720.jpg\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you liked this post and its informal way of talking about sciences, please, follow me for more!</p>\n<p>Leave a comment either for good or for bad reviews.

Its half formed little arm sensually traces the spot where a bundle of greasy black hoses passes through its skin, puffy and red all around it. \u201cI have...things...coming out of my body too.\u201d\n\nA baby\u2019s scream pierces the thick, humid air, barely discernible over a loud siren. Shattered glass cylinders all around, revealed sporadically in silhouette by flickering lights. Men in gas masks travel down the rows with hammers, smashing the cylinders that are still intact, spilling their contents into the ever-deepening soup. \n\nThe screaming suddenly stops. I search frantically for some explanation but cannot get up. My limbs, feeble imitations of what they should be, splash the foetal muck about but do nothing to move me. \n\nA maddening itching sensation surrounds the points on my chest where black hoses penetrate into it, but I haven\u2019t the fingers with which to scratch. \u201cIt\u2019s...not supposed to be this way\u201d I sputter. It looks at once quizzical and mournful. \u201cOh? How is it\u2026\u2019supposed\u2019 to be?\u201d\n\nAnother loud smash, and a baby\u2019s wail. The men with the hammers abruptly silence it, moving methodically down the rows. My tears mix freely with the amniotic fluid as one of the uniformed men, drenched in it from the waist down, arrives at our row.\n\n\u201cYou know\u201d the bulbous headed creature with the malformed little arm coos, \u201cI always thought you were pretty.\u201d It reaches over with its distorted, knobbly paw and caresses my ribcage. \u201cI would\u2019ve said something, but we were in different tanks.\u201d I recoil from his touch, shuddering as the man with the hammer finally reaches me.",

There, I was with fifteen other souls, all of us intently hammering away at solving the world\u2019s problems in a nice quite \u201cstudy-hall\u201d environment.  Suddenly the placid quietude was shattered by one person initiating a video conference with several colleagues, sans headphones.  She and her colleagues talked and laughed loudly; completely oblivious to the fact that they were disrupting everyone around them.\n\nFrom the dark looks, loud sighs and other non-verbal communication, it was obvious that everyone was annoyed.  I managed to survive about seven minutes of her auditory assault before summoning the will to approach her with a bleeding edge new concept\u2026 headphones.  I have captured the essence of the exchange below.\n\n\u2022\t**the-ultimatum** (**TU**)\n\u2022\t**Rude Shrew** (**RS**)\n\n> \u2022\t**TU**: \u201cWould you like to borrow these?\u201d\n \n_I extend my arm out revealing a set of headphones with a built in mic._\n> \u2022\t**RS**: [incoherent stammering while she tried to ignore me.  She responds to her colleagues]\n\n_I sweep the room with my extended arm_\n> \u2022\t**TU**: \u201cWe are all trying to work\u2026 you are more than welcome to these\u201d\n\n_She turns to me with a look of utter confusion_\n> \u2022\t**RS**: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to use those.\u201d\n\n_A lifetime of training in self-control is being challenged in this solitary moment.  A look of incredulity sweeps over my face_\n> \u2022\t**TU**: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to plug-in and put on headphones\u2026?\u201d\n\n_[End of conversation.]_\n\n**As she continued to interrupt everyone I started to do some research and below is the content of this post.**\n\n**A Step-by-Step Guide to: Remotely Shutdown a Computer on a Shared Network**\nFollowing the steps & screenshots below you will find a very fast very simple way to boot users off a shared network or play pranks on your friends. \n\n\u2022\tFind the **cmd** prompt & _run as admin_\n\u2022\tType the command: **net view**\n\nThis will show you all the names of computers on the same network.

    "body": "# Making of a sculpture:\n\n Pearl The Whale.\n\nThis is something I was working on for the past week along other things, I had a lot of fun out of the process I learned a couple of things as well but overall it was something I will try again probably in the future.\n So here she comes again, the Queen of all seven seas. Isn't she a beauty?\n\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/80bc2d561d6b165be7ad8630f1f43051.png\n\n## Stage 1:\n Modeling foam, glued together or stack it with some toothpicks like I did. \nMaking my initial shape with a knife, I am keep working till I get a shape I can work with.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/falainitsastage15f666.jpg\n\n## Stage 2\n\nApplying clay over the modeling foam. The clay must be treated with water, work it out in your hands to soften it then apply it over your model, do not make it thinner than 1 mm as it will crack while it dries out.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/8912ae9b97d2bcd581aadefb82e7ea1d.jpg\n\n## Stage 3\n\nRefining and creating details, use a sharp tool to sharpen the surface of your model. Use some water to clean up your tools every now and then, it helps the most when you are working with clay to have clean and wet tools to work out.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/falainitsastage294837.jpg\n\n## Stage 4\n\nCuring process. Allow your clay model to complete dry out. It will take approximately 24 hours for this procedure to occur.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/falainitsastage35b415.jpg\n\n## Stage 5\n\nPainting your model. I used casual temperas colors, you can use acrylics or sprays. It all comes down to what you are aiming for as an end result so it is a matter of preference. Congrats your sculpture is ready it is time for some photo shooting.\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/final3cab50.jpg\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/final25f3cb.jpg\n\nI hope you like the end result.\nI sure did. It now decorates a shelf on my bedroom I will call her the Ocean Pearl I was going for Marianda but she is simple not fat enough for that...\n@ned @dan @smooth @berniesanders @blocktrades @itsascam @andeverywhale out thereI hope you get a giggle out of this. I have made this as mean to go to the Amsterdam steemfest and get some of my fellows with him. Please enjoy.\n\n\nThank you all for your support\nI will include some high res photos for you to check out the final sculpture\n\nhttps://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/15/c6049e3fffe58f0a25d8c9b9433fbdb1.png\n\nFollow me \n@skapaneas",

This is not to equate the actions of our current government to the Nazis, but that is the literal origin of that quote. It's from the Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. \n\"So when we hear modern politicians, modern people repeating that reflexively without confronting its origins, what it really stands for, I think that's harmful. \n\"And if we actually think about it, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Because privacy isn\u2019t about something to hide. Privacy is about something to protect. That\u2019s who you are. That's what you believe in. Privacy is the right to a self. Privacy is what gives you the ability to share with the world who you are on your own terms. For them to understand what you\u2019re trying to be and to protect for yourself the parts of you you\u2019re not sure about, that you\u2019re still experimenting with. \n\"If we don\u2019t have privacy, what we\u2019re losing is the ability to make mistakes, we\u2019re losing the ability to be ourselves. Privacy is the fountainhead of all other rights. Freedom of speech doesn\u2019t have a lot of meaning if you can\u2019t have a quiet space, a space within yourself, your mind, your community, your friends, your family, to decide what it is you actually want to say. \n\"Freedom of religion doesn\u2019t mean that much if you can\u2019t figure out what you actually believe without being influenced by the criticisms of outside direction and peer pressure. And it goes on and on. \n\"Privacy is baked into our language, our core concepts of government and self in every way. It\u2019s why we call it 'private property.' Without privacy you don\u2019t have anything for yourself. \n\"So when people say that to me I say back, arguing that you don\u2019t care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is like arguing that you don\u2019t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.\" \n\n\n<center> ![EdSnow](https://i.gyazo.com/e61df2c9f69db5c5c8c318fbffdcf577.jpg) </center>\n\nWatch this film. \n\n[--IJST](https://steemit.com/@imjustsayintho/)",

    "body": "# A new focus\nby @robyneggs, business strategist and artist in PDX\n___\n### The inward focus shift\nThe equilibrium of the global economy is in the not-too-distant future. The population is increasing substantially, and the largest segment of the U.S. population will retire soon. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) an economic slow-down will occur around 2020, or less than five years from now, and continue on into 2050, at which time the global economy is predicted to also triple in size (2015)! With that knowledge it must be addressed that the GDP growth of the nation will hence slow, causing businesses to look towards \u201cdeepening\u201d capital within this growth measurement (MIT, 2009). It is important to note what kind of growth is occurring, whether it be in capital, hours, or Total Factors of Production (TFP) (MIT, 2009). For, labor growth alone won\u2019t guarantee a healthy nation (Chien, 2015). To stay on top, therefore, we must \"deepen\" our nation's human capital. And steemit can help.\n### Maximizing focus\nIn order to fully maximize, or deepen output, the nation must first invest in sustainable infrastructure, human capital, and technological advances, for only long term economic strategy will increase the GDP healthfully. Steemit could cover all those bases. Steemit houses a sustainable infrastructure within its free-market governing principles; its focus is the user (or human capital in this example); and it is technologically advanced. Apparently continual growth has more to it than just increasing output. It's not about just posting *any* content, it's about posting content that adds to, or \"deepens\" the worth of steemit, as a whole. Our human capital output (in the form of posts) must sustain itself in the long run. At what point does steemit house all possible how-to articles? At what point does every household in the nation have the products it needs to live? What needs to happen to continue to grow a nation\u2019s GDP value after that? What does steemit need to do to continue to create value after the hard fork?\n### Are businesses (and you) prepared?\nConsidering the economy will soon reach equilibrium, how prepared are we for such an event? Consider that the free market of businesses might only be concerned with the short term effects of economic growth and shock, but what controls will be instituted to carry on efforts when said businesses mature or no longer exist? What about when steemit matures? Continual increased output will simply not be enough, considering the explosion in population growth by 2050. According to Peter Diamandis, a speaker at TED2012, this explosion brings with it an age of abundance; one in which we can expect to see 3 billion new minds (minute 12:07) coming online in the near future. Capital deepening must become the new focus of growth measurement, to guarantee that output per worker increases; that we increase our value as the individual. It is up to us to deepen ourselves and our investments, steemit being the possible infrastructure of deliverance.\n![safe4a451.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/17/safe4a451.png)\n### Adapting and policy\nNew economic policy must therefore become endogenous. \n> What is the 'Endogenous Growth Theory'\nThe endogenous growth theory is an economic theory which argues that economic growth is generated from within a system as a direct result of internal processes. More specifically, the theory notes that the enhancement of a nation's human capital will lead to economic growth by means of the development of new forms of technology and efficient and effective means of production. -Investopedia\n\nNew, long term evidence has shed light on the effects of internal and external shocks to this nation, and globally over many decades. And while exogenous growth models can be applied to technological shocks, endogenous growth explains why those shocks inevitably deepen the capital of the labor force. \n\nTechnology allows for more output per worker than ever before; labor increases using the same amount of hours. Not just technology can grow the economy but the TFP (total factors of production) can as well, like the skills and abilities of trained and talented human capital. Labor deepening exists within steemit as people's abilities and skills heighten. This is because we continuously improve, to stay at the top of the free-market demand apex.\n### An investment\nInvesting in human resources, new technology, and sustainable infrastructure (that said transactions occur over), is the new focus of growth measurement in the economy. Focusing on endogenous measurements of growth rather than exogenous is what is necessary in the long-term. And steemit can accommodate that. How will government policy solve the economic problem of capital per worker decrease due to the large amount of population that will turn 60 between 2020 and 2050 (Kim & Hewings, 2013)? How will it address the new market of 3 billion new internet users? How will it deal with a long term economic slow-down as a result? Much less, how will it transcend the predicted financial crash of the U.S. dollar (as [outlined](https://steemit.com/steem/@thelord/steemit-and-the-us-economic-collapse-of-september-27-2016) by @thelord)? The separation between government policy and private sector economic business strategy lies in the training and investment of human capital, aka the education system, aka steemit.\n### No government control and the resulting education\nWithout government control, the private sector would need to establish their own education systems, to prepare children to enter the workforce. How would businesses even begin to do that? What types of people would a business choose? What business would the parents choose to educate their children? And would having non-standardized education increase the GDP, or would it weaken it? Steemit, through its free-market allocation of wealth, would drive children and parents to educate themselves, in the most needed fields. The focus would become bent on finding a need and filling it.\n### Deepening brings salvation\nThese situations can only be measured in endogenous growth. Government economic policy aka steemit can serve to motivate or enhance this growth in human capital, in a way that businesses may fail at - by providing a free-market demand for education across the globe, by maintaining the infrastructure already in use to house this education, and by employing retirees that wish to continue to contribute to the workforce. Breaking down current government policy, however, is still a must. It needs to be rebuilt efficiently, utilizing new technology, to maximize its effect on the GDP. It needs to question what will be done in regards to the slow-down. Surely, if it adapted steemit, it would lose control in planning for and protecting the future health of the economy. But this control would simply be replaced with free-market principles, as opposed to the current capitalist structure. A free-market application to long-term economic strategy is the steemit solution, and the one that could save us all.\n![steemlifelogo83c22.png](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/steemlifelogo83c22.png)\n### References:\n1.

    "body": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VuVQsID.jpg\"/>\nI like talking about hijacked words.   Usually the hijacking occurs due to actions of some alphabet agency of the government, or a large corporate agenda.    Today is slightly different.    The word I am going to focus on today is ***Organic***.      By focusing on this word I am not endorsing GMO vs Organic debate that occurs, though I was on the side lines of a very amusing debate of that type today.   All of my friends bickering back and forth in our Politics, Religion, and BS channel.  :)    The idea of Organic as a label being misused came up.    I realized \"*Hey, there is another great example of a hijacked word*.\"\n\n<h1>What do I mean by hijacking?</h1>\nBefore we tackle today's word I want to first explain what I mean by hijacking.    This is my description of when there is a concerted effort to use a word that can illicit an emotional response in some way that is not actually accurate based upon it's definition.     Past words I have discussed are <a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-the-study-based-battle-for-control-of-our-minds\">[Terrorist, Piracy]</a>, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/politics/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-2-0-just-who-is-a-traitor-what-is-treason\">[Traitor]</a>, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-3-0-anarchy-climate-change-occult-conspiracy-theory\">[Anarchy, Climate Change, Occult, and Conspiracy Theory]</a>.   In those cases I explained some possible motives for the hijacking in the <a href=\"https://steemit.com/philosophy/@dwinblood/word-hijacking-the-study-based-battle-for-control-of-our-minds\">first word hijacking</a> post.    Those motives don't seem to apply completely in the case of the words today.   If they do I may simply have not identified how yet.\n\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/DJHLI7Bfi1Vpm/giphy.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>Organic</h1>\nThe first thing I like to do generally when going over the hijacking of words is to find a definition for the word from before it was hijacked.   This is important for eventually the dictionaries do update and include new definitions for the words.   This is partially due to lingual drift.\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/iS0xCfP.png\"/>\nThat is closest to the original definition I can find.   The Meriam/Webster Dictionaries have already incorporated all the new definitions as tied to the organic vs GMO food movements.   I will show those here for completeness.\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ySHBg1c.png\"/>\n\nI have friends that are not opposed to healthy living, but are rightly opposed to the term organic, and often to the term GMO.    They do have good reasons for being opposed to it.   The things they are used to back up or strengthen often would result in the statement being naive, or hypocritical.   I will explain that fully here in just a moment.\n\n***Organic*** technically is defined as \"*of, relating to, or derived from living matter*\" as an adjective.    That is pretty simple.\n\nShort of a few minerals like salt, and water that defines pretty much EVERYTHING we ingest.    It also defines viruses, parasites, symbiotes, you, and I.\n\nIn fact, if our food is not organic then we cannot subsist on it.   We will die very quickly without ingesting organic materials that our body can break down.   Technically, this means that all FOOD is organic.\n\n*Again in case you missed it.   This blog post is not to side with anyone on the GMO vs Organic food debate.   It is purely to illustrate that these are in fact hijacked words/terms*.\n\nSo how is this word hijacked?   We require organic sustenance.   By implying something is organic and something else is not we immediately setup a state where one should not be eaten.    Yet the truth of the matter is that HOW something is acquired does not change whether it is organic or not.    It either is organic or it is not.    If it is not then other than a few minerals and water we can't survive or ingest such things.    So it has been hijacked to extend meaning and paint a picture in our minds that is in fact false in intention.\n\nIf the argument were Natural Foods vs Manufactured Foods then there might be a little bit more sincerity there and it would be closer to actual meaning.    The term organic when used in these arguments is a very \"loaded\" word.\n\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnK80JHV0fgDZzG/giphy.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>GMO</h1>\nThis acronym stands for Genetically Modified Organism.    The use of it is usually derogatory and is used to indicate something was modified by careful manipulation in a lab.   It happened by chemical manipulation, injection, cell splicing, etc.     Yet in reality we have been doing this throughout human history.   The difference today is we've created methods where we can do this very rapidly rather than the long tedious process of the past.   So when people use the term GMO they technically are using it for the fast lab created method.    Oh and it is important that the word ORGANISM is a noun version of Organic.    So GMOs are organic, it is part of their name.\n\nIn history we have bred animals.\n\nWe have bred plants.\n\nThese are all genetic modification with us giving evolution a push by setting up certain environmental conditions and opportunities.    They still are occurring due to human intervention.\n\nFor plants it is likely we wouldn't have CORN as a crop without such activities.    We also might not have any bananas left without such activities.\n\n<b>Popped Secret: The Mysterious Origin of Corn</b>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBuYUb_mFXA\n\n<b>The surprising history of bananas in under 2 minutes</b>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpAHPXNhAwk\n\n<b>And Man Created Dog</b>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFzbBVMR8zA\n\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/98pZs1ZVaWb1C/giphy.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>Troll</h1>\nI am not actually sure why we settled on the word Troll to describe people that intentionally seek to antagonize others and gain pleasure from it.    In the early days of the internet we called them **Flamers** and the actions they were involved in **flame wars**.    Troll and trolling replaced these terms.\n\nWe also came up with phrases such as \"*Don't feed the troll*.\"\n\nSo this word was repurposed from its original meaning.   It was hijacked.    Yet this does not match what I normally would write about in terms of hijacking.     At least yet.\n\nWhen people are not intentionally antagonizing and are instead arguing and perhaps in the throes of cognitive dissonance they are NOT trolling.     A troll is not someone who disagrees with you and gets passionate about the subject.\n\nSo how it is hijacked is when someone chooses to use the term ***Troll***  to describe someone who disagrees with them.\n\n<img src=\"https://media0.giphy.com/media/3oEduGzkdvam26MrXG/200w.gif\"/>\n*Source: giphy.com*\n<h1>Hijacking</h1>\nNo one has called me out on it yet, so I thought I would call myself out.   I have hijacked the word hijacked for the emotional imagery I hope it places in people's mind.   I want them to be outraged at groups seeking to emotionally manipulate you into making a larger emotional relation to an action than you would normally have.\n\nI am a hypocrite here.   I acknowledge that I am doing this intentionally.   I want people to care about people altering their words for political and economic agendas.    I want people to start thinking people using words to define something that they actually are not.    It is essentially taking a metaphor and instead of treating it like a metaphor we now instead use it as the actual definition.\n\nA definition for this that would not use the word hijacking would be, redefining, repurposing, or changing.    Yet I do not think those have quite the FUN and emotional impact of hijacking.   Hijacking is seen as something hostile and aggressive.    Much like the word Piracy for copying something digital is nothing like what piracy actually meant.\n\nI hope you got something out of this edition of the word hijacking series.   At the very least maybe something to think about or enjoyment.   Thank you for your time.",

I do these together in order to give my body a balance of \"push\" and \"pull\" on my muscles, seeing to it that adding muscle doesn't pull my posture forward or backward.\n* I jog outside, in beautiful nature trails, for anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours, 3 to 6 times per week.\n* I do a heavy-lifting routine with barbells and dumbbells for 1 to 1.5 hours, 2 to 3 days per week.\n* I do a Pilates, core workout, routine for 45 minutes to an hour, 3 to 4 days per week.\n* I eat A LOT of greens, fruits, beans, nuts and seeds.\n* I especially eat lots of hemp seed (hearts), oatmeal, and organic peanut butter (heavy protein) - usually all mixed together.  It tastes heavenly :)\n* I meditate for 20 to 30 minutes in the morning and sometimes for another 15 to 20 minutes before I go to sleep at night.\n\nI do these things routinely and I LOVE doing it.  I feel great!  I feel healthy, vital, strong, flexible, calm and relaxed.  My mind is clear and focused on my goals and the people whom I love.  I'm happy and healthy physically, psychologically, and socially.  Everything is good :)\n \n# My Goal Here On Steemit..\n\n...is to share some of my health-tips and personal techniques that I've used to make it easy and painless to develop healthier habits.  I plan to share some of the tools I use to loosen up my body, making it feel wonderful and bringing all the \"life\" to the muscles that they need in order to get the most out of stretching and exercising them.  I'll go through how I approach exercise and weight-lifting.  I'll share my secrets on how to build a strong and flexible body in a way that's fun and effective.  I'll touch base on my diet approach and even share some delicious and nutritious recipes.\n\n# Keep Your Eyes Peeled\n\nI'll be around @feelinggood.  Throw me an up-vote and a follow if you like where I'm going with this.\n\nI'm so excited to share my secrets to healthy and happy living :)\n\n# Peace.\n\n<center><img src=\"http://quotes.greet2k.com/image-code/health-3.jpg\"></center><br>\n<center><([source image](http://quotes.greet2k.com/image-code/health-3.jpg))></center>",

I warn you, I'm not an artist and my creation do not pretend to be an art. just something came over me.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/9b/OCNpU4gQRx0.jpg\" width=\"602\" height=\"389\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/94/EzJAJcbbqcE.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"414\"/></p>\n<p>So what do you think?</p>\n<p>Now, lets return to my basilicum. I decided to plant purple basil at home because:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;1. I love to see how plants are growing;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. I like the taste and flawour of basil;</p>\n<p>3. basil is not only a delicious condiment, it has so many more useful properties;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. growing basil at home is cheaper than buying it in a supermarket in winter;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. basil just looks beautiful.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/ac/26h6wvaCyKE.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/b3/9PkkuC3hnNE.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"/></p>\n<p>this photos were made by me 2 years ago in my garden.</p>\n<p>I want to note that basil &nbsp;leaves contains a large number of the important minerals and vitamins (A, B, P, C, etc.), various amino acids, essential oils. &nbsp;It`s a wonderful immune system stimulator, improves memory, lowers cholesterol in the blood, if you are suffering from insomnia, then there will help basil, as it has a calming effect on the nervous system.</p>\n<p>And specialy for girls, basil is an excellent antioxidant. Eat basil regularly, and your skin will always stay beautiful and healthy, the same thing will be with your hair.</p>\n<p>If you want to stay beautiful and healthy as long as possible, then eat as much basil as possible, it will slow down the aging process and prolong youth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Now, a simple plan, how to plant basil:</p>\n<p>you'll need: soil, flower pot, spoon (or something like that), water, seeds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/ba/uFpyFu5zp0I.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"259\"/>&nbsp; <img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/c1/PzwWU0v31HI.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"259\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/c8/7fKXPqtl0Mc.jpg\" width=\"325\" height=\"259\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/32/mhEkv77lnO8.jpg\" width=\"272\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>put soil in to the flower pot</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/47/xLfbxm1Uo5w.jpg\" width=\"366\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;tamp the soil with spoon&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/4e/KUGmIripXzs.jpg\" width=\"461\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;pour the ground and make holes of 1.5-2 cm deep in it&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/55/GBsJg9nsoTY.jpg\" width=\"461\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>I did it with the spoon</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/5c/VOOIptBr2aQ.jpg\" width=\"461\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>put the seeds in to the soil</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/63/MgcHM4ifZ8I.jpg\" width=\"413\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/71/LCC4d_P_PuM.jpg\" width=\"385\" height=\"372\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;close the holes with the soil</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/78/dsBEWxUSKGM.jpg\" width=\"414\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>put the flowerpot on the sunny window</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c836531/v836531195/86/G8xTEIi0Y3I.jpg\" width=\"461\" height=\"259\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Now let's see what will happen with my magical flower pot.

    "body": "<html>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good afternoon Steemit, I am officially done breast feeding and am ready to get rid of the last few pounds that are still hanging on from my pregnancy so I have been trying out different ways to cut calories from my diet without loosing flavor. Spaghetti squash is a great substitute for pasta or in this case rice. Spaghetti squash has about 40 calories per cup while rice has upwards of 200. It also has fiber, potassium and vitamins A and C. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For chicken:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1lb chicken breast</li>\n  <li>1 tsp ancho chili</li>\n  <li>1 tbs olive oil</li>\n  <li>1 lime (juice and zest)</li>\n  <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For squash:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1 spaghetti squash (cut in half length wise and seeds removed)</li>\n  <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>\n  <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preheat oven to 425F. &nbsp;In a baking dish, sprinkle chicken with ancho chili. &nbsp;Mix together oil, lime zest and juice and garlic. &nbsp;Pour mixture over chicken. &nbsp;Drizzle olive oil over squash and season with salt and pepper. &nbsp;Place cut side down on baking sheet. &nbsp;Bake a together for 30 min. &nbsp;Shred squash with a fork and put in the bottom of bowls. &nbsp;Shred chicken with forks and put on top of squash. &nbsp;I added cheese, salsa and guacamole to ours but you can top with anything you like. &nbsp;Enjoy!</p>\n<p>https://puu.sh/rcmnK/c059def2e0.png</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "What is Gridcoin?\n\n>Gridcoin (Ticker: GRC) is a decentralized, open source math-based digital asset (cryptocurrency). It performs transactions peer-to-peer cryptographically without the need for a central issuing authority. \nhttp://www.gridcoin.us/\n>BOINC is an open-source volunteer oriented computing grid that combines the processing power of all individual users for the purposes of scientific research. It's free, and harnesses the unused clock cycles from processors and graphics cards to attempt to cure cancer/aids/ebola/malaria, map the milkyway, crack enigma codes, etc.. \n\n\nWhen I first started mining GRC, community members provided me with enough GRC to start staking  (I'm not going to explain it here, but part of GRC mining involves Proof of Stake).    I have researched the coin to my own understanding (not expert), including some past hiccups, and I work primarily on GRC now.  I think there is potential in mining the coin, and that even if the investment fails to meet the potential, the mining itself has accomplished something for science.\n\nTo help that potential bloom, I am hoping to encourage some newcomers to Gridcoin mining by offering a staking balance of 100 GRC to the first 5 posters that create a wallet (or have started in the last couple of days) and post a receiving address on this blog.\n\nI found the community to be very helpful in answering newcomers' questions.\nhttps://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net:6667/#gridcoin\nhttps://cryptocointalk.com/forum/232-cryptocoin-forums/\n\nI am not the best one to ask for tech help, though.  Just sayin!\n\nGood mining!\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.imgur.com/hPY1Osp.png",

    "body": "http://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/0/3/IMAG03431j_6525197_23304303.jpg\nFans of extreme adventures will surely like my next article, which will be devoted to excursions to the salt mines of Soledar!\nWe began our tour of the salt mine with the instruction, basically it all comes down to the fact that not to touch anything in the wrong place not to go and to follow all the instructions of our guide. I think everyone knows that without a helmet in a mine is impossible, and therefore it is here also attached.\n\nAfter that our tour group in a special \"Elevator\" which in the language of miners, called the cage, was lowered into the mine. Just imagine the crate for fifteen minutes down to a depth of 300 m. So that impressions from the descent will definitely last a lifetime.\n\nI must say that the temperature in the mine is kept at 14\u00b0C to 16\u00b0C. Therefore, if you decide to visit in the summer \u2013 dress warmly in cold season temperature very comfortable.\n\nSalt mines of Soledar has formed in the Ancient oceans. So only here you have a unique opportunity to walk on its bottom.\n\nMine are all made of salt, walls, and floors. And in order to check, you can always try the taste. \nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/2/2/IMAG0362jp_9184718_23304322.jpg\nDue to the ions of salt, which it contains, even in the air in a salt mine the cleanest conditions, even much sterile as an surgical room. The usual guided tour, which lasts one and a half hours, replaces the 15 inhalation procedures and guarantees that at least two and a half months you will not get sick.\n\nSo, after the descent, we took salt corridors, featuring a variety of unique exhibits. Will not describe in detail all tell me about the most interesting of them.\n\nSo, for example, very much of the famous Donetsk palm made of salt.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/2/9/IMAG0354jp_9421794_23304329.jpg\nImagine here at a depth of 300 m is even a chapel. The thing is that in the past the miners spent so many time in the mine, that they had done a Holy place. Here you can free to light a candle for the health.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/4/8/IMAG0365jp_3366678_23304348.jpg\nAnd mine is an exhibition of paintings by local artists which are available for purchase.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/6/6/IMAG0375jp_4203456_23304366.jpg\nDid you know that salt is not only white, but red. Red salt is generally a very rare mineral, it occurs once in 30 years. In a salt mine is an artificial stone red salt, they say it grants wishes. So, do not miss your chance .\n\nAt the end of the tour, our waited main exhibit salt mine is a huge hall. Just imagine its height is 28 metres is a 9-storey building and a width of 17 meters.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/3/8/2/IMAG0406jp_5860409_23304382.jpg\nOften hosts various concerts, shows and so on.\nAnd on New year every year is a huge tree, which is accompanied by a Christmas matinees for children and Christmas show for adults. The holidays last from December 15 to January 15.\n\nIn the salt room is a football field where everyone can play football. And for those who don't care about soccer, here is a small movie theater where we watched a film about the history of the salt mine. Also in the local mini-caf\u00e9 you can buy coffee, tea and sweets. It will be a good addition to the movie.\nhttp://i6.pixs.ru/storage/4/1/5/IMAG0408jp_4233814_23304415.jpg\nAfter that we went back to the crate and went upstairs. Be sure to find a small crystal of salt, it will be a wonderful reminder of such a special tour!\n\nIf the souvenir could not be found, you will be able to buy it. This mine is located near the place of sale. From best-selling variety , suggest, purchase salt lamp. Just keep in mind that for best results, the lamp must be made from a solid piece of salt.\n\n\nTour to salt mines of Soledar is an unforgettable, extreme, and most importantly very good for your health!",

Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six...\"<br>\n&nbsp;- Revelation Chapter 13 (</strong></em><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13&amp;version=KJV\"><em><strong>Full Chapter</strong></em></a><em><strong>)</strong></em></blockquote>\n<h3>Yes Virginia... I hate to break it to you, but digital currency IS indeed \"<em>one more step towards the mark of the beast</em>\" - <em>and we all know it.&nbsp;</em></h3>\n<p>Let's just get that out of the way now. But fear not, this is NOT a<em> paranoid religious</em> post warning people about the eternal dangers of joining Steemit, nor of using digital currency in general however. This is just a hopefully<em> rational religious</em> post (inspired by <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/4-reasons-why-your-nation-will-kill-cash-for-a-digital-currency\">a secular article</a>) meant to<em> stem paranoid fear</em> (amongst Christians mainly) of utilizing Steemit specifically, and digital currency in general.&nbsp;Which I will get back to in just a second...</p>\n<p>But first... If to you, \"stemming this fear\" makes me \"part of the Satanic conspiracy\" then I can't help that, and I won't engage with or reply to you if that is your view (which you are entitled to hold, and even to express as a comment below).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'd rather use my time to inform non-Christian people who may have clicked in here (for laughs perhaps?)&nbsp;that Yes, I believe that the mark of the beast is coming, and you DO need to aware of the dangers of accepting it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x395/14358900_10154412654816605_8330352735442203600_n.jpg?oh=e2a53091d31ad716798686aec3f7bef0&amp;oe=586CF056\" width=\"305\" height=\"395\"/><br>\nImage Source &amp; External Article: http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/markbeast.htm</p>\n<p>&nbsp;(Hence the external articles links being detailed here for further reading - which I have not closely vetted btw, they just had top matches for images)...</p>\n<h3>Anyways...</h3>\n<h3>As I told my friend Don (who DID join Steemit @roswellrockman ) \"So is your debit card!\"</h3>\n<p><strong>Putting Don and I's end-of-conversation succinctly, there are many aspects of our everyday lives that have brought and are bringing us \"one step closer\" to the mark of the beast - but they are not in themselves the mark, they are not evil, and (imho) they are not to be feared, or shunned.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>(Altho I will note respectfully that The American Amish community feels differently - see the link below these next images.)</p>\n<h3>There are indeed many examples from our now-everyday lives that could easily be said to be bringing us \"one step closer\" ... such as the \"Bar Codes\" on every product we purchase</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/wmb2.jpg\"/><br>\n... especially if the same types of \"scanners\" that read them, were then pointed to a laser tattoo or RFID chip in your hand, to receive payment for these goods at the register.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/wmb3.jpg\"/><img src=\"http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/wmb4.jpg\"/><br>\nAll 3 Images above &amp; External Article: http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index1392.htm</p>\n<p>\"Radio Frequency ID chips\" (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification\">Wikipedia article</a>) are already being used (some will say \"being tested\") to help pet owners keep track of their pets. Wal-Mart and other retailers also use them to track expensive items, to help prevent shoplifting. And especially \"hi-tech\" firms demanding secrecy and security clearances even use them on employees!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Could Big Brother and The Rothchild's and The Federal Reserve Banks and The U.N. (collectively, \"The New World Order\") one day very soon use all of this to both track you physically, and to observe or control your money supply?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Absolutely!</p>\n<p>It's no stretch at all to imagine combining RFID technology with UPC Bar Codes - and then connecting it all to your bank account via the Internet (or the Blockchain!) - to fulfill the Bible prophecy about the mark of the beast happening in the near future, or in our lifetimes.</p>\n<p>Folks I am no stranger to this belief. I first penned the words myself way back in 1997 (in my original webpage and book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Ueug63\"><strong>\"Come Sail Away : UFO Phenomenon &amp; The Bible\"</strong></a>- &lt;&lt; Amazon link to 2105 version) in the section I titled \"Genesis 6 to 666\"</p>\n<p><strong>\"To understand how the world\u2019s entire economy could be tied into a mark on one\u2019s flesh would be a completely unimaginable miracle - a near impossibility - inconceivable to most Christians throughout the ages. This has left some events of the book of Revelation a little hard to piece together into a believable probability, much less an immediate future.</strong><br>\n<br>\n\"<strong>In order to accomplish such an incredible thing, you\u2019d have to have some way to access a person\u2019s bank account from anywhere in the known world; all financial institutions would have to have some way of talking to each other through some sort of, of, machinated \"net,\" or a \"web,\" or something; you\u2019d have to come up with some sort of mark, or magnetic strip, or some \"barred code\" that some futuristic \"scanner\" could read; surgical or laser-tattoo technology capable of implanting it, and a \"personal secret code\" so that no one could ever rob you in this \"cashless society.\" Any-time machinery, for financial transactions, would have to be everywhere. Everyone would have to be assigned a separate number at birth. These \"scanner devices\" would have to be in every grocery, hardware, department and convenience store, and every product would have to be marked with this computerized bar-code\u2026</strong><br>\n<br>\n\"<strong>Yup, you\u2019d need all that\u2026</strong><br>\n<br>\n\"<strong>Get that in place and you\u2019re ready to go...\"&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.alienstranger.com/seekye1//CSAcover.jpg\"/><br>\n(Original 1997 cover, now out of print - <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Ueug63\">2015 version available on Amazon here</a>)</p>\n<h3>So getting to my main point - finally...</h3>\n<p>YES. All kinds of technological advances from the past 30 years and more could and probably WILL - imho - be used to make the Mark of the Beast possible... call me a paranoid religious nut if you like, I do firmly believe that such is coming.</p>\n<p>The Internet itself, for example, connects and brings the whole world online. But if you're using it to read this, now, you are perhaps already hooked, and have no room to talk about Steem or digital currencies being the pre-cursors to the mark of the beast. Because everything you're already using is also...</p>\n<p>The magnetic strips on the back of the debit and credit cards you've (most likely) been using for years and years. Online banking... Bar Code technology in grocery stores that you apparently don't have the religious conviction to oppose not abstain from ... retinal scanners, or fingerprint security features in your smartphone...</p>\n<p>See what I mean?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are not a practicing Amish person - or you use only \"true money\" (Gold and Silver) to barter and to trade for goods and services when you need them (or farm and grow your own food, to ensure that you don't) - then there are already DOZENS of aspects of your everyday life that you have accepted and routinely utilize that have already in fact brought YOU \"one step closer to the mark of the beast.\"</p>\n<p>YES - these \"new-fangled concepts\" like Steem Dollars, Bitcoin, and Digital Currencies are perhaps OBVIOUS steps moving us all FURTHER along that path to one-world government under antichrist...</p>\n<p>(<em><strong>EXCEPT IT MUST BE NOTED</strong></em> in this article for you newbies to the concept, that TO-DATE, popular digital currencies (Steem, Bitcoin, Etherium, etc, etc) are actually intended AND ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED to help users MOVE AWAY from immoral government spying networks, and away from evil centralized banking platforms, putting \"the power in the hands of the people\" - for awhile at least.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So technically, by joining Steemit and adopting Steem as currency, you are fighting the underpinings of the Satanic One-World government that is forming all around us. You are actually, literally, restraining The Beast from his march to power! For awhile anyways...</p>\n<p>So there.) &nbsp;</p>\n<p>But yes, I would affirm that some form of digital currency in general could and possibly will be used by the evil-antichrist-oneworldgovernment-rothschilds-federalreserve-warmongeringtotalitarian New World Order yet to arise under the real antichrist when he appears.</p>\n<p>In fact, it was seeing this article today published by The Coin Telegraph&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/images/725_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8zYjkxMjBiMjg3YTRmZDJjZjE5MTcyZDk0ZDBhOGQzOC5qcGc=.jpg\" width=\"725\" height=\"483\"/><br>\n<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/4-reasons-why-your-nation-will-kill-cash-for-a-digital-currency\"><strong>4 Reasons Why Your Nation Will Kill Cash For A Digital Currency</strong></a></p>\n<p>that inspired me to drop everything and write this particular article.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Coin Telegraph wonderfully details how national interests (Satanic, New World Order interests, for our purposes here) <em>probably will in fact adopt a digital currency of their own</em> in the coming years. I can totally see THEIR VERSION of a global digital currency exchange being the near-final step in implementing the true Mark of the Beast, when (but not until) The Antichrist is revealed.</p>\n<p>But Steem/Steemit just isn't it. Today's free market digital currencies - if anything - are the \"gum in the works - fly in the ointment - monkey wrench in the machine\" to the eventual true Mark of the Beast, now that I think about it. Today's digital currencies actually serve to free us from the system that is now in place, by providing de-centralized mediums of currency (barter, exchange, etc) that serve as powerful alternatives to current banking structures, and chains.</p>\n<p>Governmental agencies (NWO ones or not) are actually in a scramble currently to figure out HOW to regulate, tax, and ultimately control the existing currencies. But neither they - not the devil - are behind them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So my position is to say that unless you're either willing to become Amish today and forego ALL of the technologies I've detailed here (and electricity) then you've really nothing to fear from becoming an early adopter of Steem/Steemit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Bible clearly instructs and solemnly warns all to not accept the Mark of the Beast, <em><strong>when it finally comes</strong></em> in the form of <em><strong>a mark on your hand or forehead that cannot buy or sell without</strong></em> receiving. Abstaining from \"the steps\" has proven impractical, unavoidable (again, except to the Amish), and ultimately not directly commanded in scripture.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n===============<br>\nTwo things in closing:<br>\n#1) Here's one more lengthy scripture-packed article on <a href=\"http://www.av1611.org/666/biochip.html\"><strong>Biochips &amp; TMOTB</strong></a> I'll recommend if you're unlearned about the whole topic...<br>\n#2) You may have noticed in this article that I'm an author in Roswell who deals with the topics of Aliens, UFOs, and The Bible. I have to date organized 7 conferences on that topic, and (after a 7 year hiatus) am putting together a new one for Summer 2017... please follow @ancientofdays for updates and tons of videos yet to come from past speakers and theologians who have participated, and will be again this year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I bring all of this up in THIS article, only to announce here that:</p>\n<p>My non-profit \"<a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemitabuse/@ancientofdays/credibility-matters-on-steemit-therefore-i-wish-to-offer-some-proof-photos-of-my-non-profit-status-and-intent-here\"><strong>Roswell Mission</strong></a>\" will be accepting Steem for conference registrations (follow for details) and that<br>\n<em><strong>UP-FRONT VIP SEATING goes to those who pay VIA STEEMIT!</strong></em></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<center>![](http://svmassagetherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slumpshoulder.jpg)</center>\nHello Steemit, this might be something that can change your life.  Muscle pain is inevitable, it can be an old injury, or just something that suddenly start irritating you and it will not stop. Having over worked muscles or your posture compromised causes a lot of kinks and knots in our body.  Having deep tissue massage is great for alleviating pain. \n\n\n<h4>The benefits of have a deep tissue massage: </h4>\n* Increases blow flow in the body which causes healing to improve\n* Reduces inflammation\n* Loosen tight muscles cluster\n* Improve overall blood pressure \n* Breaks up scar tissue\n* Stress reliever. \n\n90 percent of the people who read this knows that massages are great. I'm an anomaly, I am not a fan of massages but I do believe in the benefits.  I do help out the family when I was younger when they asked for massages and I have a natural talent for it. They were confused and would ask how did I know what to do to fix their back. it still remains a mystery til this day. There are many reason why people can't get massages because of the inconvenience, money, or unavailability which brings me to...\n\n<center> <h3>Lacrosse ball</h3>\n![](http://d2ydh70d4b5xgv.cloudfront.net/images/7/7/mobilitas-mobility-peanut-the-original-double-lacrosse-ball-and-myofascial-1a1f82b10a664b959539aacdbdcf0a96.jpg)\n[Peanut Lacrosse ball](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0140NJXY6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0140NJXY6&linkCode=as2&tag=lasted-20&linkId=1edab9bdbe3612327d257f4edd57cfb5)\n</center>\nThis improve many of my family's lives when they started using it. My mother, dad, brother, and uncles all are a huge fan of these. The idea of lacrosse ball is to place it either on a wall and lean into or placed on the ground and lay on top of it to target stubborn pains and aches caused by tight muscles. It is used by many athletes but also adored by people that hate the idea of working out. The purpose (for example) is to place it somewhere on your back where it is the most uncomfortable and leave it there for around 20 - 30 seconds so that your muscle in that area would slowly release itself.  What I personally do is to put 2 of these under my desk roll my feet with them. \n<center> <h3>Foam roller</h3>\n![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VxfEt9NtL._SL1500_.jpg)\n[Foam Roller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KAEJ3V8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00KAEJ3V8&linkCode=as2&tag=lasted-20&linkId=08ef65112539bb10114ba72a89ab1edd)</center>\nThey are great for the overall body. Less intense as the lacrosse ball but they can improve your posture as you roll on top. Here you also do the same thing as the lacrosse ball you lay on top of it and find a tender spot and hold it there for around 20 - 30 seconds if you can and move to the next spot. I don't advise rolling the lower back since your spine is already curve in and your creating more of a sway back. This improve circulation on your thighs, side torso, chest, or any part of your body that can rest on top of this.\n\n<center> <h3>Theracane</h3>\n![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31VpBRHxbUL.jpg)\n[Theracane](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PRMCJU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000PRMCJU&linkCode=as2&tag=lasted-20&linkId=e0fcdc173eac78ceda3dccef5b82dcaf)\n</center>\n\nThis is the first thing I purchased when I had tense shoulders because I had a laptop bag which was a sling style bag. The uneven weight distribution caused intense pain and knots in my shoulder which I had no way of stretching it out. During that time I was a student living in the dorms. No car, not a lot of money,  and it was super inconvenient to travel one hour to see a physical therapist for a massage. This was introduced to me by my brother who has knots majority of his life because he had bad posture. I gave it a go and it worked! This is great for people who are in a chair and can't just lay down on the floor suddenly like in an office setting. This can be used when reading something on your computer or anything that doesn't requires hands you can start using this to help reduce the pain on your shoulder and neck. \n\nThese three products I always use if I feel that my muscles are tight or overworked that particular day. They are always in hands reach and has improved my over knot issues. Have a great day Steemit, hope this helps!",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0104.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>My entire life, I knew however things shook out, I\u2019d eventually be making comic books as a career. At 36, I\u2019m later to the party than I originally anticipated, but I\u2019ve had three decades to prepare for this! I remember as a kid, just being enamored with comic book art [\u2026and still am]. For years, I\u2019d draw these snake characters during class with my friend Neal. Just page after endless page of snakes killing each other. The kind of gratuitous fantasy violence that defines weirdos in high school.</p>\n<p>Eventually, photography took over my life, but I still read comics, thought about comics and drew comics when I managed to make time. A couple years ago I began stringing together a story for a comic called THEIA. A sci-fi conspiracy story rooted in the real world, based on actual science. I learned how to format full script for comics and graphic novels [\u2026you can read the finished <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">THEIA</a> script in my previous blog, <a href=\"https://steemit.com/writing/@kommienezuspadt/full-script-of-theia-sci-fi-comic-book-theia-exclusively-on-steemit\">\u201cFull script of THEIA sci-fi comic book! Exclusively on Steemit!\u201d</a>]. This was a big divergence than my hack and slash snake comics with Neal [\u2026who\u2019s stories progressed with each turn of the page, like a Miyazaki film, but really horrible].</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0105.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1132\"/></p>\n<p>It was during the process of writing the first draft for <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">THEIA</a> that I realized all these years I\u2019ve been so drawn to comics, the real allure for me was story telling and character creation, even more than great art. I\u2019ve been creating comics my entire life, and thus, creating characters along the way. Once I began disciplining myself with taking writing more seriously, I discovered other helpful tools to aide in the creation process. I began taking &nbsp;inventories, outlining in depth documentation of each characters lives, affiliations and personalities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Character profiles are something I\u2019ve done for 20 years. I mimicked my favorite fantasy artists like Gerald Brom, Boris Vallejo and the one and only, Frank Frazetta. I\u2019d seen pencil sketches of their concept designs with monsters, heroes and heroines, and just did my best to emulate them. I used to draw the typical front, side, three-quarter and head sketches as a reference bible [\u2026granted, much easier when it was just snakes].</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0106.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"519\"/></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been enjoying a renaissance of creativity since committing to doing comics full time, and character creation is where I spend most of my time. THEIA is still my priority as I have an active <a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\">Patreon</a> campaign and those pledging support are doing so for that particular title. I do, however, have two other stories I\u2019m developing which are currently knee deep in the character creation process. A Bukowski-esk pulp crime genre during the late 80\u2019s following a private investigator throughout his struggle with sobriety in Queens, NY.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SketchUpdate004.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1130\"/></p>\n<p>The other is a dark ghost story taking place in the mid-1800\u2019s, surrounding a recently deceased, troubled soul that finds himself caught between the realm of the living, and the afterlife; unable to pass for fear of judgement after a life of heinous acts. The characters in this story were inspired by my most interesting friends, and obscure tales of macabre lore during the industrial revolution and the Southwestern US history.</p>\n<p>I wish I was further along in my pursuit of story telling, world building and character creation. I wish I had decades of experience to share here on Steemit. I don\u2019t want to come across like I\u2019m the authority on these complex, disciplined skills; I\u2019ve only been seriously absorbing the art for a couple of years. I imagine, however, there are quite a few new writers, artists and creators here, navigating their own discoveries and process. With that in mind, [and in the spirit of all the things that makes Steemit great for me personally] here a few techniques I use to further my writing and a few resources I\u2019ve found helpful in house, right here on Steemit.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Real-life Inspiration:</strong> As mentioned, take inspiration from people in life. Friends, or even family. Accentuate the personalities. Exaggerate the quirks or circumstances. For me personally, it\u2019s a big help to to have someone in mind when drawing, and developing a character.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Character Inventories:</strong> Write up an involved character inventory [\u2026sometimes called a character bible]. A reference of everything you can imagine that defines that character. Their ethnicity, background, where they were born, how old they are, where they went to college, their diet, etc. It\u2019s tedious if you\u2019re working on a character heavy story with a big \u201ccast\u201d, but it pays dividends. Once you have those inventories, you can stick characters in situations and the story literally writes itself. If you have a character that\u2019s a passionate vegan, you can immediately come up with dozens of possibilities if they were accidentally locked in a butcher\u2019s freezer. Same with politics, religious, social issues. It really unloads much of the burden of dreaming up a brilliant scene.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/steemit0107.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1765\"/></p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Name Generators:</strong> Name generators are something I rely on quite a bit. There are many available online. They\u2019re usually free, and they\u2019re a great place to launch in to naming a character. Often times, once you have a name, more of the personality and background unfolds organically. <a href=\"www.seventhsanctum.com\">www.seventhsanctum.com</a> has an excellent list of name generators tailored specifically for several genres and character types.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Research:</strong> This is one of those things that seems obvious, but I challenge you to go deeper. For my ghost story, I started researching life in the mid-1800\u2019s in the Southwest and Dust Bowl of the United States. As I dug through historical sites, I found some of the events of that time. A few hours in, I read about droughts and plagues, which would have been rich content for a story, but going even deeper, I read about these crazy grasshopper plagues! Even deeper, I found accounts of specific families and individuals that described enormous clouds of locusts that swept through their homes and ate everything, including the clothes off their bodies! I encourage you to obsessively push through references, way past where most people would get their first idea and start writing. Beyond that is where you\u2019re going to unearth something truly unique and memorable. I\u2019ve already written a treatment for this epic locust plague in my ghost story [\u2026sort of nervous about what that\u2019s going to be like to draw, though].</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Don\u2019t Lose The Magic:</strong> For me, the magic happens in the moments before I fall asleep. Without fail, that\u2019s where I get my best, originally ideas. Sometimes it\u2019s just a small line a dialog. Other times it\u2019s as vague as a plot point. It\u2019s a tough discipline to wake yourself up and write it down, but that [\u2026for me] is where the magic happens. It\u2019s invaluable, and worth the trouble of having to fall back asleep. I jot things down in the Notes app of my phone. I have some friends that just wake up and make audio recordings. You might get your best ideas during different times. Sometimes I have brilliant moments on long drives. Either way, document it! You\u2019ll be glad you did.</p>\n<p>Honestly, Steemit has been a revolution for me as well. Since the platform is incentivized, there is a tremendous wealth of references on writing, drawing, how-to\u2019s. Beyond that, I spent much of my time reading and curating novels and short stories posted by the authors bringing their work to the site. Just this morning, I found a comprehensive article by @jamielefay titled <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@jamielefay/steemit-and-the-future-of-book-publishing\">\u201cSteemit and the future of book publishing\u201d</a>. Everything here, totally relevant if you\u2019re creating comics or graphic novels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.madeineighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SketchUpdate011.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1130\"/></p>\n<p>Keep writing, creating and sharing! More work from my comic,<a href=\"www.theiacomic.com\"> THIEA</a>, and other stories to come. I\u2019d love feedback and constructive criticism.</p>\n<p>I post daily. Follow me <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kommienezuspadt\">@kommienezuspadt</a> so you don\u2019t miss a post.</p>\n</html>",

I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.\n\n### Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.\n\n### Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques. In Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.\n\n### Having completed the Advanced cooking level there I traveled to Italy and learnt more about Mediterranean cooking and then returned to Brasil, where I\u2019m now based.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://gustavopasquini.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logo_transparent.png?w=465\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Site ](https://gustavopasquini.com)\n\n> ### [ Chef Recipes Shop ](https://gustavopasquini-shop.com)\n\n> ### [Blog Post ](https://gustavopasquini.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/pastel-of-banana-with-chocolate/)\n\n> ### [Recipe Site ](http://www.tudogostoso.com.br/receita/1660-pastel-de-banana.html)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "body": "I'm sick of all the weird rules I make for myself. Why do I have to work in order to feel accepted by myself? While at the same time I also have the rule: I have to accept all of me. And I think I do. Yes I do. I accept myself the way I am. No I don't. Ha ha shit. There are moments when I can say 'I accept all of me' and it feels real. But there are definitely also moments like now: it's 11:30 AM, I had a long sleep, lay in bed for half an hour without getting up, okay so far, didn't blame myself too much for that. But even that sentence already reveals that I do consider to blame myself for it. Why not just ask myself then: Do I want to blame myself for lying in bed when I have the feeling that I should get up and start my working day? Noooooo. Of course not! I don't want to blame myself for anything ever! However nice this sounds I don't have the feeling I can control my feelings of blame. It seems to happen before I'm aware of it. Okay, so I'm just practicing awareness. I have a clear intention, which is to never ever blame myself for anything. Very easy, no exceptions to this simple rule. And I'm practicing with becoming aware of the moment when I apparently decided to blame myself for something. I don't think it was such a conscious decision, I mean... I'm a little bit wary here. I feel some peacefulness as well though. This morning when I came out of the bedroom, I felt both my feet on the wooden floor, the morning felt fresh and I had this feeling of happy anticipation of being able to do exactly what I wanted to do. I thought: How do I want to live this day? I smiled. And then... things went differently, I had my breakfast in bed with Jordan. My vagina was hurting today, yet we had such a beautiful connection conversation about our relationship, that I did wanted to have sex. Then we had sex and.... bam, suddenly it was 11:30 AM and I noticed feeling bad and guilty and disappointed in myself for not having done any work yet. I feel so stuck at this problem. Didn't I realize years ago already that I didn't want my self worth to be depended upon my productivity anymore? And still it's hard. Or is it hard because I say it's hard? Am I feeling stuck, but am I not really stuck? Is this stream of consciousness long enough already? Apparently I think there's a rule for that too. As I said: I'm fucking sick of all the rules I make for myself. They DO NOT exist in reality. It's just my mind, it's feelings, the feelings are real, but they are NOT based on real facts. There are no fucking rules. I do not have to think about rules, I don't need to consider rules when I do or don't do something, it alllll fineee. That's me aggresively forcing down a new rule on myself. The new rule is: thou shall never listen to any rules anymore! What's the opposite of a rule? Freedom, is what comes up in me. Housemate just came in, asking how I'm doing, me: 'Good. You?' It's always hard to accurately describe my state of being in just a sentence or two. So freedom. That sounds nice. I am free. No I'm not, I have to go to the swimming hole with Nele. This afternoon. And afternoon comes quick when you cuddle, talk and have sex the whole morning. Do I want to go to the swimming hole? Not today maybe, actually. Oh god, I just feel like I now will have to work the whole day to make up for my morning. And this freacking happens almost every morning it seems! I'm free. This is how decided to live my mornings. I made the decision in total freedom, and I can make whatever different or similar decision today. I feel like eating a Chinese noodle dish. Hmmm. Alright let's check if Nele has send me something back, and see if I can do some work. And make tea. That's one of those things. I feel like I'm wasting time when I'm making tea while I shouldn't work, but shit, I have to put liquid in my body as well right?? Maybe not after my breatharian retreat in March, but for now my body needs water. I hardly drank anything yet today. Do I need to justify whatever 'waste of time' though? I am free. I wish I would feel that.",

Female bodies, in particular, undergo changes throughout the entire span of a woman\u2019s life. From puberty, to pregnancy, to menopause, female hormones can change on a dime, altering the physical and emotional state of a woman instantly.But sometimes, these changes can result in more extreme &nbsp;than you would experience with typical bodily phases. PCOS is one of those conditions.Polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, is an endocrine condition caused by elevated levels of&nbsp;androgens, or male hormones, in a woman\u2019s body. The most common symptom&nbsp;of PCOS, one that women everywhere struggle with, is thick .Women with PCOS will experience various degrees of facial hair, or occasionally&nbsp;the condition&nbsp;will reveal itself as adult acne. No matter the physical result, experiencing these changes without knowing much about the condition can be a scary thing. Embarrassing, even, as there are so many social stigmas revolving around what women should and should not look like.If you suspect you may have PCOS, we encourage you to contact your primary care doctor immediately for an evaluation. In the meantime, read on to learn about the symptoms and treatment methods for this common condition.</p>\n<h2>What Is&nbsp;PCOS?</h2>\n<p>Researchers have discovered that the elevated levels of androgens that ultimately cause PCOS are&nbsp;caused by both genetic and environmental factors. The condition has a wide range of symptoms and levels of severity, oftentimes making it difficult to diagnose.Current&nbsp;research suggests it may be linked to insulin, as studies have found PCOS linked to women with higher insulin levels. PCOS is&nbsp;also a risk factor for diabetes, , high blood pressure, sleep apnea, and some .While PCOS can be a difficult condition to handle in day-to-day life, women who live with the condition are certainly not in a minority. About 20&nbsp;percent&nbsp;of women worldwide between the ages of 18 and 44 struggle with the symptoms of PCOS, making this one of the most common hormonal conditions in the world. In the U.S. alone, over 200,000 new cases of PCOS are brought to light each year.</p>\n<h2>What Are The Symptoms?</h2>\n<p>Body hair may be the most well-known symptom of PCOS, but there are so many layers to this condition. If you\u2019ve been noticing excessive weight gain, mood swings, or sudden acne, you may be observing signs of PCOS without even realizing it.</p>\n<h3>1. Abundant Body Hair</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/tiphero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/facial.jpg?w=750\" width=\"750\" height=\"427\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The most common symptom of the condition is . This body hair will vary woman to woman; some ladies will get hair that\u2019s thicker or more fine than others.Location of the hair varies as well. While facial hair is common with PCOS, chest, stomach, and arm hair are also just as likely to grow, depending on the individual and how severe the PCOS is.</p>\n<h3>2. Irregular Periods</h3>\n<p>If your menstruation cycle seems&nbsp;off \u2013 if&nbsp;you\u2019re spotting all month long or you\u2019ll spot two days every&nbsp;week and that\u2019s it \u2013 don\u2019t just blame it on your birth control. PCOS is a hormonal disorder, so a woman\u2019s most prevalent hormonal cycle (menstruation) WILL&nbsp;be thrown off if PCOS is present in the body.Again, this varies woman to woman. Some women will see their periods stop all together, while others will get heavier and more extreme. Some women will even experience a painful cramping in their pelvis rather than a irregular period cycle.</p>\n<h3>3. Weight Gain</h3>\n<p>PCOS does affect your metabolism, so sudden weight gain is another giveaway of the condition. This gain is usually seen in the midsection and is linked to insulin levels; as mentioned, people with PCOS have higher insulin levels and are more likely to have Type II diabetes, which will also encourage weight gain.It is possible to lose weight with PCOS, as long as you understand what herbs, foods, and exercises will help you best! <img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/tiphero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GirlWithAcneforList.jpg?w=750\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;If you thought your &nbsp;were back in 10th grade, but you\u2019re finding yourself suddenly breaking out, this could be because of PCOS.This happens because hormone levels in the body have spiked and oil production has been increased on the skin, causing .&nbsp;This is essentially what happens right before you get your period (more hormones = more oil = more acne), but far more severe in nature.This increased oil production also tends to affect the scalp in people with PCOS, causing intense.</p>\n<h3>5. Anxiety or Depression</h3>\n<p>Because PCOS is a hormonal condition, your mood and mental well-being are affected, too. Like any woman with PMS can tell you, swinging hormones will do a number on your mood and your self-esteem. So with severe hormone imbalances, like with PCOS,&nbsp;women are more likely to be suffering from anxiety, stress, irritation, and depression.What\u2019s more, because the symptoms of PCOS have such a negative connotation with femininity, women with this condition are often wrestling with their perception of themselves and feeling serious emotional strain or pressure.</p>\n<h3>6. Incontinence</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/tiphero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ovary-Diagram.gif?resize=640%2C394\" width=\"640\" height=\"394\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;PCOS prevents the body from ovulating regularly, or sometimes from ovulating at all. For this reason, PCOS is one of the most common fertility issues in the world, preventing many women with the condition from having children.The follicles that normally release an egg from the ovary never mature due to lack of hormone, and so the eggs remain in the ovary, unable to be fertilized.&nbsp;Pregnancy is possible with PCOS, but extra fertility treatments may be required.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How Is PCOS Treated?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no cure for PCOS. However, there are treatments to help women subdue symptoms or cope with the condition. If you\u2019re experiencing any of the symptoms listed above, you may want to explore the follow options for treatment of PCOS.</p>\n<h3>1. Try Magnesium</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/tiphero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dollarphotoclub_59846549-e1428596118670.jpg?w=750\" width=\"750\" height=\"501\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;This mineral is often helped to keep blood pressure regular, but it also helps to keep hormones in check.Studies have found that women with PCOS are lacking this mineral, so absorbing it by taking supplements (like&nbsp;), taking , or using&nbsp; &nbsp;may help to regulate hormones and reduce the effects of PCOS.</p>\n<h3>2. Consult a&nbsp;Aesthetician</h3>\n<p>As we all know (mainly because we\u2019re bombarded by their advertisements), there are many ways to or manually remove body hair. If you\u2019re looking to limit or remove your body hair, weigh the pros and cons of , waxing, creams and bleaches,&nbsp;laser removal, and electrolysis.Just know, that you will most likely need to keep up with whatever treatment you choose. Even laser removal (which usually stops follicles from producing hair all together) has been proven unsuccessful for many people with PCOS.Another option is to&nbsp;grow your hair out and own it! , an amazing role model for women living with PCOS, chose to grow out her bread after 39 years of hiding her body hair. She now flaunts her new look on Instagram and feels truly empowered by her choice.Bottom line: forget what other people have to say, <em><strong>the choice of what you do with your body hair is truly yours</strong></em>.</p>\n<h3>3. Exercise More</h3>\n<p>PCOS will be negatively affecting your metabolism and causing weight gain, as we covered above. So the best way to fight back and regulate your metabolism? &nbsp;HARD.If you have PCOS, you should try a 15-30 workout every day at high intensity \u2013 meaning you should break a sweat within the first few minutes. You may also want to try resistance training to further impact your metabolism.Consult your doctor first to see where you should begin exercising based on your fitness level.</p>\n<h3>4. Change Your Diet</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/tiphero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salmon-Edited.jpg?w=750\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Certain foods will raise hormone and insulin levels, only aggravating your symptoms further. So the best change to make first and foremost is a&nbsp;dietary one.For managing insulin levels, look for low-glycemic foods and eat plenty of leafy greens, fresh fruits, lean meats, and &nbsp;Avoid processed foods, dairy, and soy products, all&nbsp;of which can cause spikes in insulin levels and worsen symptoms.</p>\n<h3>5. Talk to a Therapist</h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re living with PCOS, you not only are experiencing a lot of dramatic hormonal shifts, but you\u2019re also struggling with how society views you. You may feel ashamed, unattractive, or out of control, feelings which will only heighten your anxiety or depression.Seek professional counseling if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed. They will act as a positive outlet to express your frustrations and help you learn how to cope with life\u2019s daily challenges.</p>\n<h3>6. Talk to Your Doctor</h3>\n<p>Finally, talking to your doctor is always a good thing. Your physician can not only confirm if your symptoms are PCOS, but they may be able to offer you a medical treatment to the condition, too.As we said, there is no cure for PCOS, but there are medicines you can take to help keep your hormones level and reduce symptoms. Talk to your doctor about finding the right medication for you. As with all things, make sure you consult your doctor before trying any treatments for PCOS. Just because you think the symptoms line up with your experience, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean PCOS&nbsp;is the underlying issue!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;source &gt;tiphero.com//lifestyle&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "by  Jeff John Roberts for Fortune.com\n\nIt was only a matter of time until someone made a TV show featuring bitcoin. Well, that show is here in the form of a 10-episode series called Startup, and, frankly, it does a good job of depicting the weird world of crypto-currency.\n\nThe show is set in Miami and (surprise!) involves drug dealers and an FBI agent as well as a brilliant young Stanford drop-out, Izzy Morales, who tries to convince people how digital money will change the world.\n\nThe young coder is actually flogging something called \u201cGen-Coin,\u201d which she claims is better than the original bitcoin, but is based on the same idea of a decentralized digital currency beyond the reach of banks and governments. In Izzy\u2019s eyes, while money can corrupt people, the bigger issue is that \u201cpeople corrupt money.\u201d\n\nThis scene and other ones do a good job in portraying the philosophical case for digital money, as well as some of the technology involved. (Izzy\u2019s ex-boyfriend, for instance, is unhappy about the giant electricity bills she runs up.)\n\nStartup gets it tech cred in part because the producers retained a fin-tech consultant, Brian Stoeckert, who provided advice about the world of bitcoin as well as issues like money laundering and off-shore accounts. In an interview, Stoeckert said the writers and cast were brand new to bitcoin but soon came to understand it.\n\nAs for the show overall, I only watched the first episode but would give it a 7/10. The tech scenes are probably the best part, which is why it\u2019s a shame so much of the episode is consumed by drug cliches and superfluous sex scenes. It feels like being at a party where people keep taking their clothes off, though you wish you wouldn\u2019t. (You can read full reviews of Startup at the New York Times and Variety).\n\nStartup appears on Sony\u2019s streaming platform Crackle, best known for Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s Comedians in Cars, and also stars Martin Freeman of Fargo fame as a sensitive finance bro who decides to funnel his drug dealer daddy\u2019s money into Izzy\u2019s venture.\n\nThe show is unlikely be the definitive on-screen account of bitcoin. (For that we\u2019re going to have to wait for a studio to take on the saga of Dread Pirate Roberts and the Silk Road.) But it\u2019s worth a watch for anyone into tech and digital money.",

I think so but more of that in a later post. &nbsp;For now consider the possibility of Silver regaining and exceeding previous 2011 highs after a 78% pullback from those highs. &nbsp;Food for thought from @soundmoney.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/gCv8i6BJ/\" width=\"916\" height=\"560\"/></p>\n</html>",

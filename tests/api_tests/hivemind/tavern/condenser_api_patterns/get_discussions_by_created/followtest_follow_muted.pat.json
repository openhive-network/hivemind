    "body": "<center>https://i.imgsafe.org/82405681e4.jpeg</center>\n\nMany millenia ago, certain people started to work with herbs and other plants, healing the bodies and souls of their tribespeople. Over time, they learnt how to use certain plants to form a connection with some deep part of their unconscious, tapping into wisdom of unknown origin, which would, slowly but surely, affect the fate of humanity. Some shamans claim they contact spirits, and by using psychedelic drugs, they can come into contact with the divine.\n\nIn this episode, Kurt had a chance to catch up with Luis Fernando Mises at Anarchapulco 2016 and discuss shamanism. We discussed the contrast between San Pedro/huachuma and ayahuasca \u2013 how huachuma is like a patient grandfather who is ready to work with you at your own pace, and how ayahuasca is like a stern granddmother; how huachuma gave Luis a master\u2019s degree on economic policy, how the roles of shaman, consultant and gun-owner are more harmonious than it might seem at first, and how psychedelic medicine can have a domino or fractal effect through many lives.\n\n<a href=\"http://theparadiseparadox.com/audio/paradise-paradox-ep-95-luis-fernando-mises-shamans-guns.mp3\">To download the audio, right click and press \"save as\"</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jJO-NwsjWw\n\n\n\n*This is a repost from our site http://www.theparadiseparadox.com.

    "body": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/493806472564711424/rMuSXKi6.png\nTwo things:\n\n1) 24/7 trading.  You can buy shoes at 3 a.m. but you can't buy Exxon stock.  The reason that you can't is because right now when you buy Exxon stock from a broker, you aren't really buying Exxon stock.  When you buy Exxon stock, the broker issues you an IOU, and then in a few days, the brokers transfer stocks with each other.  The trouble with this system is that it means that you have to close down the stock market each day, and you have to keep it shut because, when the brokers compare notes, they often find something off, and people spend hours dealing with it.\n\n2) Where's my money?  True story.  I ask for a bank transfer in HK.  I actually type in the number for an invalid account.  Because it is between two banks, I have to make three or four bank visits, and ask them where's my money.  They have to look through their records, and it turns out that each bank says that the other banks has my money.  The fact that the two banks literally have their headquarters right next to each other, means that I only had to spend two weeks to figure out what is going on.  Now if one of the banks was outside of HK, I'd been totally stuffed.\n\nNow with blockchain, all of the transfers go into a distributed database.  With my key, I should be able to see all of the transfers I made, and if one goes wrong, I know where my money is.\n\nThis stuff can be costly.  Once you reduce the cost of settlement so that you can send small payments cross-border, then a lot of opportunities open up.  I'm trying to do USD 1000 shipments of coffee.  The reason that you don't have special branded coffee is purely a payments issue.",

Traditionally, \"SoFloridians\" have always had a chip on their shoulder since LeBron left. It's not like they didn't appreciate LeBron, it's just the way he announced his return to Cleveland. He left with out alerting anyone in the higher ups, leaving The Heat to fend for themselves during the off season, causing a significant drop off in our winning culture. Not only that, the taunting that most franchises will go through after Cleveland fans realize they're the best team in the NBA. There's going to come a time where the memories that LeBron left in South Florida will be overshadowed by his new found success in Cleveland. And that is what causes the resentment.",

    "body": "I saw this post and thought it would be useful with a BitAsset twist ;)\n\nJames Turk:  \u201cIt is getting very ugly for the big banks, Eric. The price of many bank shares are in clear downtrends, particularly the European banks. Many of them are being swamped by unsecured loans that will never be repaid and will therefore have to be written-off as total losses.\n\nThe country in worst shape is probably Italy. The banks there have non-performing loans \u2013 which are those that are impaired and not meeting the original borrowing terms \u2013 that in the aggregate dwarf total bank equity. Even worse, non-performing loans in Italian banks have risen again over the past year from 17% to 18%. It is hard to imagine that 18% of all loans within that country are non-performing, but the Italian economy is in trouble as evidenced by its 11.7% unemployment rate. \n\nSpain, Portugal and others have growing bad debt problems in their banks too, and we have to recognize that these bad debts may be insurmountable. That\u2019s because the bad debts in many banks are larger than the bank\u2019s capital, so they can\u2019t take these losses because it would wipe out their book equity. In other words, many banks are insolvent because the difference between the true value of their assets and the value at which they are reported on bank balance sheets is in the aggregate greater than the shareholder equity of the bank. \n\nSo we have to remember not to be misled just because these banks are still open for business. Even though many of them are insolvent, they remain liquid because of the largesse of the European Central Bank, which bends over backwards to keep insolvent banks from failing because of the alternative choices when they do fail.\n\nEither the government bails out the bank, or depositors do like occurred in Cyprus and Greece with bail-ins and other schemes that cause losses to depositors or prevent them from withdrawing their money. But the situation in the US is not much better, as we can see on the following chart.\n\n![gold](https://s5.postimg.org/s5evkat53/delinquency.jpg)\n\nThis chart from the Federal Reserve shows the year-over-year rate of change of delinquent loans owed to US banks. The chart was just  recently updated through January 2016, meaning it lags by 6 months and therefore does not capture the weak economic conditions so far this year, which I expect have worsened delinquencies. \n\nWhen the rate of change crosses zero, it has been a good indicator of recessions. Importantly, it is now signaling that a recession is beginning, providing more evidence that supports the same conclusion from a variety of other economic indicators. The upshot is that counterparty risk is likely to gain increasing attention in the months ahead. In fact, I think that a rush to safety has already begun.\n\nWe clearly see the rush to safety in alternatives outside of the banking system such as the rising price of Bitcoin, which rose another 4% last week and has nearly doubled in price from its January low. And the rising price of gold and silver this year indicates that the precious metals are benefiting too. \n\nBut here\u2019s the scary part: If these early indicators about bank problems are correct, and I believe that they are, we face another 2008-type crisis for the simple reason that debts today are much bigger and therefore more unmanageable than they were eight years ago. Huge debt loads and bank non-performing loans in a slowing economy promise a train wreck.\"\n\nEDIT : http://kingworldnews.com/the-world-is-headed-for-another-terrifying-collapse-and-heres-the-scary-part/\n\nMy own opinion is fortunately we know how to get to the other side of the valley and make some wealth - buy some BitGold/BitSilver. After all, they are the ultimate safe havens and with BitShares there is NO COUNTERPARTY RISK.",

    "body": "Really interesting extract from an article I found written by Vinny Lingham. It raises some pretty compelling points on why Bitcoin represents an investment opportunity, even now after a 60% in the last 2 months. Be interested to hear others thoughts...\n\nThe coming short squeeze\n\nThe most important driver of the pending price surge, in my opinion, is going to be what I term as the \"mother&*!er of all short squeezes\".\n\nA short squeeze is basically what happens when people that are short selling an asset discover that the price has risen and they need to buy (cover) to ensure they do not make further losses.\n\nIn the bitcoin world, this happens under a number of scenarios.\n\nTraders and speculators who have taken a view that the bitcoin price will go lower could borrow coins via exchanges and sell those coins into the market, waiting for the price to drop to buy them back cheaper, repay the exchange and make a profit.\n\nMiners would normally want to lock in profits through \"hedging\", because they produce enough coins per day that they are able to pay out of their future production. However, halving day is approaching.\n\nHalving day is the day that a certain block number is reached and the rewards per block are cut in half (to 12.5 BTC per block, from the current 25 BTC). This is expected to take place in early July of this year.\n\nThis poses a problem for miners if they are trying to lock in their profits right now by borrowing and selling coins, which they intend to repay after halving day. Unless they have spare bitcoins lying around, they will be forced to buy coins on the open market if they cannot produce enough through their mining operations.\n\nIt\u2019s the same as selling crops in the futures market and then being hit by a storm that wipes out half of your fields. The only way, technically, that this doesn\u2019t happen, is if the price doubles on halving day (it won\u2019t).\n\nBecause bitcoin trades at the margin (which means that only a percentage of the total coins issued are traded), there is less liquidity and extreme changes like a 50% drop in the rewards per block will have a more marked impact on the price than one would expect, triggering a short squeeze.\n\nOne would argue that the market has already factored this in, but it hasn\u2019t. The reason is that the hash rate will fluctuate very rapidly over the halving day period, and that is going to cause a lot of volatility for miners and traders. Also, the true deflationary rate of bitcoin is not known, as I will now explain.\n\nReal inflation vs nominal inflation\n\nBitcoin was created as \"deflationary\" currency. The total supply is 21m units and it will never be changed. There are about 15.5m BTC in circulation and about 3,600 new coins minted per day, so roughly 100,000/coins per month, which amounts to nominal inflation (relative to actual coins issued) of around 8% per year.\n\nThis will arguably drop to 4% after halving day. Or will it?\n\nIf we assume that 4m BTC will not move anytime soon, then the active circulation of bitcoin is closer to 12m coins (based upon coins in issue today). Assuming that we are minting 100,000 bitcoins per month, then real inflation is at 10%, not 8%. So, if halving day takes effect, then real inflation drops to around 5%/year.\n\nBased upon research by John Ratcliff, I\u2019d like to construct a new view of the real inflation rate of bitcoin. For various reasons, it appears that 25% of bitcoins are not in active circulation (lost, cold storage, Satoshi, etc). This is even if we assume Craig Wright is Satoshi (which would mean his coins won\u2019t move until 2020). All numbers are rounded.\n\nIn 2014, bitcoin nominal inflation was 10.3% and real inflation was 15.1%\nIn 2015, bitcoin nominal inflation was 9.3% and real inflation was 10.1%\nIn 2016, bitcoin inflation will be 6.4% and real inflation will be 8.7%\nIn 2017, bitcoin inflation will be 4% and real inflation will be 5.3%.\nInflation in bitcoin has an interestingly different application than inflation in the real world, in that prices aren\u2019t going up because governments are printing money. Prices are going up because of scarcity (supply/demand).\n\nIf you note that real \"inflation\" is dropping nearly two-thirds in around just three years, it means that for the current volume of bitcoin buying to be satisfied, bitcoin will need to find a new, and higher equilibrium point and clearing price.\n\nI don\u2019t think these calculations have been adequately factored into the market price.\n\nComing arms race\n\nThe realization that bitcoin is a strategic global asset will trigger an \"arms race\".\n\nCurrently, the market cap of bitcoin ($7bn) is simply too small to facilitate a large buy of bitcoins from any governmental organization. If bitcoin started to surge globally, it could become of strategic interest to a government, and therefore other governments. I believe this would trigger something akin to a digital commodity race.\n\nImagine if China started buying up large amounts of bitcoin \u2013 would the rest of the world governments stand idly by and watch? I don\u2019t think so \u2013 so my prediction here is that by 2017, governments will become the largest buyers of bitcoin, pushing the price up to new highs.\n\nIt\u2019s always easy to make outlandish predictions. My goal for this post was to outline what I think the tailwinds are behind bitcoin.\n\nI don\u2019t know if the price is going to $1,000 or $10,000 \u2013 but I do know that it is going up. If I was forced to predict, I would say that it would hit $1000+ in 2016 and $3000+ in 2017.\n\n(http://www.coindesk.com/2016%E2%80%8A-brought-bitcoin-awakening/)",

    "body": "Blockchain tech is just a solution to the Byzantine General's Problem.  It's utility is that it allows people who don't trust each other to nonetheless reach consensus on the state of the network/ledger.  But, it doesn't prohibit people who do trust each other from acting in a coordinated way (that is, colluding) to either protect the viability of the network itself or to attack it.  When done to attack the network, such collusion is commonly called a \"51% attack\".  When done to support it, it's commonly called a \"fork\".  \n\nFor me, the question is which threatens the future viability of the blockchain most--reversing a series of transactions that resulted from a hacker exploiting an obvious coding error, thereby prohibiting a thief from stealing lots of coins or 2) insisting that \"code is law\" and that no transaction, not even those that result from obvious and extremely costly mistakes, should ever be reversed.\n\nI argue that refusing to reverse via a fork, and thereby refusing to honor the original expectations of the DAO participants and developers, does the more damage to the network than forking would. If this particular exploit had been known with certainty to every DAO participant in advance, how many of them would have actually put money into the DAO?  Easy answer:  Few to none.  And, if such hidden exploits are likely to exist in the future and participants have absolutely no recourse, how many are likely to invest in the future?  Fewer.  Much fewer.  \n\nInsisting that \"code is law\" and refusing to correct via soft or hard forks what we now know was obviously a coding error is essentially to insist that every single smart contract in the future will serve as a \"trap for the unwary\", with the \"unwary\" being essentially anyone who can't read code for themselves (and even a large portion of those who can).  Note that taking this approach creates a perverse incentive for unethical smart contract developers to \"build in\" obfuscated backdoors that the developer himself/herself eventually intends to exploit.  \n\nEven if we assume naively that all developers will act in good faith, the fact is that virtually ALL software has SOME exploitable bugs, even audited software and even open source software.  Smart contracts are ultimately just software, software that cannot be edited, and every one of them that is sufficiently complex will likely be buggy.  \n\nIf the Ethereum community's position is going to be that there is never any recourse for buggy software because \"code is law\", even buggy code, then it's future growth and success relies upon expectations of the impossible:  That programmers will suddenly begin to consistently write complex code that is bug free, or that the market will suddenly get much, much better at knowing in advance which software is buggy and which is not.  Neither of these are likely absent major innovation.  \n\nIn short, my contention is that market participants will respect and value that the Ethereum community independently chose to prevent a thief from undermining every single DAO participant's original expectations to the thief's great advantage.  Reversing things via a fork will instill confidence in the system, leading to continued growth and investment.  Failing to remedy the situation will result in the opposite:  A permanent loss of confidence and decreased growth and investment.  \n\nDoes this mean that we will have a hard or soft fork every time we discover a bug in a smart contract?  Obviously that won't be possible once there are thousands or millions of smart contracts running.  And, in some cases, it will be much less clear whether or not the software in question was in fact \"buggy\" or instead functioning as intended.  Even so, just because the Ethereum community won't always be able to intervene to fix an error doesn't mean that it should not do so in this instance where the facts are clear, the error is obvious, and the amount at stake is large.  \n\nDisclosure:  I do hold some ether, but I'm not a participant in the DAO.",

    "body": "Hello innovators and pioneers of the new social media economy!  I'm so very thrilled to see where this journey will take us.  It reminds me of images and books I've read about the land rush back in 1889 as I find much equivalency to homesteading! Gone are the masters of property today such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc that have no peer in the decentralized economy.  Also, this takes us back to a time when government regulations weren't so much of a drag as it is today.  Fortunes can be made by good people with good intentions without the burden of complying with regulations that are for bad people with bad intentions.  Thank you steemit for giving the power and the economy back to the people.\n\nI like to keep my privacy, but I will say that I was first introduced to the bitcoin blockchain technology via Coursera!  Coursera still has a course, I believe, in startup engineering which used bitcoins as a means to measure how well your web app performed.  This was back in 2013, I think!   I'm also a systems and software engineer for DoD and, interestingly enough, DARPA is funding a small business topic on utilizing the blockchain technology as the basis for implementing a peer-to-peer, DDoS resistant, private, and robust messaging framework for operators, command nets, and consumers of their intelligence.\n\nPeace out, k-rapper.",

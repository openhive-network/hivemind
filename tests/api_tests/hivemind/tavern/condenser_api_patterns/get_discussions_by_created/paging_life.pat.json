    "body": "<html>\n<p><strong>Memoir of a runaway girl - A true story!</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/und8f4oet/stock_illustration_2013520_hitchhiker_girl.jpg\" width=\"190\" height=\"146\"/></p>\n<p>&nbsp;There, on the floor, was Ann naked and on her knees. I will not get into details of what they did to her because it was horrifying to say the least. I closed my eyes and tears were just streaming down my cheeks. They kept saying \u201c<strong>Open your eyes and watch, because you\u2019re next</strong>\u201d. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/bw4vrm7tr/bound_and_gagged.jpg\" width=\"289\" height=\"320\"/></p>\n<p>After about twenty minutes or so, which felt like a full day to me, they threw me back into the room and I panicked. I worked feverishly on that window trying to open it. I was aware that the only way I was going to escape this horror was to jump out of that window but it had to be done without breaking it. &nbsp;If I broke the window, they\u2019d surely hear me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the dresser was an old metal comb that I used to pry the nails up. This method worked, it allowed me to loosen the nails and wiggle them back and forth until they could be pulled out by hand. Luckily there were only three nails or I would have never been able to get that window open. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I jumped out of the window and ran bare foot without looking back once. I ran through ditches along the highway, knowing that if they were out looking for me I needed to stay low. This was no easy task since I had no shoes on, but my life depended on my getting away as quickly as I could. Eventually I made my way to the road, stuck my thumb out, luckily I was picked up pretty fast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When we got into town I asked them to take me to my friend Theresa\u2019s house, I knew she would have a change of clothes and shoes for me. After changing and getting cleaned up I had no idea what I was going to do, because I knew they would be out looking for me. They obviously found Ann, and it was a matter of time before they found me again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I ended up calling an old boyfriend, Frank, and asked if he could take me to Edmonton and he agreed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A valuable lesson was learned, when parents tell you something is bad, or should be avoided, it is usually for good reason. I should have listened. When you are young, you think you know everything and will do what you want without thinking about the possible consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/7c73d0mbz/overflowing_suitcase.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"220\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I had only one small suitcase with some clothes my girlfriend gave me. Frank came and got me and we drove five hours to Edmonton. Once there I went back to the area where I knew people. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was when I met Miguel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Miguel was Portuguese and tanned and seemed like such a nice guy. I liked him instantly, I thought we would end up as great friends, but as it turned out, he ended up being my boyfriend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Miguel introduced his sister in law Doris to me. Quickly I ended up moving in with her as a roommate. Now this was already a disturbing time in my life and it wasn't about to get any better. &nbsp;&nbsp;A friendship from hell was born, and I will explain why. &nbsp;Doris was married with a child, living separate from her husband and daughter, because she could not control her hormones and had many affairs. &nbsp;She wore mostly mens clothing that were all too baggy for her. Her hair was long and blond and she stood maybe four inches taller then me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She told me the story as to why she was living away from her child. She and Miguel were at Doris\u2019s home one day, while her husband was at work. One thing led to another and the two of them ended up in bed together. Her husband, Terry, came home, and found the front door was double locked and he could not get into the apartment. She refused to let him in. Her daughter was in the crib crying with all of the commotion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/6egwz52ih/cryingbaby.jpg\" width=\"170\" height=\"136\"/></p>\n<p>Her husband went back to his car and waited in the parking lot before trying again. &nbsp;In a hurry to get out before &nbsp;Terry came back, Doris and Miguel packed up a bag, and both of them had left the apartment leaving the crying toddler behind, unattended. &nbsp;Several hours passed, and Terry figured he\u2019d try again. As soon as he reached the apartment door, he could hear his daughter wailing. He was luckily able to get into the apartment this time and he ran to pick up his sobbing daughter and carried her around looking for his wife. She was nowhere to be found.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank &nbsp;you for your support and continued reading.</p>\n<p>If you missed the beginning of my book you can find it here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/writing/@feline1991/a-steemit-original-a-lifetime-of-seeking-happiness-part-1\">https://steemit.com/writing/@feline1991/a-steemit-original-a-lifetime-of-seeking-happiness-part-1</a> &nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

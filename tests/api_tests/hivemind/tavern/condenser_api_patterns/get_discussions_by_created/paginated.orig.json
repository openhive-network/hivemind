There, I was with fifteen other souls, all of us intently hammering away at solving the world\u2019s problems in a nice quite \u201cstudy-hall\u201d environment.  Suddenly the placid quietude was shattered by one person initiating a video conference with several colleagues, sans headphones.  She and her colleagues talked and laughed loudly; completely oblivious to the fact that they were disrupting everyone around them.\n\nFrom the dark looks, loud sighs and other non-verbal communication, it was obvious that everyone was annoyed.  I managed to survive about seven minutes of her auditory assault before summoning the will to approach her with a bleeding edge new concept\u2026 headphones.  I have captured the essence of the exchange below.\n\n\u2022\t**the-ultimatum** (**TU**)\n\u2022\t**Rude Shrew** (**RS**)\n\n> \u2022\t**TU**: \u201cWould you like to borrow these?\u201d\n \n_I extend my arm out revealing a set of headphones with a built in mic._\n> \u2022\t**RS**: [incoherent stammering while she tried to ignore me.  She responds to her colleagues]\n\n_I sweep the room with my extended arm_\n> \u2022\t**TU**: \u201cWe are all trying to work\u2026 you are more than welcome to these\u201d\n\n_She turns to me with a look of utter confusion_\n> \u2022\t**RS**: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to use those.\u201d\n\n_A lifetime of training in self-control is being challenged in this solitary moment.  A look of incredulity sweeps over my face_\n> \u2022\t**TU**: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to plug-in and put on headphones\u2026?\u201d\n\n_[End of conversation.]_\n\n**As she continued to interrupt everyone I started to do some research and below is the content of this post.**\n\n**A Step-by-Step Guide to: Remotely Shutdown a Computer on a Shared Network**\nFollowing the steps & screenshots below you will find a very fast very simple way to boot users off a shared network or play pranks on your friends. \n\n\u2022\tFind the **cmd** prompt & _run as admin_\n\u2022\tType the command: **net view**\n\nThis will show you all the names of computers on the same network. The hardest part is targeting your subject\u2019s computer name. Trial and error.\n\n![CMD](https://anonimag.es/i/aacbbb1c18515bf66837d975858fee63.jpg)\n\nOnce you have chosen your subject follow the next steps:\n\u2022\tType the command: **ping [comp. name]**\n\n![PING](https://anonimag.es/i/0713224e9d0de131e979b0aa33ead35f.jpg)\n\n\u2022\tType the command: **shutdown -i**\n\n![SDi](https://anonimag.es/i/a3f83e1d32b2e6d54c9b0bdfa0fcb0ca.jpg)\n\nIn the **command prompt**:\n\u2022\tLeft click\n\u2022\tSelect _mark_\n\u2022\tCopy IP Address (e.g. _fe80::ddc9:3651:2554:3a93%2_)\n\nIn the **shutdown -i** pane follow these steps:\n\u2022\tPaste into _ADD_\n\u2022\tChoose _Shutdown_\n\u2022\tLeave Checked _Warn users of the action_\n\u2022\tSet the _Warn users of the action_ timer to a desired time.\n\u2022\tUncheck _Planned_\n\u2022\tChoose option _Security issue (unplanned)_\n\u2022\tType in your own _Comment_ (e.g. \"Your computer has been locked.

    "body": "# Is The Takeover of Crypto-Currencies About to Begin by the Central Banks?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NxCYMpy.png\n([Image Source](http://www.e-corp-usa.com/ecoin/))\n\nThe show **Mr. Robot** has fictionalized the **\"Powers that Shouldn't Be\"** into a singular Corporation called **E Corp**. This E Corp is supposed to basically represent the powers behind the Global Central Bankers, the true World Rulers. The head of E Corp even states in a recent Episode \"Politicians are Puppets\", which reminds me of the quotation by Nathan Rothschild regarding the head on which the crown of England is placed. Clearly one could see that E Corp in the show is the fictionalization of the **\"Illuminati\"** if you will. The show is heavily laden with [esoteric symbolism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2lZn-ZcJMs) but to the public it comes across as \"counter-culture\" as the main character is the founding member of **\"F Society\"** a hacking group based directly on **\"Anonymous\"**. This hacking group causes a financial crash, which leads to E Corp releasing a new digital Currency called **\"ECoin\"**, the above image is from a promotional website for the TV show. \n\n## Is Mr. Robot demonizing Crypto-Currencies? \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f6gXhrn.jpg\n([Image Source](http://www.serialminds.com/2015/06/05/mr-robot-la-serie-che-sta-piacendo-tutti-forse-troppo/))\n\nNow the interesting part for those fans of crypto-currencies like everyone on **Steemit** and for everyone who uses **Bitcoin**. I think the reason for they added an \"Ecoin\" in this show is to demonize crypto-currencies. The powers that shouldn't be have no way to take over these crypto-currencies so they have decided to wage information war against them. With the countless videos warning about the rise of *\"digital only currency\"* being the *\"mark of the beast\"*, one could easily see lots of propaganda has already been employed. However this new form is quite intelligent, by associating \"ECoins\" with \"E Corp\" they make the average mind (who doesn't know what Bitcoin or Steemit really is), subconsciously associate all crypto-currencies with the Federal Reserve banskters, with \"E Corp\". This is classic subconscious guilt by association created entirely by fiction that is often employed in fictional movies. This is why I think the \"E Coin\" was added to the show, but I could be wrong, so why else might it be in this show? \n\n## Do the Elite Plan to Replace the Dollar with a Digital Only Currency? \nhttp://i.imgur.com/IJJxcBR.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nWe all know the financial system is basically teetering on the verge of collapse. It is the biggest ponzy scheme ever devised and like all ponzy schemes if the Federal Reserve doesn't increase demand for the use of it's currency the system will collapse. It was designed to collapse. I believe like many others for one reason, so they can start the whole process that made them so rich, all over again on a global scale. The new world order if you will, being run by financial despotism and technical autocracy. So, is their plan to create a financial collapse being shown in plain sight in this show? One idea I heard from my friend who maintains the [\"What is Real\" YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/szymborski11) is they may \n>\"allow a false flag attack that they can blame on some shadowy hacking group, possibly even **Anonymous** itself as anyone can claim to be Anonymous\" \n\nPersonally I do not buy this theory as Anonymous is completely decentralized and would be almost impossible to blame for a false flag. However, to fully analyze a situation one must always look at every angle. \n\nSo if the system collapsed, especially overnight due to a hack, would they replace the Federal Reserve Notes with a new digital only \"E Coin\" backed by the IMF World Bank and their massive Gold Holdings, and Special Drawing Rights Holdings? The Group of Thirty, also known as the G30 reported in the [latest working papers on their website](http://group30.org/publications) that they want a return to a **GOLD Standard** just like how the Federal Reserve started out but in a new **Global Currency**. See my Documentary on the [\"Group of Thirty\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOB9QfxsgdQ) for more on this group of 30 Central Bankers that meet in secret. So is it out of the realm of possibilities that the new Global Currency that the World Bank has planned for post the collapse of the Federal Reserve System is a new digital only currency based on Gold and SDR holdings? No this would make a lot of sense to me but what do you the readers think? \n\n## Decentralization the Key to Defeating Takeover of Crypto-Currencies by Central Banks\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KVNo7nE.jpg\n([Image Source](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/))\n\nThe decentralized concept at the basis of the crypto-currencies could be the key to their survival if the Central Banks decide to try and take over the market. Right now their is a few crypto-currencies that are from the perspective of a non trader even worth mentioning. **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and **STEEM**, however if the Central Banks created a new \"ECoin\" it would easily make replace Bitcoin as the number 1 crypto-currency. However, there will always be a demand for crypto-currencies that are not \"Ecoins\", because thankfully we have a whole planet full of awesome people who will never conform to the system. The useless governments will always make things illegal that people want and can't buy with their new \"Ecoins\". So we will always have a demand for a currency like Bitcoin that is not a part of the centralized system, but is outside of that system's control. So try as they might, the powers that be can only wage information war against crypto-currencies because there will always be new entrepreneurs that create new currencies just like steemit, that are outside their systems of control. The harder the hidden hand squeezes the more of us will fall through their fingertips. \n\n#### Thanks for Reading! \nhttp://i.imgur.com/k10p6Pf.jpg\nIf you liked my article please join **steemit** and let me know by leaving a comment or upvoting!

    "body": "# Deciding to do some Trading with my SBD/BTC\n\nAfter having some mild success on steemit, I decided to transfer part of my SBD to Poloniex and try my hand at trading cryptocurrencies. It all kind of feels like free money anyway! I am just learning how cryptocurrencies work. I have been interested in bitcoin as a concept and aware of its success for about 2 years now, but never owned any until I ended up owning some SBD after stumbling upon steemit.\n\nAfter transferring to poloniex, I bought some BTC with my SBD. From there I transferred some BTC to a circle account and cashed out 20$ USD to my bank account just to prove to myself and everyone that keeps asking me, that I can easily use this cryptocurrency to get cash. But, the more I learn, the less fiat money I want and the more I want to invest in silver and cryptocurrencies. \n\n# Bitcoin\n\nI have regretted not being into bitcoin ever since I heard about it and started watching it go up and then especially after hearing Jeff Berwick talk positively about it at 200$ and then seeing it go over 500$. So I was happy to finally own some BTC but this is basically all an experiment for me so I decided that I might try to play the game a bit more.\n\n# Value of Steem Going Down\n\nI can see that my steemit wallet account value has been going down. I have powered up most of my SBD and I will continue to do so because I believe in steemit in the long term, but I do think I might be able to protect my SBD and maybe even profit with it by trading into BTC and buying cryptocurrencies on Poloniex so that's what I am experimenting with. I could also lose my investment so I am starting slowly and learning as much as I can for now.\n\n# Ethereum\n\n<p><center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/ETHEREUM-YOUTUBE-PROFILE-PIC.png</p></center>\n\n[image source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum)\n\nFrom my stock chart studying experience and from advice on the internet I decided to make a bet on ETH. I have heard more about Ethereum as I have been on steemit and after a short research session online I decided that it may go up soon, so I'll buy. Keep in mind, none of this very scientific, I am just playing around and learning how to do this and am not giving any advice because I really don't know what I'm doing! \n\nCurrently, I don't have time to constantly monitor close enough to day trade so I am only going to buy something that I think will be moving up over next few weeks. I make my guess based on what the technology is and by looking for trends in the charts. My chart studying skills are pretty basic. I look for floors, ceilings, and trends based on highs and lows over time. I look for upwards trends by spotting a series of higher lows and by watching for crosses in the moving averages. That's pretty much my entire strategy at this point\n\n# Trading so far\n\nHere is what I did yesterday. I turned 100 SBD into 0.13731732 BTC. I then transferred that bitcoin to my margin account after reading about how it worked on Poloniex's [margin trading page.](https://poloniex.com/support/aboutMarginTrading/) From there I was able to buy 0.33554217 BTC worth of Ethereum so now I have a position on 17.11149722 ETH.\n\nToday I have been researching other coins to invest in. I found [this quick list](http://www.alexfortin.com/top-5-crypto-currencies-invest-2016/#comments) helpful and I have noticed on my Poloniex margin trading account there are a few coins that I can take a margin position on. I also liked this [list of cryptos by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) Several of the coins are very volatile and some are making big moves while I watch them. Probably from some FOMO, I decided to go long on CLAMs. I liked that they just gave away coins to bitcoin holders so now they are the most widely held coin. I have no idea if this will be profitable, but I decided to go for it because it's so cheap!\n\n# Other Coins\n\nI also noticed that CLAMs are the crypto for a [gambling site](https://just-dice.com/) that was featured in a very positive [huffington post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gambling-done-fairly-how-virtual-currencies-help_us_57cf8253e4b0eb9a57b6a117) and is very active. I don't gamble much except a little poker now and then and I am definitely not promoting gambling, but I do recognize it as an industry that can help support a crypto. Basically I don't gamble unless I feel like I have an advantage. \n\n<p><center>http://clamclient.com/images/bio-photo.png</p></center>\n\n[image source](http://clamclient.com/)\n\nThe only reason I feel comfortable trying my hand at cryptocurrency trading is that I am using very small amounts of money that I earned from writing content in my spare time and I think the risk is worth the reward because I believe like many of you that cryptocurrency is the future of currency and if I get in on the right one early enough, there could be a nice profit. Now all I have to do is predict the future, lol.\n\nI have also noticed XRM making big upward swings today and I am considering playing with it but I am a bit weary putting much into coins that I don't really believe in. Yes I am doing this with CLAMs but I am going to keep this type of investment to a minimum. Still, I am open to any recommendations from any of you crypto traders out there might have.\n\n# Conclusions and Questions\n\nI have been teeter tottering between red and green on both of my positions but I feel confident that I will be able to close my positions at a profit at this point. I think I am going to stay long on Ethereum with most of my Poloniex account and move in and out of some small cap cryptos with a small percentage of my balance. But this is just my initial thoughts on my strategy so I am open to changing my entire strategy as I learn. The title is a serious question - Should I stay long on ETH??? It makes sense to me to do that but I could be missing something. Does anyone have any tips on coins that are going to make some big moves???\n\nI am a newbie at all this so please point out anything stupid I may be doing. I welcome any advice and suggestions that any of you might have. I'm also happy to answer any questions you might have if your like me and just getting started trading cryptos. I hope if nothing else, this post starts a conversation and something is learned. Thanks for reading. Let's make some money!\n\n# Links\n\n[Poloniex's margin trading page.](https://poloniex.com/support/aboutMarginTrading/) \n\n[gambling site for CLAMs](https://just-dice.com/)\n\n [huffington post article about that gambling site ^^^^^^^](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gambling-done-fairly-how-virtual-currencies-help_us_57cf8253e4b0eb9a57b6a117)\n\n[list of cryptos to consider for investment](http://www.alexfortin.com/top-5-crypto-currencies-invest-2016/#comments)\n\n[list of cryptos by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)",

Has somebody created a simple tool to enable a double spend?</center>\n\n<center>https://s11.postimg.org/icdsogk77/29e.jpg</center>\n##### <center>Free Bitcoin, YES!</center>\n- - - \n\nI'm guessing by now many of us have seen the video released earlier today;\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ysVCU1b-UBA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n... or read the articles that are circulating, regarding the supposed hack and tool that now allows you to simply and deliberately double-spend a bitcoin. A group of supposed \"South Korean\" hackers, who strangely seem very American seem to have put a lot of time and effort into creating a tool, website, and some marketing to discredit Bitcoin. They claim to be benevolent but its not hard to read between the lines to see a vested interest. \n- - -\n>Published on Sep 14, 2016\n\"Double-spending\" Bitcoin -- the process of making someone believe you sent them funds when you didn't -- used to be only for the tech-savvy. Thanks to Glass Hunt's new web-based double-spend tool, however, it's now easy and available to all. The South Korea-based anonymous hackers -- who actually want Bitcoin to succeed -- reveal their motives in this anonymous interview by Amanda B. Johnson.>\n- - -\n##### So...\nAnyway, the concept that a double spend could be initiated on zero confirmations transactions, seemed interesting enough and plausible enough to warrant further investigation. So I decided to follow the instructions in the video and try for myself.\n\n### <center>It all seems simple enough, just follow the guy on the video.</center>\n- - - \n# <center>3 Simple Steps:</center>\n<center>https://s17.postimg.org/6638czk4v/ds3.png</center>\n### <center>1. INITIALIZE</center>\n### <center>2. SEND FIRST BITCOIN</center>\n### <center>3. DOUBLE SPEND</center>\n- - -\n### <center>Step 1: Deposit some BTC into the Glass Hunt address given to initialize the process</center>\n<center>https://s17.postimg.org/htxa7j99r/ds2.png</center>\nI sent a small amount of Bitcoin to the address and after failing several times, it appeared in my Glass Hunt account. I was now ready to proceed to Step 2 and begin the double spend.\n\n- - -\n### <center>Step 2: Input the address where you would like to send the BTC</center>\n<center>https://s17.postimg.org/hfvy7xp67/image.png</center>\nI picked a random gaming site off the internet which accepted zero confirmation deposits and anonymity to begin gambling. I input the btc deposit address as per the instructions here...\n- - - \n### <center>Step 3:</center>\n...And that's where it ends...I can't make it past step 2 to step 3. It just keeps returning an error, and that is what it's been doing for the last 6 hours. I asked a fellow crypto associate to try the process, and they reported the same result, as do several of the comments appearing under the origonal YouTube clip which was posted.\n\nSo, is it a scam? It's too early to say for sure, or is it just somebody snubbing their nose at Bitcoin to leverage their own coin? Interested to know what others think of this situation. I have sent Glass Hunt an email and informing them of the error, and if they reply I will update this post accordingly.\n\n###### NB. I was attempting the double spend for research purposes and if successful, intended to return any coins which may have been gained as a result of the double spend.\n\nIf you would like to try for yourself then simply click on the link to go to- http://www.glasshunt.co/exploits/bitcoin-double-spend/\n\n\n\n**Click here to:** <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@bkkshadow\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/27/dd8bd8753d41da7.gif\" alt=\"dd8bd8753d41da7.gif\" border=\"0\"> </a>\n\n#bitcoin\n#cryptocurrency\n#hack",

Clelands keynote presentation was given at the second international workshop for <a href=\"http://blockchain.cs.ucl.ac.uk/p2pfisy-2016/\">P2P Financial Systems</a> in London on Sept. 8 and 9. The BoE co-sponsored the event with Bank of Canada, Deutsche Bundesbank, House of Finance, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and UCL Research Centre, bringing together scholars, regulators, and practitioners.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/bv582tdtr/image2.jpg\" width=\"907\" height=\"227\"/></center></p>\n<p>Cleland was appointed in March 2014, and her signature <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2015/031.aspx\">appears </a>on british banknotes. However, her role covers \u201cfar more than signing the banknotes,\u201d the Chief Cashier explains. \u201cI am responsible for meeting public demand for banknotes and maintaining confidence in the physical currency.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a September 2015 <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2015/speech838.pdf\">speech</a> at the University of the West of England in Bristol, Cleland stated that \u201calthough my team is responsible for a much older payment method, we are not luddites, and we welcome the additional choice and convenience that consumers can now enjoy.\u201d</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/k1x7ue3wf/image3.png\" width=\"270\" height=\"166\"/></center></p>\n<p>Cleland confirmed the Bank's research into the \u201cpotential breadth of access to CBDC\u201d at the workshop last week. She described two extreme possibilities; limiting access to only financial institutions, or giving access to everybody. The latter would allow businesses and households to \u201chold balances in central bank money and to pay each other in real time with full and final settlement, in an electronic format.\u201d Introducing a CBDC \u201ccould fundamentally change the structure of the financial system,\u201d where everyone currently uses commercial banks or other financial institutions to make electronic payments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/5k00meclb/image4.jpg\" width=\"906\" height=\"194\"/></center></p>\n<p>This is not the first time a central bank has contemplated competing with commercial banks. In November 2015, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/the-worlds-top-bank-weighs-in-on-digital-currencies/\">published a report on digital currencies</a> asserting that blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) \u201ccould present a hypothetical challenge to central banks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Increasing usage of the technology could reduce or even remove the functions of a central body. However, central banks have options to respond to the threat such as \u201cusing the technology itself to issue digital currencies,\u201d the BIS wrote.\u201cThe question is whether such digital liabilities should be issued using new technology and be made more widely available than at present.\u201d The BIS referenced the BoE and it\u2019s ongoing research.</p>\n<p>In March, the Bank's Deputy Governor of Monetary Policy, Dr. Ben Broadbent, gave a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech886.pdf\">speech</a> at the London School of Economics asserting that there are two major implications of CBDC that compete with commercial banks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/et26wilhb/image5.jpg\" width=\"907\" height=\"216\"/></center></p>\n<p>Currently, retail deposits at commercial banks are backed mainly by illiquid assets that cannot be sold on the open market. If all accounts are closed at once, banks wouldn\u2019t have the liquid resources to meet the demand. A central bank, on the other hand, \u201cholds only liquid assets on its balance sheet,\u201d Broadbent said, so they cannot run out of cash. However, he cautioned that \u201ctaking deposits away from banks could impair their ability to make the loans.\u201d</p>\n<p>In June, Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech914.pdf\">discussed</a> the prospect of CBDC for the UK at the Lord Mayor\u2019s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London. \u201cIn my view, still some way off,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/iqpglx8an/image6.jpg\" width=\"905\" height=\"224\"/></center></p>\n<p>A BoE staff working <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2016/swp605.pdf\">paper</a> on the macroeconomics of CBDC, published in July, suggests that it would be \u201ceconomically equivalent to the establishment of an online-only, reserve-backed, narrow bank alongside the existing commercial banking system.\u201d It would increase competition for deposit accounts and rapidly increase the adoption of innovative technologies and account offerings, the authors explained. CBDC could also have other advantages such as raising the country's GDP by as much as 3%, according to one of the models discussed in the paper.</p>\n<p>In a one-off inquiry into distributed ledger, or blockchain, technology at the House of Lords, also in July, a few industry experts participated including Dr. Catherine Mulligan, Research Fellow at Imperial College Centre for Cryptocurrency Research. \u201cIn terms of central bank crypto-backed fiat currency, it does have a potential impact on monetary policy,\u201d she told the Lords, citing its potential to move money away from commercial banks towards a central bank. \u201cIt's a matter of balance,\u201d she said. \u201cYou got to think about that carefully to make sure the commercial banks don't just collapse.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the same inquiry, Broadbent <a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/house-of-lords-told-bank-of-englands-digital-currency-is-some-ways-off/\">reiterates</a> the prospect of CBDC substituting commercial bank money, but concurred with Carney that it\u2019s \u201csome way off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Any central banks issuing their own digital currencies would be directly competing with commercial banks, Senior Advisor to MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative, Michael Casey, <a href=\"http://www.dtcc.com/news/2016/april/19/analyzing-the-digital-currency-revolution\">explained</a> during the \u201cBitcoin and the Digital Currency Revolution\u201d panel at the DTCC Blockchain Symposium.\u201cWhy would you hand over money to a commercial bank with all the risk that entails without any of the benefits?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have people looking to store short-term custodial funds with a central bank.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s25.postimg.org/borizq4ov/image7.jpg\" width=\"909\" height=\"169\"/></center>\n<p>The BoE is not the only central bank to consider issuing their own digital currency. Bank of Canada has also<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/bank-of-canada-looking-into-issuing-digital-currency-1.2834759\">considered</a> issuing its own digital currency.

In June, the Bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1117c780-3397-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153\">reportedly</a> gave a private presentation in Calgary unveiling its project to develop an electronic version of the Canadian dollar using a token named CAD-Coin.</p>\n<p>Digital currency is also in the works in China.

    "body": "<center>https://s11.postimg.org/v65yywpb7/bitfinex40.png</center>\n\n### Hi Steemians! This is small analysis of a potential investment opportunity in iFinex Inc. the corporate entity behind the world known trading platform Bitfinex. First some facts:\n\n### BFX Tokens\nAfter the Bitfinex security breach that occurred on August 2, 2016, Bitfinex issued tokens representing their clients losses at a face value of $1 dollar, this means that if you lost $400 dollars you would be credited 400 BFX Tokens with the promise that Bitfinex would do everything possible to redeem the tokens at its face value of $1 dollar as soon as possible.\n\n### BFX Token Trading\nA couple of days after the platform resumed operations after the hack, the trading of the BFX token was enabled under some [terms and conditions](https://www.bitfinex.com/bfx_token_terms). This meant that by then you could sell your tokens at the market value and recover a percentage of what you lost OR you could also buy the token as a long term investment if you were confident that Bitfinex was going to redeem them soon. The BFX token started trading at $0.30 USD and from then it has gone up to $0.619 (price at the moment of writing this article).\n\n<center>https://s17.postimg.org/nsvokdycf/bfxusdchart.png\nBFXUSD 6hr candle chart for the past month.\n</center>\n\n### BFX Tokens Redemption\nBitfinex announced there would be 3 possible ways the company would be redeeming the BFX tokens\n- Equity conversion\n- Raising new capital through equity financing\n- Operating Profits\n\n### Special Purpose Vehicle for Equity conversion\n**Here is where it gets interesting**, on August 22nd, Bitfinex started coordinating with BnkToTheFuture in order to launch a SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) that would allow the conversion of BFX tokens to equity stakes in iFinex (the company behind Bitfinex). 5 days ago Bitfinex finally revealed some details about this equity conversion:\n- Redemption of BFX for the beneficial interest in iFinex will be done at BFX\u2019s face value of $1 US Dollar.\n- Participation in the SPV will be limited to holders of a minimum of 1,000 BFX tokens.\n\n<center>https://s9.postimg.org/e1jbvmyjj/letter.png</center>\n\n### Bitfinex remains a Profitable company and the most complex Trading Platform.\nEven though the trading volume suffered a big drop after the security breach, it has been recovering since then. The sole fact of seeing this trading volume in their platform immediately after the hack shows how confident people are that this will not happen again. Something what we should keep in mind is that Bitfinex continues to be most complex Trading Platform for the trading pairs that they offer, they have margin trading, margin funding and several other features in their platform. I also think that the trading volume will not go anywhere but up because people will slowly regain confidence on the platform as the time goes by.\n\n<center>https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/4/005/0aa/28b/3d33285.jpg</center>\n\n## IFINEX INC. EQUITY AT 40% DISCOUNT!\nSince the BFX tokens equity conversion would be done at their face value of $1 US Dollar and at the moment of writing, the BFX token is trading at $0.618 USD, if you are confident on the future success of Bitfinex and are willing to invest on it, you could buy BFX tokens right now and once the SVP for equity conversion is live you would be **getting iFinex equity at a 38% discount!**\n\nMy thoughts are that once the SVP is officially announced, the BFX Token price could easily go up to $0.70 or $0.80 and once the SVP is live for equity conversion it could get really close to its face value, why? well simply because there will be a lot of investors out there trying to get Bitfinex equity at a discount. Also since the BFX Token would be the only way of getting iFinex Inc. equity (since equity could not be available through regular USD), we could even see the BFX Token price go pass its face value if there are a lot of investors confident on Bitfinex and wanting to get a piece of the cake. Of course this all depends on the actual terms and conditions of the SVP and the offered Equity.\n\n### Any thoughts?\nI am really interested on hearing your thoughts about this? What do you think about this opportunity? Would you invest in Bitfinex even after they suffered a security breach? Do you think the platform still has potential? After all, like I mentioned before, it remains the most complex Bitcoin Trading Platform out there. I think this all depends on whether you think the company will be successful in the long term or not.\n\n### Disclaimer\nThis is in no way an investment advice nor an attempt of pumping the BFX token value, this is merely the presentation of the facts and an attempt to know your thoughts about this potential investment opportunity.\n\n### Hope you find this analysis interesting and that you decide to share your thoughts on this. Thanks for reading and bye for now.",

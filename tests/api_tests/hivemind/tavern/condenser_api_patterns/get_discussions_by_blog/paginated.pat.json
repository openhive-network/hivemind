    "body": "<p>In order to solve the problem of the 1%, we have been trying to raise wealth for the middle and lower class. \u00a0This has been done by creating more jobs and raising the minimum wage. \u00a0But maybe that is not the right way to go about it. \u00a0You can increase the wealth as much as you want, but if the cost rises with it, you will be stuck with the same problem. \u00a0However if you decrease the cost of things that people can use to increase their wealth as well the decrease the cost of living, it can lead to a better dispursion of wealth. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Regardless of where you are in the world, odds are that minimum wage needs to be increased. \u00a015 dollars an hour should not be something that may happen in the future. \u00a0It is too difficult for people to live of those wages and even if they do manage to get by, it limits the growth potentional when all their time is spent working dead-end jobs that care not for the growth of their employees. \u00a0But increasing the wages as inflation increases is not enough. \u00a0There is no progress here but only a side-step. \u00a0And worse when it doesn't happen, it makes it harder for people who are struggling. \u00a0There needs to be an influx of cash distrubtion to the lower class if we are to see a fairer system. \u00a0The problem is that money has to come from somwhere and although the wealthy should be giving back, if the people who had money were inclined to give it, they would have done so already (maybe one day). \u00a0There is the government, which can go a long way in helping to spread the wealth better, but we have yet to fix a system where the 1% thrive. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>What if everything that you needed was free? \u00a0Imagine you didn't have to pay for food, or water, housing or electricity. \u00a0Or the internet. \u00a0How about education? \u00a0Think about how much it would free you to work on the field of your choice and actually improve in that field if you are more focused on the work than the money. \u00a0I'm not saying to eliminate wealth, if people want to spend their money on a fancy sports car, that is their choice, but everyone should be able to afford transport. \u00a0If wealth is to stay (which looks like the way it will be as those with wealth will not want to just rid of their wealth) that does not mean you have to penalize those at the bottom. \u00a0Money is a useless frivilous thing and if it is used to buy useless frivilous things is one thing, but when it is needed to eat and warm yourself we have a problem. \u00a0If we can make the world more afforable for everyone it will lead to more opportunites for the lower class while still letting the super-rich keep their wealth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/f3n3jo8uz/Mon.jpg\" /></p>",

    "body": "<p>It was on New Years Eve. \u00a0I was spending the night with a friend, nothing too exciting, when out of the blue I could not hear out of my left ear. \u00a0I mean nothing. \u00a0So being a bit of a worrier, I wanted to fix it ASAP. \u00a0I went to the washroom and grabbed a Qtip. \u00a0I figured it was just a little clogged, I would clean it out and that would be that. \u00a0But the Qtip did nothing. \u00a0So I went back to what I was doing. \u00a0It was only a clog, it would clear itself out eventually. \u00a0But then the pain started. \u00a0Not a gentle irritation but a painful throbbing. \u00a0Like, I need to go to the hospital kind of pain. \u00a0So that is what I ended up doing. \u00a0I sat in the emergency waiting room as my ear ached. \u00a0I don't remember how long it took but it was some time before I made it in a room (a first hand experience of just one reason why we need to increase funding to hospitals). \u00a0There was nothing they could do. \u00a0They gave me a perscription for some asprin threes, which did little to nothing to help. \u00a0I had to wait it out. \u00a0It was a long day after where I could barely sleep. \u00a0Eventually the pain started to go away in waves and became less and less severe. \u00a0But even then it still took months before my hearing returned to normal. \u00a0It was odd showering and hearing the water like it was going through a filter. \u00a0What I think might of happened was I had a infection that I ended up pushing back with the Qtip into a part of the ear that was smaller and tighter. \u00a0Which lead to a painful couple of days. \u00a0So in conclusion, no matter how much you start to panic when you can't hear out of one of your ears, DO NOT stick anything in it. \u00a0They have that warning on the Qtip box for a reason.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/pohfcxls5/qtip.jpg\" /></p>",

You know the ones. \u00a0The ones that hope the three outs pass before the ball makes it to the outfield. \u00a0Come on strike-out! \u00a0I like to hit the ball, but the whole catching and throwing thing was not for me. \u00a0I couldn't kick in soccer and apparently you need something called co-ordination for tennis. \u00a0Basketball required dribbling, so that was out and football was a time to chill on the bench. \u00a0I never played rugby but I'm sure I would suck at it. \u00a0Golf is a no unless it is mini. \u00a0Surfing involves balance and I would sink like a stone at the first wave. \u00a0Skateboarding lead to ripped pants and scrapped knees. \u00a0I was not winning an olympic medal when we did our track and field events in school. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hockey, ha! \u00a0I was happy if I didn't fall on my ass when I was skating. \u00a0I was not bad at bowling, so that is something. \u00a0The point is (if there is a point) is if you did suck at sports, you are not alone. \u00a0I wanted to be on the bench with a pad and a pencil drawing. \u00a0So if you are or were like me, don't sweat it, find your own ways to stay in shape, eat right and embarce your lack of strength, speed and co-ordination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/z4vpfnm91/baseball.jpg\" /></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>It was on New Years Eve. &nbsp;I was spending the night with a friend, nothing too exciting, when out of the blue I could not hear out of my left ear. &nbsp;I mean nothing. &nbsp;So being a bit of a worrier, I wanted to fix it ASAP. &nbsp;I went to the washroom and grabbed a Qtip. &nbsp;I figured it was just a little clogged, I would clean it out and that would be that. &nbsp;But the Qtip did nothing. &nbsp;So I went back to what I was doing. &nbsp;It was only a clog, it would clear itself out eventually. &nbsp;But then the pain started. &nbsp;Not a gentle irritation but a painful throbbing. &nbsp;Like, I need to go to the hospital kind of pain. &nbsp;So that is what I ended up doing. &nbsp;I sat in the emergency waiting room as my ear ached. &nbsp;I don't remember how long it took but it was some time before I made it in a room (a first hand experience of just one reason why we need to increase funding to hospitals). &nbsp;There was nothing they could do. &nbsp;They gave me a perscription for some asprin threes, which did little to nothing to help. &nbsp;I had to wait it out. &nbsp;It was a long day after where I could barely sleep. &nbsp;Eventually the pain started to go away in waves and became less and less severe. &nbsp;But even then it still took months before my hearing returned to normal. &nbsp;It was odd showering and hearing the water like it was going through a filter. &nbsp;What I think might of happened was I had a infection that I ended up pushing back with the Qtip into a part of the ear that was smaller and tighter. &nbsp;Which lead to a painful couple of days. &nbsp;So in conclusion, no matter how much you start to panic when you can't hear out of one of your ears, DO NOT stick anything in it. &nbsp;They have that warning on the Qtip box for a reason.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/z9x11ln0r/qtip.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"616\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>So who here has missed an investment or startup stage that they wished that had taken a part it? &nbsp;I'm guessing we are all raising our hands. &nbsp;I'm sure even the smartest people have missed a company they probably wished they had invested their time or money in. &nbsp;You are not alone. &nbsp;Yeah it can leave you with that punch in the gut feeling &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Take A Deep Breath &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FUCK! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Feel better? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yeah there is going to be a period of frustration. &nbsp;Go for a run or hit the gym. &nbsp;Blow it off. &nbsp;But don't dwell on it. &nbsp;There will ALWAYS be another opportunity to capatilze on. &nbsp;That is the secret. But if you waste your time with regret of what could have been you are going to miss out on what is coming next. &nbsp;Keep looking forward and keep looking outward. If you are focused on your field it is easy to feel like another opportunity like the one that passed in your field will not happen again in your lifetime. &nbsp;The key is realizing it may not be in your field. &nbsp;It may be something you have never heard of. &nbsp;Take steemit for example. &nbsp;How many people knew nothing of blockchains but learned about it and spotted an opportunity when the site was new. &nbsp;This carries over to everything. There will always be a next big thing and if you are willing to widen your scope (if only for investment purposes) you will pick up on more of them. &nbsp;It takes a little more work then when it is something that is in your scope of expertise, but taking some time to spot an opportunity while still staying in your field can help you build the capitial you need to continue to pursue your field of choice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You Didn't Actually Lose Anything &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know me telling you this is probably not helping, but it is true. &nbsp;Losing an opportunity is not the same as losing something you actually have. &nbsp;If you knew about the opportunity after the fact, knew about it before and decided not to do anything or didn't know about it at all, the results are all the same. &nbsp;Technically, even if the opportunity never existsed, you are in the same boat then if it did and you didn't act. &nbsp;What is causing any frustration is the knowing that you have missed out, which means, quite literally, that it is all in your head. &nbsp;There are probably dozens of opportunities you are missing a month that are not even on your radar and you don't loss sleep over an of them (and no, don't start thinking about all those other missed opportunities). &nbsp;The loss of what could have been hits as badly as if we actually had it. &nbsp;It is even something you might feel more suddenly than losing something you actually had. &nbsp;That is because we, as forward thinkers, are visualizing what will be and since that is what is in our head, we feel the lose of possibilites quite instantly. &nbsp;While feeling the loss for something you had may take more time as we tend to take for granted what is in our life. &nbsp;&nbsp;So dust yourself off, raise your head and look forward to the next big thing.</p>\n</html>",

DATA MINING FTL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now please don't take this as permission to go through all my data so you can find my favourite band and show me ads of other songs I might like. &nbsp;I kinda like having some semblance of privacy on the net. &nbsp;I don't want ads aimed at me but aimed at the area of interest that the content I am viewing is about. &nbsp;Because you never know what new things, in a field that you are interested in, that you may like. &nbsp;And maybe I will dislike what you are showing me and be annoyed that you are keeping me from the content I am trying to view. &nbsp;Which brings me to my next point. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;IN YOUR FACE! IN YOUR FACE! IN YOUR FACE! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ads can become a problem when they obscure or delay your viewing of the content you want. &nbsp;Even if the ad might be something you are interested in, it does not need to block the content at hand. &nbsp;Personally I don't mind click ads on the side of a website or links that I should check out. &nbsp;It can take away from the design of the site but as long as they do not hinder what I am reading, looking at or watching, then go ahead and tell me, with honesty, what you want me to look at next. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/rgbg3e5cl/ads.jpg\" width=\"294\" height=\"119\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>The hydrosphere is the water part of the Earth\u2019s surface. &nbsp;70% or more of Earth\u2019s surface is actually covered in water. &nbsp;This includes ice at the polar caps, in glaciers, etc. &nbsp;There are 2 main types of bodies of liquid water: fresh water and salt water. &nbsp;The level of salt in salt water can vary considerably. &nbsp;Water can dissolve both solids and gas needed by life. &nbsp;Warm water dissolves solids better than cold, while cold water dissolves gasses better than warm. &nbsp;This is why there are often rich biological environments in cold waters. &nbsp;Most fresh water occurs as smaller inland bodies-like lakes and rivers. &nbsp;While it is the oceans that are salt water, fresh water can also be found underground in reservoirs or aquifers. &nbsp;A large percentage of the liquid water on Earth is in the oceans. &nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at Earth\u2019s oceans we can divide them into the 3 main regions: Neretic Zone, Shallow Zone, and the Abyssal Zone. &nbsp;These zones are divided by water depth. Neretic Zone these are the shallowest regions of the oceans. &nbsp;This includes things like the shore lines, intertidal pools, etc. &nbsp;This makes up only a very small percentage. Shallow Zone: this is defined as the depth to which sunlight can penetrate or roughly 300. &nbsp;Within this zone photosynthesis is possible. Abyssal Zone: these are the depths to which light cannot penetrate. &nbsp;Life in these regions must depend either on organic material that sinks down, or on other energy sources than photosynthesis, generally this would be volcanic activity. Water has a high heat capacity. &nbsp;This means the oceans and other bodies of water can store large amounts of heat. &nbsp;This helps to regulate the temperature of the planet. Both the atmosphere and the hydrosphere are fluids, so they can flow. &nbsp;It is from this motion that we see the weather produced. The motions in the atmosphere and oceans result from 2 warm processes. &nbsp;These are convection and the coriolis force. Convection is the process whereby heat rises. &nbsp;In the atmosphere warm air can evaporate water and rise with it to higher altitudes. &nbsp;This produces clouds. &nbsp;In the oceans currents can arise as warm water rises or cold water sinks. The other force that helps produce both air and water currents is the coriolis force. &nbsp;This force is a result of Earth\u2019s spin. &nbsp;This force causes the atmosphere to circulate in cells where the winds blow at high altitude in particular in constant directions. &nbsp;The air currents can carry either warm or cool air with them. There are also currents in the oceans that are either warm or cold. The combination of water and air and their movement produces weather. &nbsp;One important cycle that comes out of this interaction is what we call the hydrocycle. &nbsp;In this cycle water evaporates, is carried on the wind currents and is dropped elsewhere. &nbsp;This moves water around the globe, but the flow of water can also carry other materials that are necessary for life on Earth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/v30p5xqtn/earth.jpg\" width=\"420\" height=\"407\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>About ten years ago, maybe five, internet dating got saddled with this idea that if you use it there was something wrong with you. &nbsp;That you were socially awkward and had trouble finding a date in real life. &nbsp;But the same things were said when you were a nerd. &nbsp;It wasn't that long ago that nerds were at the bottom of the popularity chart and now it's almost uncool if you are not one. &nbsp;Things and people change. &nbsp;So @funny is announcing that internet dating is no longer something to scoff at. &nbsp;Why do I say this? &nbsp;Well here is a list of reasons why internet dating is a legit, and sometimes better, way to meet new people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You Mean You Have A Personality &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you meet someone at a bar or club what are you really basing your decision on. &nbsp;It's simple, you're basing it on looks and looks alone. &nbsp;I'm not going to argue how important looks are, or are are not, in a relationship but I can tell you, if you don't have anything in common, the relationship is going to suffer. &nbsp;There are cases, and this is rare, when you happen to see a tattoo of something the person likes that you like as well, but even if that is the case, basing a relationship on one common interest isn't a solid plan. &nbsp;And yes, you can argue that internet dating is shallow as well, people with hot pictures are the ones getting more messages. &nbsp;But under that picture is a bio and depending on the site, other information about the person beside how they look in a swimsuit. &nbsp;It may not be a lot but it is something. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Get To Know The Person First &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you flash a smile at a club and the person comes over. &nbsp;You try to make funny banter in their ear but they can't hear a word you're saying. &nbsp;But they think you're cute, so they smile and start to dance with you. &nbsp;Maybe you end up exchanging numbers or a kiss in the corner of the club. &nbsp;That is great, but what did you really learn about the person. &nbsp;I have had times, and yes I am embarrased to admit this, where I wasn't even sure of the woman's name when I called her. &nbsp;Needless to say that relationship didn't work out. &nbsp;But when you meet someone online you have to converse with them. &nbsp;There has to be some kind of back and forth before a meetup is agreed upon. &nbsp;For some people it a quick hey let's meet for coffee and others it may be months of late night conversations, but either way the option to really talk is presented in every case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Less Pressure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's easier, in a way, to be yourself on the net. &nbsp;You can tell people things about yourself that you would have trouble saying in person. &nbsp;There is no fear of what the other person will say or how they will look at you and once you are comfortable that this person likes the real you then you can decide to meet. &nbsp;And there is the added benefit of being able to end the conversation anytime without any awkwardness. &nbsp;It can take months to tell someone things about you that you can spill out online in an conversation and see how they react. &nbsp;And if the getting to know the person doesn't work out, you can send a friendly goodbye message and move on to someone else. &nbsp;No need to have to wait until the date is over as you look at the clock every five minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I Don't Have The Time To Meet People &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That isn't just an excuse. &nbsp;People are busy and dating takes time. &nbsp;Meeting people even takes time. &nbsp;When you go out to a club or bar, you have to get ready, get there and spend, who knows how long, trying to make eye contact, or 'bump into', someone who wants to be 'bumped into' by you. &nbsp;That is if the person even wants to be bothered to chat. &nbsp;There are people who go to clubs because they want to dance or unwind and they don't want to be bothered by some one who is looking for a date. &nbsp;Plus it gets expensive. &nbsp;There are cover charges, costs of transport, drinks. &nbsp;And if you do meet someone you can only get to know them so much in the bar, so that means going on a date, which costs more money. &nbsp;It adds up, especially when you are meeting a lot of people who are not right for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I'm Shy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with being shy. &nbsp;Some people need time before they are comfortable putting themselves out there. &nbsp;Who cares. &nbsp;You are worth it and you want to find someone who knows that. &nbsp;And maybe you are a bit \"weird\" by some people's standards. &nbsp;Again, who cares. &nbsp;Okay techincally this doesn't argue agianst being socially awkward. &nbsp;But if you are, so what, good for you. &nbsp;We all have our quirks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now I know there are negatives. &nbsp;There are people who are not who they say are and times when you meet someone online that you click with over the net but don't seem to gel with when you meet up in person. &nbsp;It is not perfect. &nbsp;And yeah there are benefits to meeting people in person rather than online. But that does not take away from the benefits that online dating has. &nbsp;It is an option, a very viable one, of meeting people and you, if you choose to use it, should not feel lesser for doing so.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/fwffuf12z/date.jpg\" width=\"402\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>I will admit, I was one of those kids who was not a fan of gym. You know the ones. &nbsp;The ones that hope the three outs pass before the ball makes it to the outfield. &nbsp;Come on strike-out! &nbsp;I like to hit the ball, but the whole catching and throwing thing was not for me. &nbsp;I couldn't kick in soccer and apparently you need something called co-ordination for tennis. &nbsp;Basketball required dribbling, so that was out and football was a time to chill on the bench. &nbsp;I never played rugby but I'm sure I would suck at it. &nbsp;Golf is a no unless it is mini. &nbsp;Surfing involves balance and I would sink like a stone at the first wave. &nbsp;Skateboarding lead to ripped pants and scrapped knees. &nbsp;I was not winning an olympic medal when we did our track and field events in school. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hockey, ha! &nbsp;I was happy if I didn't fall on my ass when I was skating. &nbsp;I was not bad at bowling, so that is something. &nbsp;The point is (if there is a point) is if you did suck at sports, you are not alone. &nbsp;I wanted to be on the bench with a pad and a pencil drawing. &nbsp;So if you are or were like me, don't sweat it, find your own ways to stay in shape, eat right and embarce your lack of strength, speed and co-ordination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/g6e73t6o5/baseball.jpg\" width=\"616\" height=\"574\"/></p>\n</html>",

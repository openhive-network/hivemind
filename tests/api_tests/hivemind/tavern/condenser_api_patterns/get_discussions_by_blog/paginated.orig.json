    "body": "<p>In order to solve the problem of the 1%, we have been trying to raise wealth for the middle and lower class. \u00a0This has been done by creating more jobs and raising the minimum wage. \u00a0But maybe that is not the right way to go about it. \u00a0You can increase the wealth as much as you want, but if the cost rises with it, you will be stuck with the same problem. \u00a0However if you decrease the cost of things that people can use to increase their wealth as well the decrease the cost of living, it can lead to a better dispursion of wealth. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Regardless of where you are in the world, odds are that minimum wage needs to be increased. \u00a015 dollars an hour should not be something that may happen in the future. \u00a0It is too difficult for people to live of those wages and even if they do manage to get by, it limits the growth potentional when all their time is spent working dead-end jobs that care not for the growth of their employees. \u00a0But increasing the wages as inflation increases is not enough. \u00a0There is no progress here but only a side-step. \u00a0And worse when it doesn't happen, it makes it harder for people who are struggling. \u00a0There needs to be an influx of cash distrubtion to the lower class if we are to see a fairer system. \u00a0The problem is that money has to come from somwhere and although the wealthy should be giving back, if the people who had money were inclined to give it, they would have done so already (maybe one day). \u00a0There is the government, which can go a long way in helping to spread the wealth better, but we have yet to fix a system where the 1% thrive. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>What if everything that you needed was free? \u00a0Imagine you didn't have to pay for food, or water, housing or electricity. \u00a0Or the internet. \u00a0How about education? \u00a0Think about how much it would free you to work on the field of your choice and actually improve in that field if you are more focused on the work than the money. \u00a0I'm not saying to eliminate wealth, if people want to spend their money on a fancy sports car, that is their choice, but everyone should be able to afford transport. \u00a0If wealth is to stay (which looks like the way it will be as those with wealth will not want to just rid of their wealth) that does not mean you have to penalize those at the bottom. \u00a0Money is a useless frivilous thing and if it is used to buy useless frivilous things is one thing, but when it is needed to eat and warm yourself we have a problem. \u00a0If we can make the world more afforable for everyone it will lead to more opportunites for the lower class while still letting the super-rich keep their wealth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/f3n3jo8uz/Mon.jpg\" /></p>",

    "body": "<p>It was on New Years Eve. \u00a0I was spending the night with a friend, nothing too exciting, when out of the blue I could not hear out of my left ear. \u00a0I mean nothing. \u00a0So being a bit of a worrier, I wanted to fix it ASAP. \u00a0I went to the washroom and grabbed a Qtip. \u00a0I figured it was just a little clogged, I would clean it out and that would be that. \u00a0But the Qtip did nothing. \u00a0So I went back to what I was doing. \u00a0It was only a clog, it would clear itself out eventually. \u00a0But then the pain started. \u00a0Not a gentle irritation but a painful throbbing. \u00a0Like, I need to go to the hospital kind of pain. \u00a0So that is what I ended up doing. \u00a0I sat in the emergency waiting room as my ear ached. \u00a0I don't remember how long it took but it was some time before I made it in a room (a first hand experience of just one reason why we need to increase funding to hospitals). \u00a0There was nothing they could do. \u00a0They gave me a perscription for some asprin threes, which did little to nothing to help. \u00a0I had to wait it out. \u00a0It was a long day after where I could barely sleep. \u00a0Eventually the pain started to go away in waves and became less and less severe. \u00a0But even then it still took months before my hearing returned to normal. \u00a0It was odd showering and hearing the water like it was going through a filter. \u00a0What I think might of happened was I had a infection that I ended up pushing back with the Qtip into a part of the ear that was smaller and tighter. \u00a0Which lead to a painful couple of days. \u00a0So in conclusion, no matter how much you start to panic when you can't hear out of one of your ears, DO NOT stick anything in it. \u00a0They have that warning on the Qtip box for a reason.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/pohfcxls5/qtip.jpg\" /></p>",

    "body": "<p>I will admit, I was one of those kids who was not a fan of gym. You know the ones. \u00a0The ones that hope the three outs pass before the ball makes it to the outfield. \u00a0Come on strike-out! \u00a0I like to hit the ball, but the whole catching and throwing thing was not for me. \u00a0I couldn't kick in soccer and apparently you need something called co-ordination for tennis. \u00a0Basketball required dribbling, so that was out and football was a time to chill on the bench. \u00a0I never played rugby but I'm sure I would suck at it. \u00a0Golf is a no unless it is mini. \u00a0Surfing involves balance and I would sink like a stone at the first wave. \u00a0Skateboarding lead to ripped pants and scrapped knees. \u00a0I was not winning an olympic medal when we did our track and field events in school. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hockey, ha! \u00a0I was happy if I didn't fall on my ass when I was skating. \u00a0I was not bad at bowling, so that is something. \u00a0The point is (if there is a point) is if you did suck at sports, you are not alone. \u00a0I wanted to be on the bench with a pad and a pencil drawing. \u00a0So if you are or were like me, don't sweat it, find your own ways to stay in shape, eat right and embarce your lack of strength, speed and co-ordination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/z4vpfnm91/baseball.jpg\" /></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>It was on New Years Eve. &nbsp;I was spending the night with a friend, nothing too exciting, when out of the blue I could not hear out of my left ear. &nbsp;I mean nothing. &nbsp;So being a bit of a worrier, I wanted to fix it ASAP. &nbsp;I went to the washroom and grabbed a Qtip. &nbsp;I figured it was just a little clogged, I would clean it out and that would be that. &nbsp;But the Qtip did nothing. &nbsp;So I went back to what I was doing. &nbsp;It was only a clog, it would clear itself out eventually. &nbsp;But then the pain started. &nbsp;Not a gentle irritation but a painful throbbing. &nbsp;Like, I need to go to the hospital kind of pain. &nbsp;So that is what I ended up doing. &nbsp;I sat in the emergency waiting room as my ear ached. &nbsp;I don't remember how long it took but it was some time before I made it in a room (a first hand experience of just one reason why we need to increase funding to hospitals). &nbsp;There was nothing they could do. &nbsp;They gave me a perscription for some asprin threes, which did little to nothing to help. &nbsp;I had to wait it out. &nbsp;It was a long day after where I could barely sleep. &nbsp;Eventually the pain started to go away in waves and became less and less severe. &nbsp;But even then it still took months before my hearing returned to normal. &nbsp;It was odd showering and hearing the water like it was going through a filter. &nbsp;What I think might of happened was I had a infection that I ended up pushing back with the Qtip into a part of the ear that was smaller and tighter. &nbsp;Which lead to a painful couple of days. &nbsp;So in conclusion, no matter how much you start to panic when you can't hear out of one of your ears, DO NOT stick anything in it. &nbsp;They have that warning on the Qtip box for a reason.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/z9x11ln0r/qtip.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"616\"/></p>\n</html>",

But if you waste your time with regret of what could have been you are going to miss out on what is coming next. &nbsp;Keep looking forward and keep looking outward. If you are focused on your field it is easy to feel like another opportunity like the one that passed in your field will not happen again in your lifetime. &nbsp;The key is realizing it may not be in your field. &nbsp;It may be something you have never heard of. &nbsp;Take steemit for example. &nbsp;How many people knew nothing of blockchains but learned about it and spotted an opportunity when the site was new. &nbsp;This carries over to everything. There will always be a next big thing and if you are willing to widen your scope (if only for investment purposes) you will pick up on more of them. &nbsp;It takes a little more work then when it is something that is in your scope of expertise, but taking some time to spot an opportunity while still staying in your field can help you build the capitial you need to continue to pursue your field of choice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You Didn't Actually Lose Anything &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know me telling you this is probably not helping, but it is true. &nbsp;Losing an opportunity is not the same as losing something you actually have. &nbsp;If you knew about the opportunity after the fact, knew about it before and decided not to do anything or didn't know about it at all, the results are all the same. &nbsp;Technically, even if the opportunity never existsed, you are in the same boat then if it did and you didn't act. &nbsp;What is causing any frustration is the knowing that you have missed out, which means, quite literally, that it is all in your head. &nbsp;There are probably dozens of opportunities you are missing a month that are not even on your radar and you don't loss sleep over an of them (and no, don't start thinking about all those other missed opportunities). &nbsp;The loss of what could have been hits as badly as if we actually had it. &nbsp;It is even something you might feel more suddenly than losing something you actually had. &nbsp;That is because we, as forward thinkers, are visualizing what will be and since that is what is in our head, we feel the lose of possibilites quite instantly. &nbsp;While feeling the loss for something you had may take more time as we tend to take for granted what is in our life. &nbsp;&nbsp;So dust yourself off, raise your head and look forward to the next big thing.</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>The hydrosphere is the water part of the Earth\u2019s surface. &nbsp;70% or more of Earth\u2019s surface is actually covered in water. &nbsp;This includes ice at the polar caps, in glaciers, etc. &nbsp;There are 2 main types of bodies of liquid water: fresh water and salt water. &nbsp;The level of salt in salt water can vary considerably. &nbsp;Water can dissolve both solids and gas needed by life. &nbsp;Warm water dissolves solids better than cold, while cold water dissolves gasses better than warm. &nbsp;This is why there are often rich biological environments in cold waters. &nbsp;Most fresh water occurs as smaller inland bodies-like lakes and rivers. &nbsp;While it is the oceans that are salt water, fresh water can also be found underground in reservoirs or aquifers. &nbsp;A large percentage of the liquid water on Earth is in the oceans. &nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at Earth\u2019s oceans we can divide them into the 3 main regions: Neretic Zone, Shallow Zone, and the Abyssal Zone. &nbsp;These zones are divided by water depth. Neretic Zone these are the shallowest regions of the oceans. &nbsp;This includes things like the shore lines, intertidal pools, etc. &nbsp;This makes up only a very small percentage. Shallow Zone: this is defined as the depth to which sunlight can penetrate or roughly 300. &nbsp;Within this zone photosynthesis is possible. Abyssal Zone: these are the depths to which light cannot penetrate. &nbsp;Life in these regions must depend either on organic material that sinks down, or on other energy sources than photosynthesis, generally this would be volcanic activity. Water has a high heat capacity. &nbsp;This means the oceans and other bodies of water can store large amounts of heat. &nbsp;This helps to regulate the temperature of the planet. Both the atmosphere and the hydrosphere are fluids, so they can flow. &nbsp;It is from this motion that we see the weather produced. The motions in the atmosphere and oceans result from 2 warm processes. &nbsp;These are convection and the coriolis force. Convection is the process whereby heat rises. &nbsp;In the atmosphere warm air can evaporate water and rise with it to higher altitudes. &nbsp;This produces clouds. &nbsp;In the oceans currents can arise as warm water rises or cold water sinks. The other force that helps produce both air and water currents is the coriolis force. &nbsp;This force is a result of Earth\u2019s spin. &nbsp;This force causes the atmosphere to circulate in cells where the winds blow at high altitude in particular in constant directions. &nbsp;The air currents can carry either warm or cool air with them. There are also currents in the oceans that are either warm or cold. The combination of water and air and their movement produces weather. &nbsp;One important cycle that comes out of this interaction is what we call the hydrocycle. &nbsp;In this cycle water evaporates, is carried on the wind currents and is dropped elsewhere. &nbsp;This moves water around the globe, but the flow of water can also carry other materials that are necessary for life on Earth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/v30p5xqtn/earth.jpg\" width=\"420\" height=\"407\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>About ten years ago, maybe five, internet dating got saddled with this idea that if you use it there was something wrong with you. &nbsp;That you were socially awkward and had trouble finding a date in real life. &nbsp;But the same things were said when you were a nerd. &nbsp;It wasn't that long ago that nerds were at the bottom of the popularity chart and now it's almost uncool if you are not one. &nbsp;Things and people change. &nbsp;So @funny is announcing that internet dating is no longer something to scoff at. &nbsp;Why do I say this? &nbsp;Well here is a list of reasons why internet dating is a legit, and sometimes better, way to meet new people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You Mean You Have A Personality &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you meet someone at a bar or club what are you really basing your decision on. &nbsp;It's simple, you're basing it on looks and looks alone. &nbsp;I'm not going to argue how important looks are, or are are not, in a relationship but I can tell you, if you don't have anything in common, the relationship is going to suffer. &nbsp;There are cases, and this is rare, when you happen to see a tattoo of something the person likes that you like as well, but even if that is the case, basing a relationship on one common interest isn't a solid plan. &nbsp;And yes, you can argue that internet dating is shallow as well, people with hot pictures are the ones getting more messages. &nbsp;But under that picture is a bio and depending on the site, other information about the person beside how they look in a swimsuit. &nbsp;It may not be a lot but it is something. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Get To Know The Person First &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you flash a smile at a club and the person comes over. &nbsp;You try to make funny banter in their ear but they can't hear a word you're saying. &nbsp;But they think you're cute, so they smile and start to dance with you. &nbsp;Maybe you end up exchanging numbers or a kiss in the corner of the club. &nbsp;That is great, but what did you really learn about the person. &nbsp;I have had times, and yes I am embarrased to admit this, where I wasn't even sure of the woman's name when I called her. &nbsp;Needless to say that relationship didn't work out. &nbsp;But when you meet someone online you have to converse with them. &nbsp;There has to be some kind of back and forth before a meetup is agreed upon. &nbsp;For some people it a quick hey let's meet for coffee and others it may be months of late night conversations, but either way the option to really talk is presented in every case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Less Pressure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's easier, in a way, to be yourself on the net. &nbsp;You can tell people things about yourself that you would have trouble saying in person. &nbsp;There is no fear of what the other person will say or how they will look at you and once you are comfortable that this person likes the real you then you can decide to meet. &nbsp;And there is the added benefit of being able to end the conversation anytime without any awkwardness. &nbsp;It can take months to tell someone things about you that you can spill out online in an conversation and see how they react. &nbsp;And if the getting to know the person doesn't work out, you can send a friendly goodbye message and move on to someone else. &nbsp;No need to have to wait until the date is over as you look at the clock every five minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I Don't Have The Time To Meet People &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That isn't just an excuse. &nbsp;People are busy and dating takes time. &nbsp;Meeting people even takes time. &nbsp;When you go out to a club or bar, you have to get ready, get there and spend, who knows how long, trying to make eye contact, or 'bump into', someone who wants to be 'bumped into' by you. &nbsp;That is if the person even wants to be bothered to chat. &nbsp;There are people who go to clubs because they want to dance or unwind and they don't want to be bothered by some one who is looking for a date. &nbsp;Plus it gets expensive. &nbsp;There are cover charges, costs of transport, drinks. &nbsp;And if you do meet someone you can only get to know them so much in the bar, so that means going on a date, which costs more money. &nbsp;It adds up, especially when you are meeting a lot of people who are not right for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I'm Shy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with being shy. &nbsp;Some people need time before they are comfortable putting themselves out there. &nbsp;Who cares. &nbsp;You are worth it and you want to find someone who knows that. &nbsp;And maybe you are a bit \"weird\" by some people's standards. &nbsp;Again, who cares. &nbsp;Okay techincally this doesn't argue agianst being socially awkward. &nbsp;But if you are, so what, good for you. &nbsp;We all have our quirks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now I know there are negatives. &nbsp;There are people who are not who they say are and times when you meet someone online that you click with over the net but don't seem to gel with when you meet up in person. &nbsp;It is not perfect. &nbsp;And yeah there are benefits to meeting people in person rather than online. But that does not take away from the benefits that online dating has. &nbsp;It is an option, a very viable one, of meeting people and you, if you choose to use it, should not feel lesser for doing so.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/fwffuf12z/date.jpg\" width=\"402\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>I will admit, I was one of those kids who was not a fan of gym. You know the ones. &nbsp;The ones that hope the three outs pass before the ball makes it to the outfield. &nbsp;Come on strike-out! &nbsp;I like to hit the ball, but the whole catching and throwing thing was not for me. &nbsp;I couldn't kick in soccer and apparently you need something called co-ordination for tennis. &nbsp;Basketball required dribbling, so that was out and football was a time to chill on the bench. &nbsp;I never played rugby but I'm sure I would suck at it. &nbsp;Golf is a no unless it is mini. &nbsp;Surfing involves balance and I would sink like a stone at the first wave. &nbsp;Skateboarding lead to ripped pants and scrapped knees. &nbsp;I was not winning an olympic medal when we did our track and field events in school. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hockey, ha! &nbsp;I was happy if I didn't fall on my ass when I was skating. &nbsp;I was not bad at bowling, so that is something. &nbsp;The point is (if there is a point) is if you did suck at sports, you are not alone. &nbsp;I wanted to be on the bench with a pad and a pencil drawing. &nbsp;So if you are or were like me, don't sweat it, find your own ways to stay in shape, eat right and embarce your lack of strength, speed and co-ordination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/g6e73t6o5/baseball.jpg\" width=\"616\" height=\"574\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>About ten years ago, maybe five, internet dating got saddled with this idea that if you use it there was something wrong with you. &nbsp;That you were socially awkward and had trouble finding a date in real life. &nbsp;But the same things were said when you were a nerd. &nbsp;It wasn't that long ago that nerds were at the bottom of the popularity chart and now it's almost uncool now if you are not one. &nbsp;Things and people change. &nbsp;So @funny is announcing that internet dating is not for losers. &nbsp;Why do I say this? &nbsp;Well here is a list of reasons why internet dating is a legit, and sometimes better, way to meet new people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You Mean You Have A Personality &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you meet someone at a bar or club what are you really basing your decision on. &nbsp;It's simple, you're basing it on looks and looks alone. &nbsp;I'm not going to argue how important looks are or are not in a relationship but I can tell you, if you don't have anything in common, the relationship is going to suffer. &nbsp;There are cases, and this is rare, when you happen to see a tattoo of something the person likes that you like as well, but even if that is the case, basing a relationship on one common interest isn't a solid plan. &nbsp;And yes, you can argue that internet dating is shallow as well, people with hot pictures are the ones getting more messages. &nbsp;But under that picture is a bio and depending on the site, other information about the person beside how they look in a swimsuit. &nbsp;It may not be a lot but it is something. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Get To Know The Person First &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you flash a smile at a club and the person comes over. &nbsp;You try to make funny banter in their ear but they can't hear a word you're saying. &nbsp;But they think you're cute, so they smile and start to dance with you. &nbsp;Maybe you end up exchanging numbers or a kiss in the corner of the club. &nbsp;That is great, but what did you really learn about the person? &nbsp;I have had times, and yes I am embarrased to admit this, where I wasn't even sure of the woman's name when I called her. &nbsp;Needless to say that relationship didn't work out. &nbsp;But when you meet someone online you have to converse with them. &nbsp;There has to be some kind of back and forth before a meetup is agreed upon. &nbsp;For some people it a quick hey let's meet for coffee and others it may be months of late night conversations, but either way the option to really talk is presented in every case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Less Pressure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's easier, in a way, to be yourself on the net. &nbsp;You can tell people things about yourself that you would have trouble saying in person. &nbsp;There is no fear of what the other person will say or how they will look at you and once you are comfortable that this person likes the real you then you can decide to meet. &nbsp;And there is the added benefit of being able to end the conversation anytime without any awkwardness. &nbsp;It can take months to tell someone things about you that you can spill out online in an conversation and see how they react. &nbsp;And if the getting to know the person doesn't work out, you can send a friendly goodbye message and move on to someone else. &nbsp;No need to have to wait until the date is over as you look at the clock every five minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I Don't Have The Time To Meet People &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That isn't jsut an excuse. &nbsp;People are busy and dating takes time. &nbsp;Meeting people even takes time. &nbsp;When you go out to a club or bar, you have to get ready, get there and spend, who knows how long, trying to make eye contact, or 'bump into', someone who wants to be 'bumped into' by you. &nbsp;That is if the person even wants to be bothered to chat. &nbsp;There are people who go to clubs because they want to dance or unwind and they don't want to be bothered by some one who is looking for a date. &nbsp;Plus it gets expensive. &nbsp;There are cover charges, costs of transport and drinks. &nbsp;And if you do meet someone you can only get to know so much about them in the bar, so that means going on a date, which costs more money. &nbsp;It adds up, especially when you are meeting a lot of people who are not right for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm Shy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with being shy. &nbsp;Some people need time before they are comfortable putting themselves out there. &nbsp;Who cares. &nbsp;You are worth it and you want to find someone who knows that. &nbsp;And maybe you are a bit \"weird\" by some people's standards. &nbsp;Again, who cares. &nbsp;Okay techincally this doesn't argue agianst being socially awkward. &nbsp;But if you are, so what, good for you. &nbsp;We all have our quirks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now I know there are negatives. &nbsp;There are people who are not who they say are and times when you meet someone online that you click with over the net but don't seem to gel with when you meet up in person. &nbsp;It is not perfect. &nbsp;And yeah there are benefits to meeting people in person rather than online. But that does not take away from the benefits that online dating has. &nbsp;It is an option, a very viable one, of meeting people and you, if you choose to use it, should not feel lesser for doing so.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/gj21ohlx7/date.jpg\" width=\"402\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Before I start I want to say depending on how blockchains work and networks like steemit, this article may become obsolete. &nbsp;But for now ads are not going anywhere anytime soon, so let's discuss ways of making them less annoying. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>BUT ALL THE COOL KIDS ARE DOING IT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The world we live in now is one of transparency. &nbsp;Everyone understands, in some extent, how advertising works. &nbsp;We are not stupid. &nbsp;We know you want us to buy your drink, wear your shoes and see your movies. &nbsp;&nbsp;You want us to see cool people using your product and have us see enough of it that it appears in our dreams. &nbsp;But we don't need to be tricked. &nbsp;And we don't want to be lied to. &nbsp;You don't need to \"sell\" us anything. &nbsp;If you present people with something they might want to try or buy, they might actually be happy to click on the ad or watch the commerical. &nbsp;The process should not be one of selling but informing, and letting people decide for themselves. &nbsp;But in order to do this the advertisement needs to match the content where the ad is being placed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IT COMES DOWN TO THE WHERE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Look at movie theatre previews. &nbsp;Everybody loves them. &nbsp;A lot of people even make sure they show up early so they don't miss them. &nbsp;Technically those previews as just ads. &nbsp;Ads for other movies you might want to see. &nbsp;But why do people enjoy them? &nbsp;Because the odds are that the people who are at the movies are people who like to go to the movies. &nbsp;This is an audience who is interested in what is coming up next. &nbsp;However when you start to play commercials for other prodcuts before a film, it may lower the chances of a captivated audience. &nbsp;It is the same regardless of media and topic. &nbsp;If you are watching a golf tournament, previews about other golf events might be of interest. &nbsp;But a commercial for a new clothing line has a higher chance of being a miss. &nbsp;Same for ads on websites, I have seen ads on social media that I would never click on, ads for products that I would have no use for. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A.I. DATA MINING FTL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now please don't take this as permission to go through all my data so you can find my favourite band and show me ads of other songs I might like. &nbsp;I kinda like having some semblance of privacy on the net. &nbsp;I don't want ads aimed at me but aimed at the area of interest that the content I am viewing is about. &nbsp;Because you never know what new things, in a field that you are interested in, that you may like. &nbsp;And maybe I will dislike what you are showing me and be annoyed that you are keeping me from the content I am trying to view. &nbsp;Which brings me to my next point. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IN YOUR FACE! IN YOUR FACE! IN YOUR FACE! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ads can become a problem when they obscure or delay your viewing of the content you want. &nbsp;Even if the ad might be something you are interested in, it does not need to block the content at hand. &nbsp;Personally I don't mind click ads on the side of a website or links that I should check out. &nbsp;It can take away from the aesthetics of the site but as long as they do not hinder what I am reading, looking at or watching, then go ahead and tell me, with honesty, what you want me to look at next. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That is just my two cents. &nbsp;How do you feel about ads?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/lguwmyhh1/ads.jpg\" width=\"294\" height=\"119\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>About ten years ago, maybe five, internet dating got saddled with this idea that if you use it there was something wrong with you. &nbsp;That you were socially awkward and had trouble finding a date in real life. &nbsp;But the same things were said when you were a nerd. &nbsp;It wasn't that long ago that nerds were at the bottom of the popularity chart and now it's almost uncool if you are not one. &nbsp;Things and people change. &nbsp;So @funny is announcing that internet dating is not for losers. &nbsp;Why do I say this? &nbsp;Well here is a list of reasons why internet dating is a legit, and sometimes better, way to meet new people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You Mean You Have A Personality </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you meet someone at a bar or club what are you really basing your decision on. &nbsp;It's simple, you're basing it on looks and looks alone. &nbsp;I'm not going to argue how important looks are, or are are not, in a relationship but I can tell you, if you don't have anything in common, the relationship is going to suffer. &nbsp;There are cases, and this is rare, when you happen to see a tattoo of something the person likes that you like as well, but even if that is the case, basing a relationship on one common interest isn't a solid plan. &nbsp;And yes, you can argue that internet dating is shallow as well, people with hot pictures are the ones getting more messages. &nbsp;But under that picture is a bio and depending on the site, other information about the person beside how they look in a swimsuit. &nbsp;It may not be a lot but it is something. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Get To Know The Person First </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you flash a smile at a club and the person comes over. &nbsp;You try to make funny banter in their ear but they can't hear a word you're saying. &nbsp;But they think you're cute, so they smile and start to dance with you. &nbsp;Maybe you end up exchanging numbers or a kiss in the corner of the club. &nbsp;That is great, but what did you really learn about the person. &nbsp;I have had times, and yes I am embarrased to admit this, where I wasn't even sure of the woman's name when I called her. &nbsp;It was loud, I didn't hear, not for my fault. &nbsp;Needless to say that relationship didn't work out. &nbsp;But when you meet someone online you have to converse with them. &nbsp;There has to be some kind of back and forth before a meetup is agreed upon. &nbsp;For some people it a quick hey let's meet for coffee and others it may be months of late night conversations, but either way the option to really talk is presented in every case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Less Pressure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's easier, in a way, to be yourself on the net. &nbsp;You can tell people things about yourself that you would have trouble saying in person. &nbsp;There is no fear of what the other person will say or how they will look at you and once you are comfortable that this person likes the real you then you can decide to meet. &nbsp;And there is the added benefit of being able to end the conversation anytime without any awkwardness. &nbsp;It can take months to tell someone things about you that you can spill out online in an conversation and see how they react. &nbsp;And if the getting to know the person doesn't work out, you can send a friendly goodbye message and move on to someone else. &nbsp;No need to have to wait until the date is over as you look at the clock every five minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I Don't Have The Time To Meet People &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That isn't jsut an excuse. &nbsp;People are busy and dating takes time. &nbsp;Meeting people even takes time. &nbsp;When you go out to a club or bar, you have to get ready, get there and spend, who knows how long, trying to make eye contact, or 'bump into', someone who wants to be 'bumped into' by you. &nbsp;That is if the person even wants to be bothered to chat. &nbsp;There are people who go to clubs because they want to dance or unwind and they don't want to be bothered by some one who is looking for a date. &nbsp;Plus it gets expensive. &nbsp;There are cover charges, costs of transport, drinks. &nbsp;And if you do meet someone you can only get to know them so much in the bar, so that means going on a date, which costs more money. &nbsp;It adds up, especially when you are meeting a lot of people who are not right for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I'm Shy &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with being shy. &nbsp;Some people need time before they are comfortable putting themselves out there. &nbsp;Who cares. &nbsp;You are worth it and you want to find someone who knows that. &nbsp;And maybe you are a bit \"weird\" by some people's standards. &nbsp;Again, who cares. &nbsp;Okay techincally this doesn't argue agianst being social awkward. &nbsp;But if you are, so what, good for you. &nbsp;We all have our quirks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now I know there are negatives. &nbsp;There are people who are not who they say are and times when you meet someone online that you click with over the net but don't seem to gel with when you meet up in person. &nbsp;It is not perfect. &nbsp;And yeah there are benefits to meeting people in person rather than online. But that does not take away from the benefits that online dating has. &nbsp;It is an option, a very viable one, of meeting people and you, if you choose to use it, should not feel lesser for doing so.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/epirwfkz9/date.jpg\" width=\"536\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>The hydrosphere is the water part of the Earth\u2019s surface. &nbsp;70% or more of Earth\u2019s surface is actually covered in water. &nbsp;This includes ice at the polar caps, in glaciers, etc. &nbsp;There are 2 main types of bodies of liquid water: fresh water and salt water. &nbsp;The level of salt in salt water can vary considerably. &nbsp;Water can dissolve both solids and gas needed by life. &nbsp;Warm water dissolves solids better than cold, while cold water dissolves gasses better than warm. &nbsp;This is why there are often rich biological environments in cold waters. &nbsp;Most fresh water occurs as smaller inland bodies-like lakes and rivers. &nbsp;While it is the oceans that are salt water, fresh water can also be found underground in reservoirs or aquifers. &nbsp;A large percentage of the liquid water on Earth is in the oceans. &nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at Earth\u2019s oceans we can divide them into the 3 main regions: Neretic Zone, Shallow Zone, and the Abyssal Zone. &nbsp;These zones are divided by water depth. Neretic Zone these are the shallowest regions of the oceans. &nbsp;This includes things like the shore lines, intertidal pools, etc. &nbsp;This makes up only a very small percentage. Shallow Zone: this is defined as the depth to which sunlight can penetrate or roughly 300. &nbsp;Within this zone photosynthesis is possible. Abyssal Zone: these are the depths to which light cannot penetrate. &nbsp;Life in these regions must depend either on organic material that sinks down, or on other energy sources than photosynthesis, generally this would be volcanic activity. Water has a high heat capacity. &nbsp;This means the oceans and other bodies of water can store large amounts of heat. &nbsp;This helps to regulate the temperature of the planet. Both the atmosphere and the hydrosphere are fluids, so they can flow. &nbsp;It is from this motion that we see the weather produced. The motions in the atmosphere and oceans result from 2 warm processes. &nbsp;These are convection and the coriolis force. Convection is the process whereby heat rises. &nbsp;In the atmosphere warm air can evaporate water and rise with it to higher altitudes. &nbsp;This produces clouds. &nbsp;In the oceans currents can arise as warm water rises or cold water sinks. The other force that helps produce both air and water currents is the coriolis force. &nbsp;This force is a result of Earth\u2019s spin. &nbsp;This force causes the atmosphere to circulate in cells where the winds blow at high altitude in particular in constant directions. &nbsp;The air currents can carry either warm or cool air with them. There are also currents in the oceans that are either warm or cold. The combination of water and air and their movement produces weather. &nbsp;One important cycle that comes out of this interaction is what we call the hydrocycle. &nbsp;In this cycle water evaporates, is carried on the wind currents and is dropped elsewhere. &nbsp;This moves water around the globe, but the flow of water can also carry other materials that are necessary for life on Earth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/6k2hgvxt1/earth.jpg\" width=\"420\" height=\"407\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Hey steemites,</p>\n<p>Throwing some science at you, this is from my university days.</p>\n<h1>HYDROPLANES</h1>\n<p>The hydrosphere is the water part of the Earth\u2019s surface. &nbsp;70% or more of Earth\u2019s surface is actually covered in water. &nbsp;This includes ice at the polar caps, in glaciers, etc. &nbsp;There are 2 main types of bodies of liquid water: fresh water and salt water. &nbsp;The level of salt in salt water can vary considerably. &nbsp;Water can dissolve both solids and gas needed by life. &nbsp;Warm water dissolves solids better than cold, while cold water dissolves gasses better than warm. &nbsp;This is why there are often rich biological environments in cold waters. &nbsp;Most fresh water occurs as smaller inland bodies-like lakes and rivers. &nbsp;While it is the oceans that are salt water, fresh water can also be found underground in reservoirs or aquifers. &nbsp;A large percentage of the liquid water on Earth is in the oceans. &nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at Earth\u2019s oceans we can divide them into the 3 main regions: Neretic Zone, Shallow Zone, and the Abyssal Zone. &nbsp;These zones are divided by water depth. Neretic Zone these are the shallowest regions of the oceans. &nbsp;This includes things like the shore lines, intertidal pools, etc. &nbsp;This makes up only a very small percentage. Shallow Zone: this is defined as the depth to which sunlight can penetrate or roughly 300. &nbsp;Within this zone photosynthesis is possible. &nbsp;Abyssal Zone: these are the depths to which light cannot penetrate. &nbsp;Life in these regions must depend either on organic material that sinks down, or on other energy sources than photosynthesis, generally this would be volcanic activity. Water has a high heat capacity. &nbsp;This means the oceans and other bodies of water can store large amounts of heat. &nbsp;This helps to regulate the temperature of the planet. Both the atmosphere and the hydrosphere are fluids, so they can flow. &nbsp;It is from this motion that we see the weather produced. The motions in the atmosphere and oceans result from 2 warm processes. &nbsp;These are convection and the coriolis force. Convection is the process whereby heat rises. &nbsp;In the atmosphere warm air can evaporate water and rise with it to higher altitudes. &nbsp;This produces clouds. &nbsp;In the oceans currents can arise as warm water rises or cold water sinks. The other force that helps produce both air and water currents is the coriolis force. &nbsp;This force is a result of Earth\u2019s spin. &nbsp;This force causes the atmosphere to circulate in cells where the winds blow at high altitude in particular in constant directions. &nbsp;The air currents can carry either warm or cool air with them. There are also currents in the oceans that are either warm or cold. The combination of water and air and their movement produces weather. &nbsp;One important cycle that comes out of this interaction is what we call the hydrocycle. &nbsp;In this cycle water evaporates, is carried on the wind currents and is dropped elsewhere. &nbsp;This moves water around the globe, but the flow of water can also carry other materials that are necessary for life on Earth.</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>So who here has missed an investment or startup stage that they wished that had taken a part it? &nbsp;I'm guessing we are all raising our hands. &nbsp;I'm sure even the smartest people have missed a company they probably wished they had invested their time or money in. &nbsp;You are not alone. &nbsp;Yeah it can leave you with that punch in the gut feeling &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Take A Deep Breath &nbsp;</p>\n<p>FUCK! &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Feel better?</p>\n<p>Yeah there is going to be a period of frustration. &nbsp;Go for a run or hit the gym. &nbsp;Blow it off. &nbsp;But don't dwell on it. &nbsp;There will ALWAYS be another opportunity to capatilze on. &nbsp;That is the secret. But if you waste your time with regret of what could have been you are going to miss out on what is coming next. &nbsp;Keep looking forward and keep looking outward. If you are focused on your field it is easy to feel like another opportunity like the one that passed in your field will not happen again in your lifetime. &nbsp;The key is realizing it may not be in your field. &nbsp;It may be something you have never heard of. &nbsp;Take steemit for example. &nbsp;How many people knew nothing of blockchains but learned about it and spotted an opportunity when the site was new. &nbsp;This carries over to everything. There will always be a next big thing and if you are willing to widen your scope (if only for investment purposes) you will pick up on more of them. &nbsp;It takes a little more work then when it is something that is in your scope of expertise, but taking some time to spot an opportunity while still staying in your field can help you build the capitial you need to continue to pursue your field of choice. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>You Didn't Actually Lose Anything &nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>I know me telling you this is probably not helping, but it is true. &nbsp;Losing an opportunity is not the same as losing something you actually have. &nbsp;If you knew about the opportunity after the fact, knew about it before and decided not to do anything or didn't know about it at all, the results are all the same. &nbsp;Technically, even if the opportunity never existsed, you are in the same boat then if it did and you didn't act. &nbsp;What is causing any frustration is the knowing that you have missed out, which means, quite literally, that it is all in your head. &nbsp;There are probably dozens of opportunities you are missing a month that are not even on your radar and you don't loss sleep over an of them (and no, don't start thinking about all those other missed opportunities). &nbsp;The loss of what could have been hits as badly as if we actually had it. &nbsp;It is even something you might feel more suddenly than losing something you actually had. &nbsp;That is because we, as forward thinkers, are visualizing what will be and since that is what is in our head, we feel the lose of possibilites quite instantly. &nbsp;While feeling the loss for something you had may take more time as we tend to take for granted what is in our life.</p>\n<p>So dust yourself off, raise your head and look forward to the next big thing.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>It was on New Years Eve. &nbsp;I was spending the night with a friend, nothing too exciting when out of the blue I could not hear out of my left ear. &nbsp;I mean nothing. &nbsp;So being a bit of a worrier, I wanted to fix it ASAP. &nbsp;I went to the washroom and grabbed a Qtip. &nbsp;I figured it was just a little clogged, I would clean it out and that would be that. &nbsp;But the Qtip did nothing. &nbsp;So I went back to what I was doing. &nbsp;It was only a clog, it would clear itself eventually. &nbsp;But then the pain started. &nbsp;Not a gentle irritation but a painful throbbing. &nbsp;Like, I need to go to the hospital kind of pain. &nbsp;So that is what I ended up doing. &nbsp;I sat in the emergy waiting room as my ear ached. &nbsp;I don't remember how long it took but it was some time before I made it in a room (a first hand experience of just one reason why we need to fund hospitals). &nbsp;There was nothing they could do. &nbsp;They gave me a perscription for some asprin threes, which did nothing as did the medicine for the ear. &nbsp;I had to wait it out. &nbsp;It was a long day after where I could barely sleep. &nbsp;Eventually the pain started to go away in waves and become less and less severe. &nbsp;But even then it still took months before my hearing returned to normal. &nbsp;It was odd showering and hearing the water like it was going through a filter. &nbsp;What I think happened was I had a infection that I ended up pushing back with the Qtip into a part of the ear that was smaller and tighter. &nbsp;Which lead to a painful couple of days. &nbsp;So in conclusion, no matter how much you start to panic when you can't hear out of one of your ears, DO NOT stick anything in it. &nbsp;They have that warning on the Qtip box for a reason.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/90bb7eeq3/lifelogo.jpg\" width=\"578\" height=\"261\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Before I start I want to say depending on how blockchains work and networks like steemit, this article may become obsolete. &nbsp;But for now ads are not going anywhere anytime soon, so let's discuss ways of making them less annoying. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>BUT ALL THE COOL KIDS ARE DOING IT &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>The world we live in now is one of transparency. &nbsp;Everyone understands, in some extent, how advertising works. &nbsp;We are not stupid. &nbsp;We know you want us to buy your drink, wear your shoes and see your movies. &nbsp;&nbsp;You want us to see cool people using your product and have us see enough of it that it appears in our dreams. &nbsp;But we don't need to be tricked. &nbsp;And we don't want to be lied to. &nbsp;You don't need to \"sell\" us anything. &nbsp;If you present people with something they might want to try or buy, they might actually be happy to click on the ad or watch the commerical. &nbsp;The process should not be one of selling but informing, and letting people decide for themselves. &nbsp;But in order to do this the advertisement needs to match the content where the ad is being placed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IT COMES DOWN TO THE WHERE &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Look at movie theatre previews. &nbsp;Everybody loves them. &nbsp;A lot of people even make sure they show up early so they don't miss them. &nbsp;Technically those previews as just ads. &nbsp;Ads for other movies you might want to see. &nbsp;But why do people enjoy them? &nbsp;Because the odds are that the people who are at the movies are people who like to go to the movies. &nbsp;This is an audience who is interested in what is coming up next. &nbsp;However when you start to play commercials for other prodcuts before a film, it may lower the chances of a captivated audience. &nbsp;It is the same regardless of media and topic. &nbsp;If you are watching a golf tournament, previews about other golf events might be of interest. &nbsp;But a commercial for a new clothing line has a higher chance of being a miss. &nbsp;Same for ads on websites, I have seen ads on social media that I would never click on, ads for products that I would have no use for. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>A.I. DATA MINING FTL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Now please don't take this as permission to go through all my data so you can find my favourite band and show me ads of other songs I might like. &nbsp;I kinda like having some semblance of privacy on the net. &nbsp;I don't want ads aimed at me but aimed at the area of interest that the content I am viewing is about. &nbsp;Because you never know what new things, in a field that you are interested in, that you may like. &nbsp;And maybe I will dislike what you are showing me and be annoyed that you are keeping me from the content I am trying to view. &nbsp;Which brings me to my next point. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN YOUR FACE! IN YOUR FACE! IN YOUR FACE! &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Ads can become a problem when they obscure or delay your viewing of the content you want. &nbsp;Even if the ad might be something you are interested in, it does not need to block the content at hand. &nbsp;Personally I don't mind click ads on the side of a website or links that I should check out. &nbsp;It can take away from the aesthetics of the site but as long as they do not hinder what I am reading, looking at or watching, then go ahead and tell me, with honesty, what you want me to look at next. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That is just my two cents. &nbsp;How do you feel about ads?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/74kcegup7/ads.jpg\" width=\"294\" height=\"119\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

You know the ones. &nbsp;The ones that hope the three outs pass before the ball makes it to the outfield. &nbsp;Come on strike-out! &nbsp;I like to hit the ball, but the whole catching and throwing thing was not for me. &nbsp;I couldn't kick in soccer and apparently you need something called co-ordination for tennis. &nbsp;Basketball required dribbling, so that was out and football was a time to chill on the bench. &nbsp;I never played rugby but I'm sure I would suck at it. &nbsp;Golf is a no unless it is mini. &nbsp;Surfing involves balance and I would sink like a stone at the first wave. &nbsp;Skateboarding lead to ripped pants and scrapped knees. &nbsp;I was not winning an olympic medal when we did our track and field events in school. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hockey, ha! &nbsp;I was happy if I didn't fall on my ass when I was skating. &nbsp;I was not bad at bowling, so that is something. &nbsp;The point is (if there is a point) is if you did suck at sports, you are not alone. &nbsp;I wanted to be on the bench with a pad and a pencil drawing. &nbsp;So if you are or were like me, don't sweat it, find your own ways to stay in shape, eat right and embarce your lack of strength, speed and co-ordination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>About ten years ago, maybe five, internet dating got saddled with this idea that if you use it there was something wrong with you. &nbsp;That you were socially awkward and had trouble finding a date in real life. &nbsp;But the same things were said when you were a nerd. &nbsp;It wasn't that long ago that nerds were at the bottom of the popularity chart and now it's almost uncool if you are not one. &nbsp;Things and people change. &nbsp;So today, @funny is announcing that internet dating is not for losers. &nbsp;Why do I say this? &nbsp;Well here is a list of reasons why internet dating is a legit, and sometimes better, way to meet new people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>&nbsp;You Mean You Have A Personalitiy</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>If you meet someone at a bar or club what are you really basing your decision on. &nbsp;It's simple, you're basing it on looks and looks alone. &nbsp;I'm not going to argue how important looks are, or are are not, in a relationship but I can tell you, if you don't have anything in common, the relationship is going to suffer. &nbsp;There are cases, and this is rare, when you happen to see a tattoo of something the person likes that you like as well, but even if that is the case, basing a relationship on one common interest isn't a solid plan. &nbsp;And yes, you can argue that internet dating is shallow as well, people with hot pictures are the ones getting more messages. &nbsp;But under that picture is a bio and depending on the site, other information about the person beside how they look in a swimsuit. &nbsp;It may not be a lot but it is something. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>&nbsp;Get To Know The Person First &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;So you flash a smile at a club and the person comes over. &nbsp;You try to make funny banter in their ear but they can't hear a word you're saying. &nbsp;But they think you're cute, so they smile and start to dance with you. &nbsp;Maybe you end up exchanging numbers or a kiss in the corner of the club. &nbsp;That is great, but what did you really learn about the person. &nbsp;I have had times, and yes I am embarrased to admit this, where I wasn't even sure of the woman's name when I called her. &nbsp;It was loud, I didn't hear, not for my fault. &nbsp;Needless to say that relationship didn't work out. &nbsp;But when you meet someone online you have to converse with them. &nbsp;There has to be some kind of back and forth before a meetup is agreed upon. &nbsp;For some people it a quick hey let's meet for coffee and others it may be months of late night conversations, but either way the option to really talk is presented in every case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Less Pressure</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;It's easier, in a way, to be yourself on the net. &nbsp;You can tell people things about yourself that you would have trouble saying in person. &nbsp;There is no fear of what the other person will say or how they will look at you and once you are comfortable that this person likes the real you then you can decide to meet. &nbsp;And there is the added benefit of being able to end the conversation anytime without any awkwardness. &nbsp;It can take months to tell someone things about you that you can spill out online in an conversation and see how they react. &nbsp;And if the getting to know the person doesn't work out, you can send a friendly goodbye message and move on to someone else. &nbsp;No need to have to wait until the date is over as you look at the clock every five minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>I Don't Have The Time To Meet People</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>That isn't jsut an excuse. &nbsp;People are busy and dating takes time. &nbsp;Meeting people even takes time. &nbsp;When you go out to a club or bar, you have to get ready, get there and spend, who knows how long, trying to make eye contact, or 'bump into', someone who wants to be 'bumped into' by you. &nbsp;That is if the person even wants to be bothered to chat. &nbsp;There are people who go to clubs because they want to dance or unwind and they don't want to be bothered by some one who is looking for a date. &nbsp;Plus it gets expensive. &nbsp;There are cover charges, costs of transport, drinks. &nbsp;And if you do meet someone you can only get to know them so much in the bar, so that means going on a date, which costs more money. &nbsp;It adds up, especially when you are meeting a lot of people who are not right for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>&nbsp;I'm Shy </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with being shy. &nbsp;Some people need time before they are comfortable putting themselves out there. &nbsp;Who cares. &nbsp;You are worth it and you want to find someone who knows that. &nbsp;And maybe you are a bit \"weird\" by some people's standards. &nbsp;Again, who cares. &nbsp;Okay techincally this doesn't argue agianst being social awkward. &nbsp;But if you are, so what, good for you. &nbsp;We all have our quirks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now I know there are negatives. &nbsp;There are people who are not who they say are and times when you meet someone online that you click with over the net but don't seem to gel with when you meet up in person. &nbsp;It is not perfect. &nbsp;And yeah there are benefits to meeting people in person rather than online. But that does not take away from the benefits that online dating has. &nbsp;It is an option, a very viable one, of meeting people and you, if you choose to use it, should not feel lesser for doing so.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/ux7ur7i85/relationship.jpg\" width=\"578\" height=\"261\"/></p>\n</html>",

But getting a higher number of yeses shouldn't be your goal, especially if you are looking for a long-term serious relationship. &nbsp;What you want is to find that one person, the one who is going to be there for the real you. &nbsp;That one who knows who you are on your good days and your bad and will still stick it out for you when you are at your worse. &nbsp;If you waste all your time impressing the wrong people, you might miss your chance with the right ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I was younger and didn't know better, I had made mistakes of acting in a way that I thought the person I liked wanted me to act like. &nbsp;And I have seen times when others have done it for me. &nbsp;We have all been there. &nbsp;Maybe its something small, like you pretend to like a band that you would never listen to, or something bigger, like pretending your an outdoors person when really all you want to do is stay home on a Saturday night in your pajamas. &nbsp;And this can work at first. &nbsp;If you are good enough at understanding what the other person likes, and wants, you can give it to them. &nbsp;But how long can you do it before it becomes a chore? &nbsp;When you start to act \"differently\" because you start to voice what you really think. &nbsp;At some point the person who you are will start to surface. &nbsp;Or worse it won't and that pushed down resentment can lead to some bad moods and arguements down the line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So give it a try. &nbsp;You are going to meet a lot of people that you will not, in one way or another, click with. &nbsp;That is just fine. &nbsp;So is being rejected. &nbsp;It does not feel great when it happens, but it happens. &nbsp;You are no worse off then before you got rejected. &nbsp;And who knows how much time you would have wasted chasing the wrong person. &nbsp;Be smart about your time and just be yourself.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/4opjeayxh/relationship.jpg\" width=\"578\" height=\"261\"/></p>\n</html>",

Remember steemit is new. &nbsp;If you want it to thrive as a place for intelligent articles then post intelligent articles. &nbsp;Upvote and seach for intelligent articles. &nbsp;It is an open space to grow as each of you sees fit. &nbsp;And it is a big enough space that though-provoking debates and fart jokes can exist side-by-side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So as we move forward with steemit and see new users continue to join the site, keep posting, improving yourself, upvoting and commenting and the odds are you will find your success on here.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

We all have our bad days. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Do What You Like, Sorta &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are getting to the point where different fields are getting more and more opportunities for people to work for themselves. &nbsp;You want to drive, you got Uber. &nbsp;You like to make videos, Youtube. &nbsp;Writers and photographers now have Steemit. &nbsp;It is not perfect, you will still need to work within the frame of the site in order to have any success, but at least you can work somewhat in the field of your choice. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>No Limits &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your audience is the internet, which means your audience is the world. &nbsp;If you want to blog you are only limited by how much work you want to do to post and build your network. &nbsp;There is always something to do, and if you start to get some traction on your content, the rewards can be massive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>CONS &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>You Don't Have To Wear Pants &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is easy to fall into bad habits when your appearance doesn't matter. &nbsp;I guess I can go another day without combing my hair, who is going to know. &nbsp;I can start that diet next week, lots of time. &nbsp;In order to keep healthy, good habitats have to be kept by you and only you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Working 9 to 9 &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;You thought you would work less becuase you are working from home? &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;It is a common misconception, one that is easy to make, that working from home means you will be working less. &nbsp;But it is the opposite. &nbsp;You are on your own to make it work which means you will have to do every aspect yourself to get your content or product off the ground. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Payday Is Any Day Now &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No steady paycheque is one of the biggest issues that faces people who want to work from home. &nbsp;And there is no guaranteed income. &nbsp;You can end up putting in a lot of hours into something and see little or no return. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get Ready To Dance &nbsp;&nbsp;Life on the internet is about getting your name out there. &nbsp;Which means you will have to do a lot of self-promotion, regardless of the field that you are. &nbsp;This can make people uncomfortable, especially when they don't like to talk about themselves. Figuring out when and how to tell people about your content can be stressful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&nbsp;Competition Is High &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every legit new site that gives you an opportunity to make money online quickly gets front-runners. &nbsp;And once that threshold is hit, it becomes difficult for new users to find a spot to make their mark. &nbsp;Don't give up, but know it can be a tough hill to climb.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/neti7sel1/keyboardphoto.jpg\" width=\"653\" height=\"368\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Hey steemites, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Having been on the network for over a month I have come across and figured out some helpful tips for using the network. &nbsp;Here is a compiled list below. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Long, well-written articles tend to do better than shorter posts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Don't forget about commenting, well-liked comments get paid as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022In order to do a link, highlight the text you want to add the link to, click the link icon and paste the link in the box. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022Remember this system uses a blockchain, so everything you post will be permantly saved somewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Yes I can not deny having a niche can help you build your profile faster, but you're a person not a brand, you want to randomly post about flowers and motorcycles, go for it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Don't be intimidated if you know nothing about bitcoins or blockchains or anything with the word crypto in front of it. &nbsp;This is a forum like any other, as it grows so will the topics. &nbsp;If there isn't a topic about something you want to post about then start it yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022You don't have to be an english major to blog, find your voice and write about your expertise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Sometimes your post will be on at a bad time and fall under the radar. &nbsp;Don't be discouraged. &nbsp;I personally think its okay to repost it especailly since we currently don't have views.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022If you see something you like, upvote it. &nbsp;It is only polite. &nbsp;&nbsp;You help out the author and you get paid for it. The amounts are still not set but even if it is low it is still payment to vote. &nbsp;There are a lot worse ways to make money.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022But don't just scroll and upvote everything you see. &nbsp;Integrity goes a long way to keeping a system fair. &nbsp;And your voting power takes time to reset to full.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022WRITE DOWN YOUR PASSWORD AND KEEP IT SOMEWHERE SAFE! &nbsp;There is no password recovery system here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022There are several free image hosting sites you can use to link photos from. &nbsp;Upload your photo, copy the link and post it in the image box. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022The Steemit white paper is like an instruction manuel. &nbsp;Keep in mind changes are still being made. &nbsp;Read it here. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Take time with your title, make it catchy without being misleading. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022Your blog tab is all the \"submit a story\" you posted, while the post tab includes your comments as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Steemit is not a link farm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Post your own work. &nbsp;Even camera phone photos are better than ones from the net.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022If you post photography make sure you add something that lets people know it is your photo. &nbsp;You don't want people to not upvote it becuase they don't know if it is taken from the internet or not and no one wants to do an image search on every photo. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022And finally, don't be an ass. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is more of a tip for life in general but hey, it applies here too. &nbsp;If you have any tips, please add them in the comments</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/w8jlv1uyj/steemit.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"147\"/></p>\n</html>",

Here are a few ways that steemit can become your primary job and not a source of extra income</p>\n<p><strong>Invest</strong></p>\n<p>This isn't unique to steemit, or even cryptocurrency really. &nbsp;Any time a new stock is available those who buy early can make a pretty penny off of it. &nbsp;But of course this option involves start-up capital to see any big results and will take time. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Write</strong></p>\n<p>The main way to earn income is to write articles that get upvoted. &nbsp;It is something that literally anyone can do and anyone can make it viral on here. &nbsp;I know that sounds like a load after you have worked hard on a post only to watch it sink into the blockchain abyss. &nbsp;But that happens. &nbsp;A lot of these people who are making good money from their posts are just random people who came on at the right time or told the right story. &nbsp;And yes some of them have boobs, as I have read people complaining about that, but that is not a requirement. &nbsp;I don't have boobs (well when I'm up in my weight that can be argued) and I know no one here and look how much money this post is making (that is your cue to upvote this post)&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Living Off Interest and Steem</strong></p>\n<p>I had a thought the other day. &nbsp;If you could build up enough steem power and if steem was worth enough money, you could power down and have a weekly paycheck. &nbsp;That is one of the advantages of the 104 payments of your power down over the two years. &nbsp;You can have a steady paycheck and (I think) collect more steem from the steem that is in there. &nbsp;That will help a lot of people who are, lets be honest, bad with money. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Time will show us how well the average user can earn on Steemit but as I said, it is looking positive</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s32.postimg.org/464u9ye8l/steemit.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"147\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Before I start I want to say depending on how blockchains work and networks like steemit, this article may become obsolete. &nbsp;But for now ads are not going anywhere anytime soon, so let's discuss ways of making them less annoying. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;BUT ALL THE COOL KIDS ARE DOING IT &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The world we live in now is one of transparency. &nbsp;Everyone understands, in some extent, how advertising works. &nbsp;We are not stupid. &nbsp;We know you want us to buy your drink, wear your shoes and see your movies. &nbsp;&nbsp;You want us to see cool people using your product and have us see enough of it that it appears in our dreams. &nbsp;But we don't need to be tricked. &nbsp;And we don't want to be lied to. &nbsp;You don't need to \"sell\" us anything. &nbsp;If you present people with something they might want to try or buy, they might actually be happy to click on the ad or watch the commerical. &nbsp;The process should not be one of selling but informing, and letting people decide for themselves. &nbsp;But in order to do this the advertisement needs to match the content where the ad is being placed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IT COMES DOWN TO THE WHERE &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Look at movie theatre previews. &nbsp;Everybody loves them. &nbsp;A lot of people even make sure they show up early so they don't miss them. &nbsp;Technically those previews as just ads. &nbsp;Ads for other movies you might want to see. &nbsp;But why do people enjoy them? &nbsp;Because the odds are that the people who are at the movies are people who like to go to the movies. &nbsp;This is an audience who is interested in what is coming up next. &nbsp;However when you start to play commercials for other prodcuts before a film, it may lower the chances of a captivated audience. &nbsp;It is the same regardless of media and topic. &nbsp;If you are watching a golf tournament, previews about other golf events might be of interest. &nbsp;But a commercial for a new clothing line has a higher chance of being a miss. &nbsp;Same for ads on websites, I have seen ads on social media that I would never click on, ads for products that I would have no use for. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A.I. DATA MINING FTL &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Now please don't take this as permission to go through all my data so you can find my favourite band and show me ads of other songs I might like. &nbsp;I kinda like having some semblance of privacy on the net. &nbsp;I don't want ads aimed at me but aimed at the area of interest that the content I am viewing is about. &nbsp;Because you never know what new things, in a field that you are interested in, that you may like. &nbsp;And maybe I will dislike what you are showing me and be annoyed that you are keeping me from the content I am trying to view. &nbsp;Which brings me to my next point. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IN YOUR FACE! IN YOUR FACE! IN YOUR FACE! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ads can become a problem when they obscure or delay your viewing of the content you want. &nbsp;Even if the ad might be something you are interested in, it does not need to block the content at hand. &nbsp;Personally I don't mind click ads on the side of a website or links that I should check out. &nbsp;It can take away from the aesthetics of the site but as long as they do not hinder what I am reading, looking at or watching, then go ahead and tell me, with honesty, what you want me to look at next. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That is just my two cents. &nbsp;How do you feel about ads?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/ymnjsj7nf/Untitled.jpg\" width=\"147\" height=\"111\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>First of all, congratulations to everyone who is making good money from their posts. &nbsp;I'm not hating at all, good for you for putting in the work and figuring out how to be smart (and honest) about it. &nbsp;If you are on the lower end of the spectrum or are just joining (welcome) know that it is possible to make money here if you work and work smart. &nbsp;I literally just joined this site about a month ago and I know nobody here, so don't worry about feeling excluded. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>But No One Liked My Post</strong></p>\n<p>It happens. &nbsp;Some of your posts might sky rocket, while others might never get off the ground. &nbsp;Don't take it personally. &nbsp;Sometimes it is the timing of the post. &nbsp;If no one is looking at what is new when your blog is posted it will quickly get pushed down the feed as new posts come. &nbsp;Or maybe it is a topic that is not popular on steemit yet. &nbsp;It might take you some time to build an audience for it. &nbsp;Keep pushing. &nbsp;There are people on here who will support you for your interests because they are happy to have variety on the site. &nbsp;And do take a second to think about what you could do better. &nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it is you. &nbsp;Not being mean, EVERY ONE of us has written posts that were less than stellar. &nbsp;Part of getting good at anything is practice, which includes real-world experience of sucking. &nbsp;Has to happen for us all. &nbsp;If your post wasn't great, see why and work to improve it the next time. &nbsp;But again, never take it personally. &nbsp;Even the greatest writers have written garbage. &nbsp;The difference is they tear it up and drink themselves to sleep while we post it on the internet. &nbsp;We are more public about our failures nowadays.</p>\n<p><strong>Be Happy For The Success Of Others</strong></p>\n<p>You say you spent a couple of days or weeks working hard on an article that no one liked, while someone took a quick photo of their cat and made thousands of dollars. &nbsp;Welcome to the internet. &nbsp;Yeah it can be discouraging. &nbsp;I never said it's right. &nbsp;And I think, with networks like steemit, we are starting to move in a direction where quality is what pays. &nbsp;But for now, like every other social media and forum site, random stuff will sometimes blow hard work out of the water. &nbsp;That doesn't mean you should hate on those posts. &nbsp;No one likes a complainer. &nbsp;Do not be one of those jerk crabs that tries to grab the escaping crap and pull them back into the bucket (to anyone thinking, okay that was random, read the steemit whitepaper for the story of the crabs). &nbsp;Neither should you stop trying to improve yourself and your work. &nbsp;Instead focus on what you want the site to look like and what posts you think should be rewarded. Remember steemit is new. &nbsp;If you want it to thrive as a place for intelligent articles then post intelligent articles. &nbsp;Upvote and seach for intelligent articles. &nbsp;It is an open space to grow as each of you sees fit. &nbsp;And it is a big enough space that though-provoking debates and fart jokes can exist side-by-side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So as we move forward with steemit and see new users continue to join the site, keep posting, improving yourself, upvoting and commenting and the odds are you will find your success on here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

We all have our bad days.</p>\n<p><strong>Do What You Like, Sorta</strong></p>\n<p>We are getting to the point where different fields are getting more and more opportunities for people to work for themselves. &nbsp;You want to drive, you got Uber. &nbsp;You like to make videos, Youtube. &nbsp;Writers and photographers now have Steemit. &nbsp;It is not perfect, you will still need to work within the frame of the site in order to have any success, but at least you can work somewhat in the field of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong>No Limits</strong></p>\n<p>Your audience is the internet, which means your audience is the world. &nbsp;If you want to blog you are only limited by how much work you want to do to post and build your network. &nbsp;There is always something to do, and if you start to get some traction on your content, the rewards can be massive.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>CONS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You Don't Have To Wear Pants</strong></p>\n<p>It is easy to fall into bad habits when your appearance doesn't matter. &nbsp;I guess I can go another day without combing my hair, who is going to know. &nbsp;I can start that diet next week, lots of time. &nbsp;In order to keep healthy, good habitats have to be kept by you and only you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Working 9 to 9</strong></p>\n<p>You thought you would work less becuase you are working from home? &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;It is a common misconception, one that is easy to make, that working from home means you will be working less. &nbsp;But it is the opposite. &nbsp;You are on your own to make it work which means you will have to do every aspect yourself to get your content or product off the ground. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Payday Is Any Day Now</strong></p>\n<p>No steady paycheque is one of the biggest issues that faces people who want to work from home. &nbsp;And there is no guaranteed income. &nbsp;You can end up putting in a lot of hours into something and see little or no return. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Get Ready To Dance</strong></p>\n<p>Life on the internet is about getting your name out there. &nbsp;Which means you will have to do a lot of self-promotion, regardless of the field that you are. &nbsp;This can make people uncomfortable, especially when they don't like to talk about themselves. Figuring out when and how to tell people about your content can be stressful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Competition Is High</strong></p>\n<p>Every legit new site that gives you an opportunity to make money online quickly gets front-runners. &nbsp;And once that threshold is hit, it becomes difficult for new users to find a spot to make their mark. &nbsp;Don't give up, but know it can be a tough hill to climb. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Hey Steemites (I think that one is my favourite),</p>\n<p>Having been on the network for about a month I have come across and figured out some helpful tips for using the network. &nbsp;Here is a compiled list below.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Long, well-written articles tend to do better than shorter posts.</li>\n  <li>Don't forget about commenting, well-liked comments get paid as well.</li>\n  <li>In order to do a link, highlight the text you want to add the link to, click the link icon and paste the link in the box. &nbsp;Like<a href=\"https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@funny/the-real-reason-you-need-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency\"> this</a></li>\n  <li>Remember this system uses a blockchain, so everything you post will be permantly saved somewhere.</li>\n  <li>Yes I can not deny having a niche can help you build your profile faster, but you're a person not a brand, you want to randomly post about flowers and motorcycles, go for it.</li>\n  <li>Don't be intimidated if you know nothing about bitcoins or blockchains or anything with the word crypto in front of it. &nbsp;This is a forum like any other, as it grows so will the topics. &nbsp;If there isn't a topic about something you want to post about then start it yourself.</li>\n  <li>You don't have to be an english major to blog, find your voice and write about your expertise.</li>\n  <li>Sometimes your post will be on at a bad time and fall under the radar. &nbsp;Don't be discouraged. &nbsp;I personally think its okay to repost it especailly since we currently don't have views.</li>\n  <li>If you see something you like, upvote it. &nbsp;It is only polite. &nbsp;&nbsp;You help out the author and you get paid for it. The amounts are still not set but even if it is low it is still payment to vote. &nbsp;There are a lot worse ways to make money.</li>\n  <li>But don't just scroll and upvote everything you see. &nbsp;Integrity goes a long way to keeping a system fair.&nbsp; And your voting power takes time to reset to full.</li>\n  <li>WRITE DOWN YOUR PASSWORD AND KEEP IT SOMEWHERE SAFE! &nbsp;There is no password recovery system here.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>There are several free image hosting sites you can use to link photos from. &nbsp;Upload your photo, copy the link and post it in the image box.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>The Steemit white paper is like an instruction manuel. &nbsp;Keep in mind changes are still being made. &nbsp;Read it <a href=\"https://steem.io/SteemWhitePaper.pdf\">here. &nbsp;</a></li>\n  <li>Take time with your title, make it catchy without being misleading. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Your blog tab is all the \"submit a story\" you posted, while the post tab includes your&nbsp;comments as well.</li>\n  <li>Steemit is not a link farm.</li>\n  <li>Post your own work. &nbsp;Even camera phone photos are better than ones from the net.</li>\n  <li>If you post photography make sure you add something that lets people know it is your photo. &nbsp;You don't want people to not upvote it becuase they don't know if it is taken from the internet or not and no one wants to do an image search on every photo.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>And finally, don't be an ass. &nbsp;This is more of a tip for life in general but hey, it applies here too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any tips, please add them in the comments</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;Written by @funny</em></p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(article has been edited)</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Before I start I want to say depending on how blockchains work and networks like steemit, this article may become obsolete. &nbsp;But for now ads are not going anywhere anytime soon, so let's discuss ways of making them less annoying.</p>\n<p><strong>BUT ALL THE COOL KIDS ARE DOING IT</strong></p>\n<p>The world we live in now is one of transparency. &nbsp;Everyone understands, in some extent, how advertising works. &nbsp;We are not stupid. &nbsp;We know you want us to buy your drink, wear your shoes and see your movies. &nbsp; You want us to see cool people using your product and have us see enough of it that it appears in our dreams. &nbsp;But we don't need to be tricked. &nbsp;And we don't want to be lied to. &nbsp;You don't need to \"sell\" us anything. &nbsp;If you present people with something they might want to try or buy, they might actually be happy to click on the ad or watch the commerical. &nbsp;The process should not be one of selling but informing, and letting people decide for themselves. &nbsp;But in order to do this the advertisement needs to match the content where the ad is being placed. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>IT COMES DOWN TO THE WHERE</strong></p>\n<p>Look at movie theatre previews. &nbsp;Everybody loves them. &nbsp;A lot of people even make sure they show up early so they don't miss them. &nbsp;Technically those previews as just ads. &nbsp;Ads for other movies you might want to see. &nbsp;But why do people enjoy them? &nbsp;Because the odds are that the people who are at the movies are people who like to go to the movies. &nbsp;This is an audience who is interested in what is coming up next. &nbsp;However when you start to play commercials for other prodcuts before a film, it may lower the chances of a captivated audience. &nbsp;It is the same regardless of media and topic. &nbsp;If you are watching a golf tournament, previews about other golf events might be of interest. &nbsp;But a commercial for a new clothing line has a higher chance of being a miss. &nbsp;Same for ads on websites, I have seen ads on social media that I would never click on, ads for products that I would have no use for.</p>\n<p><strong>A.I. DATA MINING FTL&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Now please don't take this as permission to go through all my data so you can find my favourite band and show me ads of other songs I might like. &nbsp;I kinda like having some semblance of privacy on the net. &nbsp;I don't want ads aimed at me but aimed at the area of interest that the content I am viewing is about. &nbsp;Because you never know what new things, in a field that you are interested in, that you may like. &nbsp;And maybe I will dislike what you are showing me and be annoyed that you are keeping me from the content I am trying to view. &nbsp;Which brings me to my next point.</p>\n<p><strong>IN YOUR FACE! IN YOUR FACE! IN YOUR FACE!</strong></p>\n<p>Ads can become a problem when they obscure or delay your viewing of the content you want. &nbsp;Even if the ad might be something you are interested in, it does not need to block the content at hand. &nbsp;Personally I don't mind click ads on the side of a website or links that I should check out. &nbsp;It can take away from the aesthetics of the site but as long as they do not hinder what I am reading, looking at or watching, then go ahead and tell me, with honesty, what you want me to look at next.</p>\n<p>That is just my two cents. &nbsp;How do you feel about ads? &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<em>Exclusive article written for steemit by @funny</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Being paid properly for online content is an issue we have yet to solve. &nbsp;There are some sites which don't pay enough and others that pay a small percentage of the content-creators a large percentage of the profits. &nbsp;It is a difficult problem to assess. &nbsp;You give too much money for quantity and you get flooded with garbage. &nbsp;If you give too little then it is not worth the effort of the person making the content. &nbsp;And even if the money is good, the amount of work available may not be. &nbsp;Some sites offer a small amount of jobs, which are quickly taken. &nbsp;While other sites only request pieces on certain topics that can be too limiting for a lot of creatives. &nbsp;This results in a challenging path for anyone who wants to make a living from their craft.</p>\n<p><strong>DOES REPUTATION MATTER?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes it does and the problem is it does a little too much. &nbsp;When a user becomes known on a lot of sites their work becomes featured. &nbsp;They get more opportunities, more views and the value of their word, their photos and/or their video goes up. &nbsp;And more power to them. &nbsp;People who have worked hard, deserve it. &nbsp;But the problem is it is not a guarantee that if you work hard you will be rewarded. &nbsp;A lucky post at the right time can go viral, while a person can spend years perfecting their craft and barely make any money. &nbsp;This leads to a very big gap for new users. &nbsp;They should never give up, but it is very discouraging to submit a piece of work in a sea of content and hope that enough people see and promote it. &nbsp;It can feel as productive as throwing change into a wishing well. &nbsp;And this results in the line between the rich and the poor becoming too thick, a problem we see plague us elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>CAN SEO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD?</strong></p>\n<p>SEO can help any person or business get their work out there. &nbsp;Knowing how to present your article with keywords and meta tags will lead to an increase in views, even if you are a lesser-known content-creator. &nbsp;However, the problem becomes that this, in itself, is a full time job. &nbsp;Learning how to master SEO takes research and work, and it is a field that is constantly changing. &nbsp;It is the same with learning to self-promote. &nbsp;You can spend all your time becoming a professional at promoting your work and you start to forget what your work was in the first place. &nbsp;A lot of creatives just want to work and improve in their field without feeling like they need to learn how to \"sell themselves\".</p>\n<p><strong>TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION</strong></p>\n<p>This is why steemit and other sites that pay for original content are great for content-creators. &nbsp;There is no limit to what you want to post about and if people want to read about it, you will be rewarded. &nbsp;Having your posts show up in a public forum without being filtered means all users have the chance to get an audience for their work and lets the people decide if it is something they want to read. &nbsp;Sites like steemit usually get this done by running ads and it is yet to see if funding with blockchain technology is a sustainable system. &nbsp;But as we find better ways to fund people for their work, we are starting to see sites emerge that are giving people who want to pursue their craft a way of making a living.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>I like it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I guess I should probably say more :p The system works very well for blogging and I can see it being a serious website for article writers and bloggers. Being rewarded based on upvotes helps to self-moderate the quality of the content and posts with a lot of upvotes, from what I am seeing, are going to be paid well. But the system could use the ability to see views. It is difficult to tell if your content needs work, is not the cup of tea to the people reading it or just uploaded at a bad time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The editor is easy enough to use for typing and formating, but could be a little more user-friendly for sharing images. &nbsp;Pictures need to be uploaed to a seperate site and linked before they show, which is a little cumbersome for people who just want to type, upload and post. &nbsp;But the plus side is that posts stay as drafts until you clear them, a nice feature if you decide to leave the page by choice or by accident.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In terms of content, there is a lot of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency posts, which is to be expected and will only be an assist when the other topics of discussion start to match it in volume. If the site is organized properly, there is space for multiple topics of interest to thrive. More and more topics should open up as the user base continues to grow. And if you are interested in bitcoin or blockchains this is the place for you to post and find articles of interest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The social media aspect of the site is currently not one of its strengths. There isn't a network of friends or followers. You can follow someone but it only puts their posts in the recommendation list. And without notifications you can't tell if someone you are following posted. But the biggest problem (which is the networks biggest strengths in other areas) is that everything you post is permanently somewhere on the blockchain, which is going to lead to people being hesitant to post. People want to know they can delete things for whatever reason whenever they wish. On the upside, what hinders the social side of the network does help with the article side. Permanent posts means people will be more careful with editing. And not having your network's posts blogging your feed, you are more likely to discover new users and they in turn, are more likely to get votes. I would even go so far to suggest making the posts should be listed as anonymous until after the person votes for them. This will improve quality and give new users a better chance to get their articles seen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall the system itself has a lot of potential and like every other social media or forum website, will all depend on the people who join and the quality they posts. But still being beta, there is lots of time for the system to work out any hitches along the way.</p>\n</html>",

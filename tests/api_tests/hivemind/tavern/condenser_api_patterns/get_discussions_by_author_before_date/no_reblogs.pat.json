Do you want something that will last long enough that it will come up in search results for the future? &nbsp;Or do you want something that will drive heavy traffic for a short period of time? &nbsp;And is it possible to do both? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Power Of Timeless &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It seems like a funny idea having something timeless on the internet. &nbsp;One of the things the net does best is the constant uploading of new, exciting and current &nbsp;information. &nbsp;But some posts, mostly how-to guides, can be shared and discussed for years to come. &nbsp;This is a matter of what you are writing about. &nbsp;Techniques that are proven to work, even if new techniques come out, are timeless. &nbsp;Ideas can be timeless. &nbsp;You are timeless. &nbsp;There is only one you and stories about your life that are positive and inspiring, regardless of the era that they happened in, can always be shared. And the internet is not always as fast as people think it is. &nbsp;As quickly as the search engine can archive something, it still takes time to be seen. &nbsp;Even if the post is worth sharing, it will still need to be found by someone, they in turn have to read it and then share it, the people on their network have to see it and read it and share it and so on and so forth. &nbsp;Unless you have a forum with an established reader list, your blog will take time to get out there. &nbsp;Blogs get archived. &nbsp;And no one is going to care about the 2016 election when 2017 rolls around &nbsp;Slow and steady can win the race, but it also can be at a disadvantage in the faster paced world of the internet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Power Of The Trend &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The way the system is set up now, I cannot deny the power of the trend. &nbsp;If you mention Hillary or Trump in my article title there is a better chance that people will click it. &nbsp;People are searching for things that are current. &nbsp;Even in their own field of interest, people want to know what is new. &nbsp;Techniques and technological advancements are present in every field. &nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn't take away what has worked but when you are looking for viewers, a lot of them want new. Plus when you write about something current, it is being talked about. You can be apart of the conversation and gain momentum from other posts on the same subject. But trend is short lived. This means quality is going to pay a price. And if your post doesn't go viral soon, it will sit on your hard drive with little reuse factor in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Combining The Two &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course the best thing is to write an article that is both. &nbsp;But as the two can be at opposite ends, it may be difficult to achieve this. &nbsp;One stragety is to use &nbsp;a trending topic to introduce a more timeless idea or talk about a timeless idea with trending examples. &nbsp;For example, the examples I'm using in this blog about the the current election. &nbsp;This post has timeless elements to it, it should be useful as long as blogging and article writing are a part of the internet. &nbsp;But using examples of the current election in my title and in the post give it a relenvce factor. &nbsp;It makes the idea come to life and attracts users to the idea. &nbsp;Don't abuse that. &nbsp;It is easy to just staple a popular topic to a post to bring in views but that will angry and push away a lot of your readers. &nbsp;Think of a relevent topic that is a useful example or match for your ideas and if you pair the two properly, you can get the views for the post while keeping the article from fading quickly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, check out my other post about cryptocurrnecy which is sitting at over $100 atm.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/money/@funny/why-are-bitcoin-steem-and-other-cryptocoins-worth-real-money\">https://steemit.com/money/@funny/why-are-bitcoin-steem-and-other-cryptocoins-worth-real-money</a></p>\n<p>This is @funny, please upvote, follow and promote \")</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Because we, as a society, say it is. &nbsp;No really, I'm not being a smart ass. &nbsp;Okay the market is a little more complicated than that and the creation of a cryptocurrency is &nbsp;definitely more complicated than that. &nbsp;But when it comes down to it, steem, and other cryptocurrencys like bitcoin have value because we, as a society, have agreed that it is valauble. &nbsp;And the more people are willing to pay for it, and the less of it there is, the more it is worth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But can I buy food with it? &nbsp;Directly no. &nbsp;Not now at least. &nbsp;That may change if vendors decided they would accept steem as payment. &nbsp;But for now, steem cannot be used directly. &nbsp;But it can be exchanged for bitcoin which can be exchange for cash. &nbsp;There are websites that buy bitcoin for real currency and if steem really takes off we might see vendors who will deal with it directly for cash in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;So steem and bitcoin by themselves are worthless then? &nbsp;&nbsp;Not exactly. &nbsp;They do have value. &nbsp;From what I know, the transparency and permancy of the blockchain gives security to the currency. &nbsp;It is also easy to send and recieve, saving a lot of costs in the long run for companies and people who choose to deal in it. &nbsp;And steem does have a secondary function. &nbsp;If you are a company or a celebrity, steem yields you influence. &nbsp;Having your stuff seen over somebody else's is a big market on the internet. &nbsp;Look how much the advertising companeis bring in. &nbsp;So, in theory, if you were looking for a platform where you wanted your message to be heard and you didn't have time to build up a network, a large financial investment could guarantee that your posts get seen as long as the viewers are there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So let's all get rich on nothing then? &nbsp;Not that simple. &nbsp;And also very dangerous. This is why cryptocurrency cannot stand on it's one without a fiat currency. &nbsp;Steem didn't just have value because it was mined and now people want it so it's value is rising. &nbsp;Steemit had a $20 million dollar investment of real money that gave the steem value. &nbsp;When the steem was created it was paired with a real world value, so that the steem was already worth the equivilant of something in the real world (in this case USD). &nbsp;Then they gave a percentage out to the people who would in turn us it and want more it, increasing its value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I like to think of cryptocurrency as a diamond and maybe just because the mining metaphor works so well as does the 'diamonds are forever' saying. &nbsp;Diamonds in themselves are fairly useless. &nbsp;They do have some functions if you cut them properly and they are shiny (so shiny). &nbsp;But like cryptocurrency, you can't eat it, wear it or accomplish anything with it. &nbsp;Yet if someone asked if you wanted a sandwhich or a large diamond, you would take the diamond (unless you were literally about to starve to death). &nbsp;Cryptopcurrency works the same way. &nbsp;Each steem or bitcoin can be seen as a coin that is worth a lot more in value then it is in actual worth. &nbsp;And why is it worth that value, because, like a diamond, someone might be willing to pay you cash money to own it. But keep in mind there a lot of cryptocurrencies out there, and prices fluctuate, so be careful with any of your investments.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/z5x69j8vt/diamond_635332_640.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"412\"/></p>\n</html>",

Do you want something that will last long enough that it will come up in search results for the future? &nbsp;Or do you want something that will drive heavy traffic for a short period of time? &nbsp;And is it possible to do both? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Power Of Timeless &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It seems like a funny idea having something timeless on the internet. &nbsp;One of the things the net does best is the constant uploading of new, exciting and current &nbsp;information. &nbsp;But some posts, mostly how-to guides, can be shared and discussed for years to come. &nbsp;This is a matter of what you are writing about. &nbsp;Techniques that are proven to work, even if new techniques come out, are timeless. &nbsp;Ideas can be timeless. &nbsp;You are timeless. &nbsp;There is only one you and stories about your life that are positive and inspiring, regardless of the era that they happened in, can always be shared. And the internet is not always as fast as people think it is. &nbsp;As quickly as the search engine can archive something, it still takes time to be seen. &nbsp;Even if the post is worth sharing, it will still need to be found by someone, they in turn have to read it and then share it, the people on their network have to see it and read it and share it and so on and so forth. &nbsp;Unless you have a forum with an established reader list, your blog will take time to get out there. &nbsp;Blogs get archived. &nbsp;And no one is going to care about the 2016 election when 2017 rolls around &nbsp;Slow and steady can win the race, but it also can be at a disadvantage in the faster paced world of the internet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Power Of The Trend &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The way the system is set up now, I cannot deny the power of the trend. &nbsp;If you mention Hillary or Trump in my article title there is a better chance that people will click it. &nbsp;People are searching for things that are current. &nbsp;Even in their own field of interest, people want to know what is new. &nbsp;Techniques and technological advancements are present in every field. &nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn't take away what has worked but when you are looking for viewers, a lot of them want new. Plus when you write about something current, it is being talked about. You can be apart of the conversation and gain momentum from other posts on the same subject. But trend is short lived. This means quality is going to pay a price. And if your post doesn't go viral soon, it will sit on your hard drive with little reuse factor in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Combining The Two &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course the best thing is to write an article that is both. &nbsp;But as the two can be at opposite ends, it may be difficult to achieve this. &nbsp;One stragety is to use &nbsp;a trending topic to introduce a more timeless idea or talk about a timeless idea with trending examples. &nbsp;For example, the examples I'm using in this blog about the the current election. &nbsp;This post has timeless elements to it, it should be useful as long as blogging and article writing are a part of the internet. &nbsp;But using examples of the current election in my title and in the post give it a relenvce factor. &nbsp;It makes the idea come to life and attracts users to the idea. &nbsp;Don't abuse that. &nbsp;It is easy to just staple a popular topic to a post to bring in views but that will angry and push away a lot of your readers. &nbsp;Think of a relevent topic that is a useful example or match for your ideas and if you pair the two properly, you can get the views for the post while keeping the article from fading quickly. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is @funny, please upvote, follow an promote \") &nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/tcsb4ps8f/smartphone_friends_internet_connection.jpg\" width=\"630\" height=\"380\"/></p>\n<p>About ten years ago, maybe five, internet dating got saddled with this idea that if you use it there was something wrong with you. &nbsp;That you were socially awkward and had trouble finding a date in real life. &nbsp;But the same things were said when you were a nerd. &nbsp;It wasn't that long ago that nerds were at the bottom of the popularity chart and now it's almost uncool if you are not one. &nbsp;Things and people change. &nbsp;So @funny is announcing that internet dating is no longer something to scoff at. &nbsp;Why do I say this? &nbsp;Well here is a list of reasons why internet dating is a legit, and sometimes better, way to meet new people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You Mean You Have A Personality &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you meet someone at a bar or club what are you really basing your decision on. &nbsp;It's simple, you're basing it on looks and looks alone. &nbsp;I'm not going to argue how important looks are, or are are not, in a relationship but I can tell you, if you don't have anything in common, the relationship is going to suffer. &nbsp;There are cases, and this is rare, when you happen to see a tattoo of something the person likes that you like as well, but even if that is the case, basing a relationship on one common interest isn't a solid plan. &nbsp;And yes, you can argue that internet dating is shallow as well, people with hot pictures are the ones getting more messages. &nbsp;But under that picture is a bio and depending on the site, other information about the person beside how they look in a swimsuit. &nbsp;It may not be a lot but it is something. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Get To Know The Person First &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you flash a smile at a club and the person comes over. &nbsp;You try to make funny banter in their ear but they can't hear a word you're saying. &nbsp;But they think you're cute, so they smile and start to dance with you. &nbsp;Maybe you end up exchanging numbers or a kiss in the corner of the club. &nbsp;That is great, but what did you really learn about the person. &nbsp;I have had times, and yes I am embarrased to admit this, where I wasn't even sure of the woman's name when I called her. &nbsp;Needless to say that relationship didn't work out. &nbsp;But when you meet someone online you have to converse with them. &nbsp;There has to be some kind of back and forth before a meetup is agreed upon. &nbsp;For some people it a quick hey let's meet for coffee and others it may be months of late night conversations, but either way the option to really talk is presented in every case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Less Pressure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's easier, in a way, to be yourself on the net. &nbsp;You can tell people things about yourself that you would have trouble saying in person. &nbsp;There is no fear of what the other person will say or how they will look at you and once you are comfortable that this person likes the real you then you can decide to meet. &nbsp;And there is the added benefit of being able to end the conversation anytime without any awkwardness. &nbsp;It can take months to tell someone things about you that you can spill out online in an conversation and see how they react. &nbsp;And if the getting to know the person doesn't work out, you can send a friendly goodbye message and move on to someone else. &nbsp;No need to have to wait until the date is over as you look at the clock every five minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I Don't Have The Time To Meet People &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That isn't just an excuse. &nbsp;People are busy and dating takes time. &nbsp;Meeting people even takes time. &nbsp;When you go out to a club or bar, you have to get ready, get there and spend, who knows how long, trying to make eye contact, or 'bump into', someone who wants to be 'bumped into' by you. &nbsp;That is if the person even wants to be bothered to chat. &nbsp;There are people who go to clubs because they want to dance or unwind and they don't want to be bothered by some one who is looking for a date. &nbsp;Plus it gets expensive. &nbsp;There are cover charges, costs of transport, drinks. &nbsp;And if you do meet someone you can only get to know them so much in the bar, so that means going on a date, which costs more money. &nbsp;It adds up, especially when you are meeting a lot of people who are not right for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm Shy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with being shy. &nbsp;Some people need time before they are comfortable putting themselves out there. &nbsp;Who cares. &nbsp;You are worth it and you want to find someone who knows that. &nbsp;And maybe you are a bit \"weird\" by some people's standards. &nbsp;Again, who cares. &nbsp;Okay techincally this doesn't argue agianst being socially awkward. &nbsp;But if you are, so what, good for you. &nbsp;We all have our quirks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now I know there are negatives. &nbsp;There are people who are not who they say are and times when you meet someone online that you click with over the net but don't seem to gel with when you meet up in person. &nbsp;It is not perfect. &nbsp;And yeah there are benefits to meeting people in person rather than online. But that does not take away from the benefits that online dating has. &nbsp;It is an option, a very viable one, of meeting people and you, if you choose to use it, should not feel lesser for doing so.</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Telemarketing:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/if36xl2mp/marketing_man_person_communication.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I can tell you from experience, almost nobody who works at a call center wants to work at a call centre. They do not want to be there nor do they want to call you about whatever it is they are calling you about. So when somone calls you at a time when you are a busy and you make it clear to them, that you, have no desire to be on the phone with them, I assure you, that they, probably have no desire to be on the phone with you. They are not even the ones who dial the phone number to call you, it is literally a machine that dials your number and then your name pops up on the screen in front of them. They might be allowed some leeway to what they say to you but basically it is a hi and before they talk about whatever it is they are supposed to sell you. A lot of these employees do not even work for the company of the product they are trying to pitch. Call centres are owned by third parties who make calls on behalf of other companies. The person on the phone probably does not have stocks or interest in the company. They probably do not even get paid well to call you and bug you about whatever it is the company wants to bug you about. So when the poor bastard calls you, even if it is at the worse possible time, try to be nice to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The place I worked was above a mall. You would not even know it was there unless you had to visit it. The space was fairly large, an open area that was littered with rows and rows of desks. On each desk was a computer and a headset. You would sit at the desk, put the headset on, click that you are ready to go and the calls would start. A screen would pop up with the name of the person you are suppose to talk with and then you would go into your spiel of what you were trying to sell. When the person said no (as was the large majority of your calls) you would need to click a reason of why they said no before letting the call go before moving on to the next one. The time you waited in between was called downtime. This didn't last, it was ususally a few seconds before the next call came on. You don't even decide to take the call, as long as you are on the clock the calls keep coming. There is an option to pause it, but when you do a clock comes up that counts the time you are on break. Oh and when you are finished with a call and need to pick a reason you didn't get the sale, you are timed for that too. So that way you cannot hide in the menus between calls. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Every once in awhile someone would say yes. In order for the sale to go through it needs to be a clear YES on the phone (the calls are recorded). If it is not a clear yes, then you need to verify the positive affirmation again to make sure. Then comes the verbatim terms of the product. It was literally two pages long of terms and conditions that you had to read to the client word for word. If you messed up on any of it, then the quality team who listens to the sale could deny it. A lot of the times it is difficult to keep the person on the phone as you bore them with the terms, so you need to talk fast. To motivate you there is a team leader. Every dozen or so computers are sectioned off into a team. In front of each team is a whiteboard. This board has everybody's name on it and a space beside it where the team leader would write down how many sales you were getting. It could be pretty daunting to see how badly you are doing on the board in front of you. You are told that you are required to get so many sales an hour (it was usally 1-point-something, a number that was not easy to get) and they would check up on you if you are having trouble getting sales. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The saddest part of working there is how much no one wants to be there. You will probably never find a man or a woman who is there because that is the job they wanted. No one growing up says I want to be a telemarketer. There are people who have dreams of doing something else and are waiting for their chance, to young adults finding there way in the workforce, to parents looking for income for their family. It was kinda depressing. And the turnaround rate in ridiclous. I remember how many times you would see a new class of trainees learning the ropes of the system. The job is not one I would recommend to anyone unless you need the work and if you do, know that there are people out there that feel your pain.</p>\n<p>Taco Bell:</p>\n<p>Never be rude to anyone who works at a fast food place. &nbsp;People do no understand how rough a job it can be. &nbsp;You are dealing with a constant flood of costumers, all of whom are there for \"fast\" food and there are times when the line doesn't seem to end. &nbsp;When you work the window there is a timer on the screen that shows how long the person has been waiting since they ordered. &nbsp;It stares you down as it clicks second by second. &nbsp;To make matters worse, I worked at a taco bell that was in front of a mall. &nbsp;That's right a mall. &nbsp;&nbsp;And it was attached to a Pizza Hut. &nbsp;Between the pay and the poor work it really encourages you to stay in school. &nbsp;To anyone who is working there because they have to or are working hard at an extra job in their spare time, my hat is off to you. &nbsp;You do not get payed enough, regardless of what fast food chain you are working for. &nbsp;And to anyone who goes for a quick burger please please please be nice to the men and women who are behind the counter.</p>\n</html>",

This is why cryptocurrency cannot stand on it's one without a fiat currency. &nbsp;Steem didn't just have value because it was mined and now people want it so it's value is rising. &nbsp;Steemit had a $20 million dollar investment of real money that gave the steem value. &nbsp;When the steem was created it was paired with a real world value, so that the steem was already worth the equivilant of something in the real world (in this case USD). &nbsp;Then they gave a percentage out to the people who would in turn us it and want more it, increasing its value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I like to think of cryptocurrency as a diamond and maybe just because the mining metaphor works so well as does the 'diamonds are forever' saying. &nbsp;Diamonds in themselves are fairly useless. &nbsp;They do have some functions if you cut them properly and they are shiny (so shiny). &nbsp;But like cryptocurrency, you can't eat it, wear it or accomplish anything with it. &nbsp;Yet if someone asked if you wanted a sandwhich or a large diamond, you would take the diamond (unless you were literally about to starve to death). &nbsp;Cryptopcurrency works the same way. &nbsp;Each steem or bitcoin can be seen as a coin that is worth a lot more in value then it is in actual worth. &nbsp;And why is it worth that value, because, like a diamond, someone might be willing to pay you cash money to own it.&nbsp;But keep in mind there a lot of cryptocurrencies out there, and prices fluctuate, so be careful with any of your investments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/wwrfi26hl/diamond_635332_640.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"412\"/></p>\n</html>",

Do you want something that will last long enough that it will come up in search results for the future? &nbsp;Or do you want something that will drive heavy traffic for a short period of time? &nbsp;And is it possible to do both? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Power Of Timeless &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It seems like a funny idea having something timeless on the internet. &nbsp;One of the things the net does best is the constant uploading of new, exciting and current &nbsp;information. &nbsp;But some posts, mostly how-to guides, can be shared and discussed for years to come. &nbsp;This is a matter of what you are writing about. &nbsp;Techniques that are proven to work, even if new techniques come out, are timeless. &nbsp;Ideas can be timeless. &nbsp;You are timeless. &nbsp;There is only one you and stories about your life that are positive and inspiring, regardless of the era that they happened in, can always be shared. And the internet is not always as fast as people think it is. &nbsp;As quickly as the search engine can archive something, it still takes time to be seen. &nbsp;Even if the post is worth sharing, it will still need to be found by someone, they in turn have to read it and then share it, the people on their network have to see it and read it and share it and so on and so forth. &nbsp;Unless you have a forum with an established reader list, your blog will take time to get out there. &nbsp;Blogs get archived. &nbsp;And no one is going to care about the 2016 election when 2017 rolls around &nbsp;Slow and steady can win the race, but it also can be at a disadvantage in the faster paced world of the internet. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/m89pxog2v/numbers_time_watch_white.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\"/></p>\n<p>The Power Of The Trend &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The way the system is set up now, I cannot deny the power of the trend. &nbsp;If you mention Hillary or Trump in my article title there is a better chance that people will click it. &nbsp;People are searching for things that are current. &nbsp;Even in their own field of interest, people want to know what is new. &nbsp;Techniques and technological advancements are present in every field. &nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn't take away what has worked but when you are looking for viewers, a lot of them want new. Plus when you write about something current, it is being talked about. You can be apart of the conversation and gain momentum from other posts on the same subject. But trend is short lived. This means quality is going to pay a price. And if your post doesn't go viral soon, it will sit on your hard drive with little reuse factor in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/5lkaptr0x/light_person_woman_fire.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\"/></p>\n<p>Combining The Two &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course the best thing is to write an article that is both. &nbsp;But as the two can be at opposite ends, it may be difficult to achieve this. &nbsp;One stragety is to use &nbsp;a trending topic to introduce a more timeless idea or talk about a timeless idea with trending examples. &nbsp;For example, the examples I'm using in this blog about the the current election. &nbsp;This post has timeless elements to it, it should be useful as long as blogging and article writing are a part of the internet. &nbsp;But using examples of the current election in my title and in the post give it a relenvce factor. &nbsp;It makes the idea come to life and attracts users to the idea. &nbsp;Don't abuse that. &nbsp;It is easy to just staple a popular topic to a post to bring in views but that will angry and push away a lot of your readers. &nbsp;Think of a relevent topic that is a useful example or match for your ideas and if you pair the two properly, you can get the views for the post while keeping the article from fading quickly.</p>\n<p>This is @funny, please upvote, follow an promote \")</p>\n<p>(photos from pexels.com)</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Have you ever fallen into a pattern of behaviour with a group of people? &nbsp;Maybe you are the one who tells funny stories all the time or you are the one who tells others about the latest gagdets. &nbsp;It may be because you like comedy or love tech and are happy to share your interests. &nbsp;But there is a chance that your behaviour is the result of postive reactions from the previous times you started to do that behviour. &nbsp;If you share an app that no one heard of and everyone starts to use it, maybe it made you feel good. &nbsp;So you tell them about another one and still, another positve result. &nbsp;This carries over to the next week where you let everyone know about this cool new site called Steemit, which leads them to high five you after they make there first dollar. &nbsp;What begins to happen is you start to pay more attention to the tech world. &nbsp;You might go out of your way to look for new things to tell people about. &nbsp;And soon you become an expert who can spot the next thing from a mile away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is this idea that we tend to like what we are good at. Our interests and hobbies are, in a way, molded by the postive feelings we get from them. &nbsp;And being good at something is quite a positve feeling. &nbsp;Think of the things you enjoy doing. &nbsp;If it is something you put any considerable time into, it was probably because you had a knack for it. It is more likely you will follow a career in a field if you are quick to understand that field and feel like you can excel in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;And a lot of the time, since we are social creatures, excel-at-it is a relative term where other people acknowledge that you are good at it. &nbsp;It can come in the form of applause, laughter, good grades or money, but the external stimulus that you are getting that shows you are good at the thing you are doing is giving by someone else. This is why we need to encourage people and not be discoruaged ourselves when we fail at something. &nbsp;Getting good at anything takes practice. &nbsp;And if you have people giving you positive and realisitic (don't lie to someone if they are really bad at something) support, you might be suprised how far you can impove in a field of your choice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But we are not salvidating dogs. We are not animals. &nbsp;All the behaviour tests on animals in the world cannot fully help us to udnerstand huamns. &nbsp;People who like something will do it even if they suck at it and will do so with a smile on there face. &nbsp;And more power to them. &nbsp;Good for them rocking that shower ballad even when they are clearly tone deaf. &nbsp;People are more then how the outside world rewards them. &nbsp;And on top of that we are aware of why we likes things. &nbsp;Take this article for example, I can write about the idea of it because we can look outside of ourselves and see why we are doing what we do. &nbsp;Just something to think about the next time your eye wanders to that new tech article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/x3j07di7z/pexels_photo_65121_1.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\"/></p>\n<p>@funny - follow, promote, vote \")</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Steemit can be daunting when you start. &nbsp;You can post on literally anything. &nbsp;Or you can spend all your time looking at other posts as you upvote and comment them. &nbsp;Both can get you your start in the network and build you steem. &nbsp;But with so many people on this site already, and with so many more sure to join, you will want to utilize your time properly if you are going to see results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So what are you posting about? &nbsp;I recommend sticking with topics that you already have knowledge in at the start of your steemiting (yeah I made that a verb). &nbsp;When you already have a handle on the subject you can cut-down/out on time spent on preperation and research. &nbsp;I don't recommend getting stuck on one topic, cause you really will miss out if you don't continue to learn, but, when you need to build an account, you don't want to spend too much time reading other work when you need to produce your own. &nbsp;When you get a good start on steemit, built up steem power and are comfortable as a writer, then start to branch out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you need some topics to post about, here are some ideas: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022life (tell us about your first vacation, or that embarrasing story that always gets a laugh) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022hobbies (sports, gaming, shopping, movies, you have to have something you like to do and something that you are knowledgable about it. &nbsp;Find it and share it.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022teach us something (Where do you work? &nbsp;Bring your expertise over to steemit and blog about it) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022photography (Got the eye for it? &nbsp;Steemit is also a place where photos and video can be shared.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also make sure you give yourself a goal for the day regardless of the results that happen after your first post. &nbsp;Tell yourself that you are going to complete two articles today and post them. &nbsp;Even if the first article doesn't get well-recieved, don't get discouraged about the second one. &nbsp;Get it out of your head and push forward. &nbsp;Working hard when things seem glim in a trait that will help you a lot in anything you want to be successful in. &nbsp;Anyone can work when things are going well, but those that can make it through the rough patches will see an increase in their chances of success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now for the BIG mistake we are all making. &nbsp;Have you read the story of Narcissus? &nbsp;He thought he was so beautiful that he spent all his time staring at his reflection in the lake. &nbsp;Until one day he worried his reflecting was drowning, so he dived in after himself and ended up dead. &nbsp;Why am I telling you this story? &nbsp;Because like him, we all spend too much time admiring, or checking, our own work. &nbsp;Let's be honest, after you put you post out there you are pressing that F5 refresh button like mad to see how your post is doing. &nbsp;Then you wait five minutes and check it again. &nbsp;Maybe you check it again after another 5 minutes. &nbsp;We all do it. &nbsp;But this process is not only taking a lot of time but draining our mood and energy. &nbsp;If the post is doing well, great, don't get too cocky, just because you had one good post, it does not mean you don't have to work on the next ones. &nbsp;And if the post is doing bad, you will just make yourself less and less motivated with every click of the refresh button. &nbsp;Don't forget to check your articles later in the day to see what is working and reply to comments, but that time you waste watching how many upvotes you are getting is time that can be better spent elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/699h8yexz/pexels_photo_1.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"423\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And here are some other tips &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Long, well-written articles tend to do better than shorter posts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Don't forget about commenting, well-liked comments get paid as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022In order to do a link, highlight the text you want to add the link to, click the link icon and paste the link in the box. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Remember this system uses a blockchain, so everything you post will be permantly saved somewhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022Yes I can not deny having a niche can help you build your profile faster, but you're a person not a brand, you want to randomly post about flowers and motorcycles, go for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Don't be intimidated if you know nothing about bitcoins or blockchains or anything with the word crypto in front of it. &nbsp;This is a forum like any other, as it grows so will the topics. &nbsp;If there isn't a topic about something you want to post about then start it yourself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022You don't have to be an english major to blog, find your voice and write about your expertise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Sometimes your post will be on at a bad time and fall under the radar. &nbsp;Don't be discouraged. &nbsp;I personally think its okay to repost it especailly since we currently don't have views. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022If you see something you like, upvote it. &nbsp;It is only polite. &nbsp;&nbsp;You help out the author and you get paid for it. The amounts are still not set but even if it is low it is still payment to vote. &nbsp;There are a lot worse ways to make money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022But don't just scroll and upvote everything you see. &nbsp;Integrity goes a long way to keeping a system fair. &nbsp;And your voting power takes time to reset to full. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022WRITE DOWN YOUR PASSWORD AND KEEP IT SOMEWHERE SAFE! &nbsp;There is no password recovery system here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022There are several free image hosting sites you can use to link photos from. &nbsp;Upload your photo, copy the link and post it in the image box. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022The Steemit white paper is like an instruction manuel. &nbsp;Keep in mind changes are still being made. &nbsp;Read it here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Take time with your title, make it catchy without being misleading. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Steemit is not a link farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022Post your own work. &nbsp;Even camera phone photos are better than ones from the net. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022If you post photography make sure you add something that lets people know it is your photo. &nbsp;You don't want people to not upvote it becuase they don't know if it is taken from the internet or not and no one wants to do an image search on every photo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022And finally, don't be an ass. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more of a tip for life in general but hey, it applies here too.</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Have you ever fallen into a pattern of behaviour with a group of people? &nbsp;Maybe you are the one who tells funny stories all the time or you are the one who tells others about the latest gagdets. &nbsp;It may be because you like comedy or love tech and are happy to share your interests. &nbsp;But there is a chance that your behaviour is the result of postive reactions from the previous times you started to do that behviour. &nbsp;If you share an app that no one heard of and everyone starts to use it, maybe it made you feel good. &nbsp;So you tell them about another one and still, another positve result. &nbsp;This carries over to the next week where you let everyone know about this cool new site called Steemit, which leads them to high five you after they make there first dollar. &nbsp;What begins to happen is you start to pay more attention to the tech world. &nbsp;You might go out of your way to look for new things to tell people about. &nbsp;And soon you become an expert who can spot the next thing from a mile away. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is this idea that we tend to like what we are good at. Our interests and hobbies are, in a way, molded by the postive feelings we get from them. &nbsp;And being good at something is quite a positve feeling. &nbsp;Think of the things you enjoy doing. &nbsp;If it is something you put any considerable time into, it was probably because you had a knack for it. It is more likely you will follow a career in a field if you are quick to understand that field and feel like you can excel in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;And a lot of the time, since we are social creatures, excel-at-it is a relative term where other people acknowledge that you are good at it. &nbsp;It can come in the form of applause, laughter, good grades or money, but the external stimulus that you are getting that shows you are good at the thing you are doing is giving by someone else. This is why we need to encourage people and not be discoruaged ourselves when we fail at something. &nbsp;Getting good at anything takes practice. &nbsp;And if you have people giving you positive and realisitic (don't lie to someone if they are really bad at something) support, you might be suprised how far you can impove in a field of your choice. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>But we are not salvidating dogs. We are not animals. &nbsp;All the behaviour tests on animals in the world cannot fully help us to udnerstand huamns. &nbsp;People who like something will do it even if they suck at it and will do so with a smile on there face. &nbsp;And more power to them. &nbsp;Good for them rocking that shower ballad even when they are clearly tone deaf. &nbsp;People are more then how the outside world rewards them. &nbsp;And on top of that we are aware of why we likes things. &nbsp;Take this article for example, I can write about the idea of it because we can look outside of ourselves and see why we are doing what we do. &nbsp;Just something to think about the next time your eye wanders to that new tech article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@funny - follow, promote, vote \")</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/76p03ocmb/pexels_photo_65121_1.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\"/></p>\n<p>(pexels.com)</p>\n</html>",

But if you waste your time with regret of what could have been you are going to miss out on what is coming next. &nbsp;Keep looking forward and keep looking outward. If you are focused on your field it is easy to feel like another opportunity like the one that passed in your field will not happen again in your lifetime. &nbsp;The key is realizing it may not be in your field. &nbsp;It may be something you have never heard of. &nbsp;Take steemit for example. &nbsp;How many people knew nothing of blockchains but learned about it and spotted an opportunity when the site was new and even now as it is still growing? &nbsp;This carries over to everything. There will always be a next big thing and if you are willing to widen your scope (if only for investment purposes) you will pick up on more of them. &nbsp;It takes a little more work then when it is something that is in your scope of expertise, but taking some time to spot an opportunity while still staying in your field can help you build the capitial you need to continue to pursue your field of choice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Remeber you didn't actually lose anything. I know me telling you this is probably not helping, but it is true. &nbsp;Losing an opportunity is not the same as losing something you actually have. &nbsp;If you knew about the opportunity after the fact, knew about it before and decided not to do anything or didn't know about it at all, the results are all the same. &nbsp;Technically, even if the opportunity never existsed, you are in the same boat then if it did and you didn't act. &nbsp;What is causing any frustration is the knowing that you have missed out, which means, quite literally, that it is all in your head. &nbsp;There are probably dozens of opportunities you are missing a month that are not even on your radar and you don't loss sleep over an of them (and no, don't start thinking about all those other missed opportunities). &nbsp;The loss of what could have been hits as badly as if we actually had it. &nbsp;It is even something you might feel more suddenly than losing something you actually had. &nbsp;That is because we, as forward thinkers, are visualizing what will be and since that is what is in our head, we feel the lose of possibilites quite instantly. &nbsp;While feeling the loss for something you had may take more time as we tend to take for granted what is in our life. &nbsp;&nbsp;So dust yourself off, raise your head and look forward to the next big thing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/6t2iaz195/woman_dropped_fail_failure.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\"/></p>\n<p>(pexels.com)</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>About ten years ago, maybe five, internet dating got saddled with this idea that if you use it there was something wrong with you. &nbsp;That you were socially awkward and had trouble finding a date in real life. &nbsp;But the same things were said when you were a nerd. &nbsp;It wasn't that long ago that nerds were at the bottom of the popularity chart and now it's almost uncool if you are not one. &nbsp;Things and people change. &nbsp;So @funny is announcing that internet dating is no longer something to scoff at. &nbsp;Why do I say this? &nbsp;Well here is a list of reasons why internet dating is a legit, and sometimes better, way to meet new people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You Mean You Have A Personality &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you meet someone at a bar or club what are you really basing your decision on. &nbsp;It's simple, you're basing it on looks and looks alone. &nbsp;I'm not going to argue how important looks are, or are are not, in a relationship but I can tell you, if you don't have anything in common, the relationship is going to suffer. &nbsp;There are cases, and this is rare, when you happen to see a tattoo of something the person likes that you like as well, but even if that is the case, basing a relationship on one common interest isn't a solid plan. &nbsp;And yes, you can argue that internet dating is shallow as well, people with hot pictures are the ones getting more messages. &nbsp;But under that picture is a bio and depending on the site, other information about the person beside how they look in a swimsuit. &nbsp;It may not be a lot but it is something. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Get To Know The Person First &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you flash a smile at a club and the person comes over. &nbsp;You try to make funny banter in their ear but they can't hear a word you're saying. &nbsp;But they think you're cute, so they smile and start to dance with you. &nbsp;Maybe you end up exchanging numbers or a kiss in the corner of the club. &nbsp;That is great, but what did you really learn about the person. &nbsp;I have had times, and yes I am embarrased to admit this, where I wasn't even sure of the woman's name when I called her. &nbsp;Needless to say that relationship didn't work out. &nbsp;But when you meet someone online you have to converse with them. &nbsp;There has to be some kind of back and forth before a meetup is agreed upon. &nbsp;For some people it a quick hey let's meet for coffee and others it may be months of late night conversations, but either way the option to really talk is presented in every case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Less Pressure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's easier, in a way, to be yourself on the net. &nbsp;You can tell people things about yourself that you would have trouble saying in person. &nbsp;There is no fear of what the other person will say or how they will look at you and once you are comfortable that this person likes the real you then you can decide to meet. &nbsp;And there is the added benefit of being able to end the conversation anytime without any awkwardness. &nbsp;It can take months to tell someone things about you that you can spill out online in an conversation and see how they react. &nbsp;And if the getting to know the person doesn't work out, you can send a friendly goodbye message and move on to someone else. &nbsp;No need to have to wait until the date is over as you look at the clock every five minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I Don't Have The Time To Meet People &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That isn't just an excuse. &nbsp;People are busy and dating takes time. &nbsp;Meeting people even takes time. &nbsp;When you go out to a club or bar, you have to get ready, get there and spend, who knows how long, trying to make eye contact, or 'bump into', someone who wants to be 'bumped into' by you. &nbsp;That is if the person even wants to be bothered to chat. &nbsp;There are people who go to clubs because they want to dance or unwind and they don't want to be bothered by some one who is looking for a date. &nbsp;Plus it gets expensive. &nbsp;There are cover charges, costs of transport, drinks. &nbsp;And if you do meet someone you can only get to know them so much in the bar, so that means going on a date, which costs more money. &nbsp;It adds up, especially when you are meeting a lot of people who are not right for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm Shy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with being shy. &nbsp;Some people need time before they are comfortable putting themselves out there. &nbsp;Who cares. &nbsp;You are worth it and you want to find someone who knows that. &nbsp;And maybe you are a bit \"weird\" by some people's standards. &nbsp;Again, who cares. &nbsp;Okay techincally this doesn't argue agianst being socially awkward. &nbsp;But if you are, so what, good for you. &nbsp;We all have our quirks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now I know there are negatives. &nbsp;There are people who are not who they say are and times when you meet someone online that you click with over the net but don't seem to gel with when you meet up in person. &nbsp;It is not perfect. &nbsp;And yeah there are benefits to meeting people in person rather than online. But that does not take away from the benefits that online dating has. &nbsp;It is an option, a very viable one, of meeting people and you, if you choose to use it, should not feel lesser for doing so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/nv066jnj3/smartphone_friends_internet_connection.jpg\" width=\"630\" height=\"380\"/></p>\n<p>(pexels.com) &nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you are starting to meet new people, now what? &nbsp;I'm not going to lie to you. &nbsp;I'm not going to tell you that all you have to do is be yourself and everyone will be interested in you. &nbsp;That phone numbers will fall at your feet and your social calender will run out of space. Cause it won't. &nbsp;In reality, being yourself probably won't attract as many dates as you possibly could get. But getting a higher number of yeses shouldn't be your goal, especially if you are looking for a long-term serious relationship. &nbsp;What you want is to find that one person, the one who is going to be there for the real you. &nbsp;That one who knows who you are on your good days and your bad and will still stick it out for you when you are at your worse. &nbsp;If you waste all your time impressing the wrong people, you might miss your chance with the right ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I was younger and didn't know better, I had made mistakes of acting in a way that I thought the person I liked wanted me to act like. &nbsp;And I have seen times when others have done it for me. &nbsp;We have all been there. &nbsp;Maybe its something small, like you pretend to like a band that you would never listen to, or something bigger, like pretending your an outdoors person when really all you want to do is stay home on a Saturday night in your pajamas. &nbsp;And this can work at first. &nbsp;If you are good enough at understanding what the other person likes, and wants, you can give it to them. &nbsp;But how long can you do it before it becomes a chore? &nbsp;When you start to act \"differently\" because you start to voice what you really think. &nbsp;At some point the person who you are will start to surface. &nbsp;Or worse it won't and that pushed down resentment can lead to some bad moods and arguements down the line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So give it a try. &nbsp;You are going to meet a lot of people that you will not, in one way or another, click with. &nbsp;That is just fine. &nbsp;So is being rejected. &nbsp;It does not feel great when it happens, but it happens. &nbsp;You are no worse off then before you got rejected. &nbsp;And who knows how much time you would have wasted chasing the wrong person. &nbsp;Be smart about your time and just be yourself.</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>I will admit, I was one of those kids who was not a fan of gym. You know the ones. The ones that hope the three outs pass before the ball makes it to the outfield. Come on strike-out! I like to hit the ball, but the whole catching and throwing thing was not for me. I couldn't kick in soccer and apparently you need something called co-ordination for tennis. Basketball required dribbling, so that was out and football was a time to chill on the bench. I never played rugby but I'm sure I would suck at it. Golf is a no unless it is mini. Surfing involves balance and I would sink like a stone at the first wave. Skateboarding lead to ripped pants and scrapped knees. I was not winning an olympic medal when we did our track and field events in school. Hockey, ha! I was happy if I didn't fall on my ass when I was skating. I was not bad at bowling, so that is something. The point is (if there is a point) is if you did suck at sports, you are not alone. I wanted to be on the bench with a pad and a pencil drawing. So if you are or were like me, don't sweat it, find your own ways to stay in shape, eat right and embarce your lack of strength, speed and co-ordination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/z2zqr8c73/black_and_white_sport_fight_boxer.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"465\"/></p>\n</html>",

      "body": "![Image of frame](https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/0*Eauz_8nD2ncyQTzP.jpg)\n\nGiven how fast events in the Indo-Pacific seem to be evolving in 2016, it\u2019s tempting to regard 2006 as ancient history. But in many ways, 2006 was the beginning of a decade of transition for the region. Along with Twitter, we saw the (re-)launch of martial law inThailand and Fiji. North Korea began its fitful series of nuclear tests. Ban-Ki Moon became the first Asian since U Thant to become Secretary-General of the United Nations, which would shortly intervene in East Timor. It was also the year that the Qinghai-Tibet Railway was first laid down, and of the reopening of the Nathu La Pass between China and India, after decades of confrontation. These last two events can be seen as anticipating China\u2019s OBOR (\u201cOne Belt One Road,\u201d or \u201cNew Silk Road\u201d) initiative to build modern trade infrastructure in South and Central Asia.\n\n2006 was also the year that FLAG, a singular if not entirely successful Anime series depicting modern conflict in the Indo-Pacific region, was released.\n\nFLAG tells the story of UN intervention against sectarian violence in a fictional Himalayan South Asian state literally though the viewfinder of a young Japanese photojournalist. When we say though the viewfinder, we mean it\u200a\u2014\u200avirtually the entire story is told through the medium of found footage.\n\nThis modern take on the epistolary narrative is a hallmark of the series, but in some ways, along with a plot which many regarded as too dependent upon dialogue over action and yet at the same time undeveloped, seems to have limited its appeal, particularly for Western/Weeaboo audiences attracted to the medium mainly for sci-fi action, kawaii, and surreal gore. A primary plot device is a defaced UN flag, which becomes both the symbol of the nation\u2019s hopes for peace as well as a somewhat facile MacGuffin for the military action in the series. One reviewer wrote, \u201cFLAG is the type of work that can only be done once. Once you see an anime presented as a documentary about war journalism, that idea is going to have to sit fallow at least a decade before it is re-used.\u201d It is perhaps by this process that we have come to rediscover the series in 2016.\n\nDespite its flaws, FLAG is a must watch, whether your interest is in Anime generally or in the continuum of war and peace in Asia. The animation is technically brilliant, and the drama is compelling once you set aside disbelief in the flag as plot catalyst as well as some of the more precious portrayals of culture. The fact that it depicts conflict in a region and with people where many audiences might still not expect it\u200a\u2014\u200adespite the Long War in Afghanistan, political turmoil in Nepal, the rise of reactionary Buddhism in Myanmar and Thailand, and the ongoing intrigue over OBOR\u200a\u2014\u200amakes it especially worth looking at now.\n\nIf you can find it.\n\n(Originally published at https://www.indopacificmonitor.com on 29 July 2016.)",

      "body": "After 18 years in the US military, the wife and I decided it was time to retire.  Having the freedom to choose your next path in life seemed daunting.  We knew we did not want to settle down into the life of commuting on I-95 for two hours a day with some government contractor or another.  Other than that we had no other ideas of what to do. Sitting down at the dinner table one day with the father-in-law helped bring something into focus. He said, \u201cWell if you are not sure what to do when you get out, why don\u2019t you just buy an RV and drive around the country for a year?\u201d The wife and I stared at each other as if we were retarded because we didn't think of that idea ourselves.  so we did just that.\n\nIn May 2013 we started on the road full time with our four girls.  After 18 months we found ourselves with four girls, one boy, and one way plane tickets to Thailand.  Now we find ourselves living with our family of seven on Java learning a new culture and a new language.  In a few months I will be starting a business finding international markets for locally grown products here.  I hope to keep you updated on how our journey transpired and how you may be able to do the same.",

While they have been established in different respective areas from small communities, towns, cities, provinces up to the whole societies such as States for how many decades, they have also been fought for, defended, and died for by their supporters.

Visitors from around the world, mostly the Westerners who travel very far to east just to reach the country, always bring big smiles on their faces as they are on their way home. Aside from the beautiful places available for them to visit, one thing they can never forget while in the Philippines --the cultures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Filipinos' Hospitability</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One common visible attitude of the Filipinos regardless of their ethnic differences and embraced local cultures is their hospitability. Filipinos even treat a stranger good. Despite the calamities, financial crises, family conflicts, job loss, and any other problems the Filipinos usually encounter, they can still manage to entertain their neighbors, friends, and other acquaintances as if nothing bad has happened to them. There is no doubt about why the overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) are in demand abroad because they can be good assets to the foreign businesses such as restaurants being waiters and waitresses, big companies being clerks, and they are even good as domestic helpers because of their unique comforting treatments towards their patients outside the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>High respect especially to elders</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The sayings 'po' and 'opo' when talking to different people especially to elders, whether Filipinos or non-Filipinos, are just ones of the manifestations that the Filipinos pay a high respect towards other people. This culture has been maintained by the native Filipinos and has successfully been transmitted to the young generation. With the help of the churches, this has been strengthened as a moral standard among the Filipinos. Failure to respect others is subject to certain punishment on the side of the mothers in the families with the purpose of educating the kids so that they will also pass it to the future generation. Bowing heads is also a way of respecting the elders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>The Fiesta</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This term was originally Spanish in nature which means celebration or festival. This had been enculturated to the native Filipinos by the Spaniards during the Spanish colonization from the year 1565 to 1898 (333 years) and has continued to exist until today. This is a Catholic religious festival that gives tribute to Saints annually. This has been nationalized in the Philippines by the Spaniards during their era when they were still manipulating the Philippine government under the monarchial rule of the king in Spain. The Catholic religion was the official religion of the country that time under the ordinance of the king. Since then, the religious fiesta became an obligation for the Filipinos to be celebrated once a year. Presently, every <em>barangay </em>(small town), municipality, and city has its own fiesta differing in the day of celebration. In fact, it is one of the most joyful and awaited celebration as it only happens once a year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is a food gathering and different fruit festival together with some street dancing representing the statues of the Saints which are being celebrated during the anniversary. For some Filipinos, it is also their family gathering as it is their tradition to come home together from their professions in the outside for at least the whole day. Filipino migrants usually leave their jobs for awhile just to attend to the fiesta in their hometowns. There are also circumstances that some neighborhood conflicts are resolved during the celebration because one feature also of the fiesta is avoiding troubles while being celebrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What amazes also the foreigners during the fiesta is their friendly treatment to the strangers that they invite them to the dinner. The more people enjoying on the table full of food, the more merrier for them. They do not care of the expenses they spend for the annual holiday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bWC4JIC16fpFyXU3MUcoECfL6Te7_WzL3vIdSWAZJYsG0qVW5yt-70bnbchHU6uQ6rVJ-GsOFGmwrLEut-t9DW-Z2_g3umdynjXzjUabNLEW1ngs7GgkeialiaTlPM97-l66DZKbR71ilo8AiWWW5eYa5bUSVb6p5WWor3-yz7q6LwJ1m6dXJWdD3v8oel2e5roA7GWs7Xo46UrcgdEPxeRtUBv42gQwpIvi2c67hoVCzaqLH3hNZGc0pUjB1uDPJCYb1stRH0iyDpCOcuf8vqTDWKUek1m0WkNRv_kjsAfQYrM-e8YFtoYzmbFPQYPeQOJbmyshXY1yKth9YL4o1XQv2A5Bhr65dwGsGsHDjFZlsnDa6dyyaxn_tyMQdI7q2w460ThUjiXhxbeY6_IoTBPQVlMFAfi6NpUnAVwsNJldLizJMWfYcOlKOkbeTx-m803r6AmRdIZnLmKVDhx5m3mnWyll2Jmzhw_eJSJi-PCjq_gd0MroRVpA_3dzlp6yrLbefFlbF0bYUCF1WaP8ajhKNmOcDLYPuvlRLenQFoBxzWrMIFnM0hv0Dqe_jOrDWMsWAHHjH9OZMJnWIrtSL4Ekamb7sHfu8RoQr44vJLT1CWc=w600-h322-no\" width=\"600\" height=\"322\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://topfamousquotes.com\">[ImageCredit]</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Filipinos' Optimism</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Philippines has always been struck by typhoons that caused extreme flooding, earthquakes as it is in the pacific ring of fire, and threatened by terrorism. Poverty is also one of the country's social issues. Fortunately, the Filipino people have never lost hope for a good tomorrow. They can easily recover from tragedies. One can never compare a Filipino child who was once lost parents due to typhoon <em>Sendong </em>that hit <em>Visayas </em>and some part of Mindanao regions in the country in December, 2011 and yet stands to continue life once more and moves on from the past. This quality of theirs really inspires other nations mostly those who were also victims of the same catastrophes. Foreigners have always proudly brought this to their countries. Hopefulness is forever in one's heart of a Filipino wherever he/she goes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Philippines should be a great source of inspiration, a model of good manners and right conduct and unity. Indeed, there are more impressive qualities of the Filipinos you can explore as you visit the country. As you try to visit the museums, you can see the historical background being portrayed in the form of any artistic creations, the essence of the patriotism through revolutions, and values contributed by the great fathers and the country's national heroes in the past to the current cultural system in the country. You cannot just imagine a Third World small country where temperature is very high can be greater than the other big States when it comes to values and richness in culture. Despite its economic inferiority over the others, it has stood firm to survive and produced good citizenry. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n---------\n\n<b>Attention: This post has been written by @ellamaeamor</b>\n\n@knozaki2015 features authors and artist to promote them and a diversity of content. https://steemit.chat/channel/academy (if you want to get in touch)\n\nThe author will receive 100% of the STEEM Dollars from this post\n\nDon't just follow me, follow the author as well, if you like their post @ellamaeamor\n</html>",

      "body": "Hello everyone, I am coming back with the second part of my Berlin food trip. I hope you enjoyed the first part of the journey, and for some of you who have been asking for the next one, here it is :) \n\n![enter image description here](https://s4.postimg.io/dxuba0amj/image.jpg)\n*Sachiko Sushi's famous sashimi dish*\n\n**SACHIKO SUSHI**\nI love Japanese food, I really do. And so does my hubby. He can eat sushi everyday and even every meal. Therefore, we decided to have Japanese food for lunch. Surprisingly, there are several places offering Japanese dishes in Berlin, and it was such a challenge choosing which one to visit. Eventually, we went to Sachiko Sushi in Grolman street. This place is quite small and cozy, not so many tables but the special thing is they have a really nice \u201csushi river\u201d in the middle of the room:\n\n![Sushi on boat](https://s4.postimg.io/bf8m9bowb/image.jpg)\n*Sushi on boats :P*\n![Sushi on boats](https://s4.postimg.io/d4hphe4ln/image.jpg)\n*It got empty quite quickly (not from us, of course)*\n\nSushi dishes are put on top of the boats and the sushi boats go along the river. Customers can easily take their favorite one directly from the boats. It is a fun experience eating like that. The sushi river along with soft music at the restaurant has brought a relaxing feeling to people. The sushi here are quite nice, we ordered some original dishes and some fusion ones. \n\n\n![enter image description here](https://s4.postimg.io/lf3ip805n/image.jpg)\n\n![enter image description here](https://s4.postimg.io/za1t7oukr/image.jpg)\n*Some nice mixed maki roll*\n\nUnfortunately, Sachiko sushi only offers sushi and some side dishes such as tempura, gyoza and Japanese chicken nuggets. There is no udon, ramen or rice, which made me a little upset :( this restaurant is worth trying once you are a fan of sushi. \n\n**FROZEN YOGURT**\n![enter image description here](https://s4.postimg.io/tae2419sb/image.jpg)\nYummy is all I can say about this dessert. There are different yogurt flavors: original, strawberry, mango and caramel. I chose the medium size with 4 toppings. It is fun selecting the toppings since there are several kinds such as fresh fruit, cookies, nut, chocolate sauce etc. My cup turned out to be toooo much, a big one full of toppings. But it looked sooo attracting and eventually I finished the whole cup by myself :) \n\n**MATCHA LATTE \u2013 COME BUY BUBBLE TEA**\nWe ran into this beautiful tea shop on a street at the heart of the city. Unlike the Coco Tea shop yesterday, this place offers a wider range of tea,  more traditional and typical Taiwanese. I just love the d\u00e9cor with nature style. They even have a bookshelf with many Asian comic books. I was extremely happy when I saw \u201cMatcha\u201d on the menu. Although Matcha drinks are popular in Asian, here in Germany they become pretty rare as Western people seem to be not so interested in this flavor. For me, I like the bitterness of Matcha and the aroma rising from it. Undoubtedly, I had to order a cup of Matcha milk tea with pearls right away. And I was not disappointed. The matcha is so refreshing, strong and aromatic \u2013 another must-try when you are in Berlin ;)\n![enter image description here](https://s4.postimg.io/udy6fzuff/8_2.jpg)\n*Comebuy shop from the outside (Credits: pic from google)*\n![enter image description here](https://s4.postimg.io/akm2nah1n/image.jpg)\n*And the inside (Credits: pic from google)*\n![enter image description here](https://s4.postimg.io/p535i4c0b/image.jpg)\n*We took 3 cups of these delicious* \n\n**VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT- DONG XUAN MARKET** \nDong Xuan market is an ideal place for Vietnamese cuisine lover like me. Beside Asian mini supermarkets and shops, there are many restaurants there offering authentic Vietnamese dishes. Nowhere else in Berlin could you find the full menu of Vietnamese foods including even the rare ones. With recommendation from a friend, we stopped by Hanoi Quan and had a beautiful dinner there. \n![Bun cha](https://s4.postimg.io/3wu2efmx7/image.jpg)\n*The famous Bun Cha \u2013 a Hanoian specialty : noodle soup with pork BBQ and dipping sauce.* \n\nYummy !!! I love how they put everything into a bamboo dish, very attracting ;) By the way, you can read more about [Bun Cha here](https://steemit.com/food/@mibenkito/my-second-journey-to-the-exotic-land-of-asian-cuisine-obama-s-bun-cha).\n\n![Pho Ga](https://s4.postimg.io/fzze1zxzf/image.jpg)\n*One of the most popular and well-known meal in Vietnam: Ph\u1edf (This one is chicken style noodle soup - Pho Ga).* \nRead more about [Pho here](https://steemit.com/food/@mibenkito/welcome-to-the-exotic-travel-of-asian-foods-first-entry-pho-a-bow-of-heaven).\n![Banh Cuon](https://s4.postimg.io/qpd2u99sb/image.jpg)\n*Banh Cuon*\nBanh Cuon in short is Vietnamese steamed rice cakes, inside is minced pork with special type of mushroom, you eat them with a dipping sauce, somehow similar to Bun Cha\u2019s sauce :) \n\n![Nom](https://s4.postimg.io/768hkwb0r/image.jpg)\nChicken legs salad - my most favorite dish of the meal. The chiken legs without bones are mixed with some Vietnamese vegetables, fresh herbs, sweet and sour dressing. I am starving typing this line. The crunchiness of the legs and the sweet and sour flavors of the dressing make a great combination. I just could not help it, so I decided to ask for one more dish to take away :) \n\nIt was such an awesome dinner that we had at Dong Xuan market. I could not eat the Vietnamese dessert since I was too full. What a pity ! But I will come back here soon, I promise ;) That is also the end of my short food trip in Berlin. Although it was only 2 days, I realized that I had eaten toooo much after composing these entries. There is no doubt that my weight will be a big problem here, but who cares ? Good food, happy life \u2013 that is my slogan :P \nThank you so much for reading my food entries, I will try to come up with more interesting posts later. \n***See you soon <3<3<3***",

      "body": "Hello Steemians, I am very happy to be back on Steemit and continue my never-ending stories about food. I had written about food in Berlin for the last two entries, you can see them [here](https://steemit.com/food/@mibenkito/a-steemian-s-world-food-journal-berlin-part-2). And now is time to start a brand new journey, to a very old but adorable city of the Mediterranean time: **ROME**. \n\nAs you know, Rome is famous for its amazing architectures such as Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, etc. There are just too many interesting places that you have to visit in this wonderful city. But, how about the cuisine? To talk about Italian cuisine in general, pizza and pasta are seemed to be the most two popular dishes. Notwithstanding, the food in Rome is more than that. There are several yummy eating places with different types of food there, and I\u2019d love to tell you about some of them on this post. Let\u2019s get it started now!!!\n\n[![IMG_1825.jpg](https://s9.postimg.io/omw80eakf/IMG_1825.jpg)](https://postimg.io/image/i974x55ob/)\n\n**HANG ZHOU CHINESE RESTAURANT**\nVia Airbnb, we booked a nice apartment in Miucino. The host was very friendly and helpful, he introduced this restaurant to us. It is near our apartment, just 5 minutes walking. After a long, tired day of traveling by foot, we visited the restaurant with hungry stomachs and weary feet. The menu is pretty popular with various Chinese dishes of all kinds. The demonstrating pictures made me hungrier and I decided to order the food by pointing at some photos. It did not take a long for the foods to be done and we were served quickly. I did not know if it was because we were starving or the food was too yummy, but we finished them in 15 minutes. Luckily I remembered to take some pictures: \n\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/tgihxkvkj/image.jpg)\n**The stirred black rice with shrimps and shallot** \u2013 I have tried black rice many times but never with this style. Normally I eat steamed black rice with yogurt (it is a southeast asia typical dessert), however it tastes interestingly when it is stirred, although it is a little bit chewy and hard. \nOn the left is the famous Chinese Xiu Mai with shrimps and pork mince, not the best Xiu Mai I have eaten but it is not bad at all ;)\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/x1edgt045/image.jpg)\n**Deep-fried duck with orange sauce** - we love this dish <3 The duck is quite crunchy, the sweet and sour orange sauce combined with the duck creates a delicious taste that makes us want to eat more. \nThere are three other dishes that we ate, however forgive my hungriness, it was too late before I realized that I need to take some photos (it is one of my hobbies as well). However, it is not too difficult for me to find some pictures from the internet, since this restaurant is quite well-known in Rome: \n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/ko1j9wafp/image.jpg)\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/t7kx7nis5/image.jpg)\nThe price was not expensive at all, only 60-70 euro for a dinner of 4 people. The food is delicious and the dishes are big enough for all of us. With a very full stomach, I was more than happy to give some tips for the waitress and told him that we will definitely come back next time. \n\n**Palazzo del Freddo Giovanni Fassi \u2013 Most famous Ice Cream shop in Rome** \nNear the Hang Zhou restaurant is a large ice cream shop with an attracting aroma catching attention of passengers every time they walk by. How could I resist this sweet seduction? There are a lot of customers there in the shop, some were enjoying their ice cream and some were queuing in a long line to order their treat. \n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/f3p1z9bkl/image.jpg)\n*Customers in front of the ice cream booth*\n\nInterestingly, there is not only ice cream but also several kinds of dessert here: the famous tiramisu, waffle with ice cream, crepe, ice cream cakes, fresh chocolate etc. All look extremely yummy, I wish I could try them all :P After 5 minutes of waiting in the line, we decided to order tiramisu, chocolate ice cream cake and some ice cream flavors. All of the ice cream here are freshly made. There are so many flavors but I chose chocolate, caramel and vanilla. The shop has a signature sauce to put on top of the ice cream, and it was the best part. I can tell it was made of fresh milk, whipping cream, sugar and there might be other things that create a unique taste that I would never forget. I bought the medium size cone and it turned out to be really hugeee. But no worry, since it was super tasty, I finished it right away. The tiramisu and ice cream cake were also pretty good. \n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/es7lmhv4l/image.jpg)\n**Ice cream cakes  in the fridge**\n\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/lwpevj2dx/image.jpg)\n**Fresh chocolate with different flavors: lemon, dark chocolate, milk chocolate**\n\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/ll7yirlxx/image.jpg)\n**Our treat**\n\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/wm7p1j3kl/image.jpg)\n**The hugest ice cream cone in my life**\n\nAnd believe it or not, we bought 2 cakes, 2 cone and 1 cup for just aroud 10 euro. It was surprisingly cheap, too cheap for the quality and quantity that they had given. I love this ice cream shop,it is one of the best ice cream in my life so far. If you plan to visit Rome, this place is a must :) \n\n**TEMAKINHO ROME BORGO \u2013 JAPANESE FUSION RESTAURANT**\nTemakinho is a small restaurant around 10 minutes walking from Venice square. We found it from Trip advisor with pretty high ranking in the Japanese category. What makes us curious about this restaurant is that they create their own style of sushi by combining Japanese, Brazilian and South American cuisines. The d\u00e9cor is so cool with Brazilian style, which is unlike typical Japanese eating places.\n![enter image description here](http://www.temakinho.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/32.jpeg)\n*Inside temakinho - Credits to temakinho.com*\n\nLooking at the menu, we were a little bit lost since all the dishes sound pretty strange. I had never seen  them before. Therefore, a friendly waiter came to explain the menu and helped us with our order. And wowww, please have a look at what we tried: \n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/86zh0h4np/image.jpg)\nThis beautifully decorated dish is raw fishes salad \u2013 salmon, salmon roe and tuna with the restaurant\u2019s special sauce. The fishes are fresh, the sauce is somehow similar to teriyaki sauce. I just love how they decorated it, such a piece of art work.\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/a02dospud/image.jpg)\nGrilled seafood (king crab, prawn, octopus, scallop) eating with deep-fried slices of potatoes, honey mustard sauce. Another beautiful dish and the taste is not bad at all. The seafood is properly grilled, the potato slices are crunchy. Nice combination!\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/g2a0faead/image.jpg)\nAnd here it is, the main dish: sushi in fusion style. We ordered 4 types of maki rolls. The ones with soft shell crab and grilled salmon with creamcheese are my two favorite. These sushi rolls are surprisingly good, the rice is soft, sticky and other ingredients are fresh. 8/10 scores for this sushi dish from me.\nThe minor point of this restaurant might be the price, since it is not cheap. We spent over 100 euro for the meal. However for all the \u201cfusion invention\u201d and super lovely food decoration, I think they deserve it. This restaurant is another must in Rome if you like sushi. By the way, it's a little bit hard to find the restaurant since it locates in a very narrow street with a lot of others cusine restaurants. Make sure you find the right one ;).\n\n**RISTORANTE LA TEVERNA ROMA \u2013 ITALIAN RESTAURANT**\nThe final destination I want to show you guys is La Teverna, an Italian restaurant. It will be a big mistake ignoring Italian food when you are in Rome. With the recommendation of our Airbnb host, we came to this restaurant for lunch. Besides pizza, pasta, we ordered mussels and a combined dish of grilled seafood. It took quite a long time for the dishes to be served, notwithstanding it was worth the wait. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/cwpep2vo5/image.jpg)\n**Steamed mussels in garlic butter sauce**. \nMussel is one of my most favorite seafood dishes, therefore I have tried it in many different places but this mussel dish had totally got me. The mussels are big and soft (in some other places they are quite chewy), the sauce is nicely balanced. I can finish the whole dish on my own :D\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/z9x5bvwlx/image.jpg)\n*Pasta bolognese \u2013 the typical Italian pasta*. The taste is okay, there is nothing special about this dish :(\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/80lrxdvit/image.jpg) \n*A big pizza with mushroom, salami*. My sister ordered it and I just tried one piece (I am not a fan of pizza, to be honest). The pizza was freshly baked, hot and crunchy.\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/qu7kudtqt/image.jpg)\n**Seafood pasta** - I do not remember the Italian name of this dish, however it is quite tasty. The seafood is cooked in tomato sauce and wine, the mussels are extremely good.\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/hnpa73oid/image.jpg)\n**The grilled seafood dish**: this dish is huge, a small lobster, a thick slice of salmon, prawns, squid and sea-bass. They are all marinated and properly grilled. I love the prawns with a lot of eggs inside, the lobster meat is sweet and fresh too.\n\nTo sum up, the restaurant is quite nice. I will go for seafood dishes if I visit it next time. The mussels there are too good. However, the pasta and pizza are just okay. The price is reasonable, approximate 100 euro for a meal of 5 people (with really big stomachs lol). \n\nThat is the end of my food report about Rome. It was such a pity I did not have enough time to try other places, but I am quite satisfied with what I have eaten here. I Rome you can find really nice Japanese fusion dishes, fantastic ice cream, yummy Chinese restaurants and of course, one of the best Italian food. I hope to come back to this amazing city again, and if I can, there will definitely be another part of my Rome food journal on Steemit ^^ \n*Ciao !!!!!*\n\n*PS: Bonus pic - Me and the Colosseum <3<3<3*\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.io/mnmqf1u4z/image.jpg)",

      "body": "Hello Steemians, the food reporter is back with her trip to one of the most interesting cities in Asia: HONG KONG. I have been to Hongkong several times but can never get enough of this city. To mention Hong Kong, you can think of a sleepless city that is always crowded with people, great shopping with good deals, and especially amazing food. And now, let\u2019s discover Hong Kong cuisine together ;)\n\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/jvf2nuxev/1_3.jpg)\n\n**ONE DIM SUM \u2013 MICHELIN STAR DIM SUM RESTAURANT**\nThis well-known restaurant is awarded 1 Michelin star and that is why I have to visit it. The place is quite small and there are so many customers were waiting to be seated. It took us 30 minutes to get into the restaurant. Looking at the menu, I was really surprised since the price here was quite cheap (actually I thought that all of the restaurants with Michelin star would be expensive :P). \n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/50qh9ontz/image.jpg)\n*Outside the restaurant- there is always a long queue no matter when :)*\n\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/h3vsx8yw7/image.jpg)\n*The menu (picture from thatfoodcray.com)*\n\nThere are several dishes in One Dim Sum, from the typical dim sum styles to the restaurant\u2019s signature foods. I just wanted to order the whole menu since everything looked so yummy. We tried Xiu Mai with pork mince and shrimps, Ha Cao with shrimps, steamed chicken legs with Chinese sauce, steamed  roll with barbeque pork and so many other things. Xiu Mai and chicken legs were too good and we had to order one more of each.\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/x3eggsuxz/4_2.jpg)\n**Our treat :P**\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/cxayhwzaf/image.jpg)\n**Xiu Mai (on the left)**\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/rujfixciv/image.jpg)\n**Fried xiu mai with shrimps inside and steamed roll cake with shrimps**\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/avah3o1bb/7_3.jpg)\n*Steamed meatballs in special sauce (picture from thatfoodcray.com)*\n\n**Nothing here was okay, they were beyond the delicious level**. And I understood why they deserved the Michelin star. As a big fan of Dim Sum, I have tried many dim sum places throughout the world, but it was the one that impressed me the most. With a really cheap price and high quality of food, this place is a must-try that every \u201cDim-Sumholic\u201d need to visit (although you will have to wait for such a long time to have a table, it might be the only minus point in this circumstance :P)\n\n**DESSERTS IN HABOUR CITY**\nAfter a long day of shopping, we found a nice food court on the 5th floor of Habour city, a shopping center on Canton Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui. There were many food stalls with different choices from Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Korean to Vietnam cuisine, but we decided to have desserts since it was pretty early for dinner and here was our order:\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/5l5icdh2f/image.jpg)\nThese lovely bowls were not only eye-catching but also extremely good. Fresh fruits, matcha ice cream, coconut sweet sauce, black beans, jelly\u2026 everything was mixed together created a yummy taste. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/4wwntficn/9_2.jpg)\nThat time was Xmas season, thus ice-cream was made with Xmas style. Look how cute they are, and I cannot eat these ice creams since they are too lovely. However the price was not cheap, 6-7 euro for one :(\n\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/a9li7k693/10_2.jpg)\nEgg pudding with durian sauce: The egg pudding is similar to flan pudding, however blander and is put inside a coconut. The combination of pudding and durian creates a unique flavor, the aromatic smell of durian and egg make us want to order one more.\n\n**BEEF INTESTINE - HONG KONG FAMOUS FOOD STREET**\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/uidh70uxz/image.jpg)\n\nWalking on Hong Kong crowded streets, you can see and smell this famous food everywhere. Some people will not stand the smell of it (my hubby for example, he thinks that it stinks :D), but once you give it a try, trust me, you will be addicted (just like me). Braised beef offal is cooked in a big pot, with white radish and special spices for a long time, hence everything is so soft and well marinated. I go to the food stall in Mong Kok to eat this special dish every time I visit Hong Kong, without it my trip will be totally incomplete. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/oipq3da5j/image.jpg)\nThe braised beef intestine stalls are always crowded with customers like this \n\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/6h6l5kg4n/image.jpg)\nA bowl of beef offal noodle soup\n\n**YAGURA- JAPANESE RESTAURANT \u2013 YAU MA TEI**\nYagura is the best Japanese restaurant in Yau Ma Tei area \u2013 according to Trip Advisor. The first thing to say about this restaurant: it was quite expensive, and the second thing: they offer truly tasty Japanese dishes that makes us forget about the price :D Here is what we ate:\n\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/mgp8p4c6f/image.jpg)\n**Deluxe shasimi plate**: salmon, tuna, prawn, sea urchin, red snapper and red clam- freshly sweet and heavenly taste. The wasabi and ginger are also very good too.\n\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/bidz6xnl3/image.jpg)\nMaki rolls with wagyu beef and foie gras- the most expensive sushi in my life so far, but they are totally worth it!!!\n\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/b6wiu6753/image.jpg)\nMixed grill dish with beef tongue, chicken, shrimps, mushroom, Japanese fish balls, pork etc. I love the beef tongue, crunchy and well-marinated. After that I had to order two more grilled beef tongue skewers. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s18.postimg.io/wulh4m7jb/image.jpg)\nMaki rolls with eel and salmon roe.\n\nThere are still many yummy food in Hong Kong, above are just some of my recommendations when you visit the city. If you are a foodholic, Hong Kong will never let you down, trust me. ^^ \n\nThank for reading and see you in our next destination <3<3<3",

Our names are Sam and Catherine. We are 16 years old, brother and sister, and have an immense passion for traveling.\u00a0Two years ago we ventured out of The United States for the first time on a week long trip to London and Paris and our wanderlust began. Since then we\u2019ve been fortunate enough to go to Italy and Thailand and have just recently returned from a 6 week trip throughout Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia.\u00a0\n\nWe are creating this blog  share our travel adventures. Our mom (@fairytalelife) turned us on to this site the day we got back from our most recent excursion. A few days later we\u2019ve already decided to begin logging our stories and memories from our travels.\n\n![](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/17/IMG_639781fcf.jpg)![](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/17/image16fedf.jpg)\n\n## Sam\n\nI, Sam, have always had a deep interest in photography. Starting from a young age our father would take us on road-trips throughout the US to national parks from coast to coast. One of the main interests for me on these trips was filling up the memory card on my small digital camera from Target (bought with years worth of saved up tooth fairy money).\u00a0 My love for reading and writing has also been a constant in my life, so in seventh grade, when a journalism class was offered I immediately signed up and have now been taking journalism classes for four years. Naturally journalism and photography go hand in hand which has led me to pursue a new passion, photojournalism. Hopefully this blog will help me further develop my journalism and photography skills and allow me, along with my sister, to share our works and stories. Last summer our mom texted us asking if we wanted to go to Thailand in two weeks. Frankly, I thought it was a joke. I couldn\u2019t point to Thailand on a map let alone imagine spending a week there, especially on such short notice. But by some stroke of luck we managed to arrange it and off we went. Ever since then traveling has been my biggest passion.\n\n## Cat\n\nI'm Cat. I 've always been intrigued by new ways of life and different cultures. Last year on my first trip to Thailand I was left in awe by the amazing mix of deep-rooted culture and beauty. It was my first time experiencing a non-western culture. Afterwards I realized one week in Thailand was simply not enough. Shortly thereafter Sam and I planned a six-week trip to more of Southeast Asia for this summer. We just returned a few days ago. On this trip we visited Thailand as well as Laos, and Cambodia. When I grow up I want I study communications and anthropology. I\u2019m also interested in linguistics, and I\u2019m currently learning Mandarin. \u00a0Soon I\u2019ll begin my junior year in high school.\n\n![](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/16/image166b19.jpg)\n*Photo of us at The Uttayan Bajiang Falls in the Bolaven Plateau, Laos*\n\n![](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/16/image25181b.jpg)\n*Scaling a rock face in the Bolaven Plateau, Laos*\n\n![](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/16/image4231fc.jpg)\n*Playing with Khmer children in Kompong Cham, Cambodia at the BSDA Aspara Center*\n\nWe look forward to sharing our memories!",

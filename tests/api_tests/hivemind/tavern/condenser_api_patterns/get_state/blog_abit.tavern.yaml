  # Communities not implemented under 5 mln blocks, but some were created by mock mechanism.
  # For these communities some posts were created, therefore an original result is different from original pattern.
  # For these communities for account `abit` were created 2 artificial comments. Permlinks: `anaconda01`, `anaconda02`
  # For mock reblogs there were created some posts as well.

  # Communities not implemented under 5 mln blocks, but some were created by mock mechanism.
  # For these communities some posts were created, therefore an original result is different from original pattern.
  # Earlier: "post_count": 355 Now: "post_count": 358
  # For these communities for account `blocktrades` were created 3 artificial comments. Permlinks: `crocodile01`, `crocodile02`, `crocodile03`

In celebration, I'll make my \"introduce myself\" post!</center></h1>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/IMG_838624fd8.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>INTRO:</strong></p>\n<p>Hi, my name is Sara!</p>\n<p>I've been around the sun 33 times now.</p>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https://steemit.com/yoga/@saramiller/how-to-yoga-a-pose-a-day-down-dog\">yoga</a>, <a href=\"http://www.intothegardenofeden.com/iodine1.html\">iodine</a>, freedom, <a href=\"http://www.epichandmadeknives.com\">Epic Handmade Knives</a>, and Steemit.</p>\n<p>I dislike the global military-industrial complex, corporate monopolies, and former 6th man of the Oklahoma City Thunder James Harden.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>NOTABLE NOTES:</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most influential experiences of my life was my sister's death when we were teenagers. She was a victim of bioterrorism, and it has taken me years to understand what &nbsp;really happened. There was a time when I was consumed by the pain and anger of losing someone important to me. She was my built-in best friend, and when she died I thought I had too--my depression and despair lasted a solid decade.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I went to college then. I studied finance, economics, and chemistry. I thought I would be a dentist. I didn't like it but I had an \"in\", and <em>at least</em> the money was good. I felt trapped with no options. It sucked, and I had no hope.</p>\n<p>It was by the grace of god that I emerged from those depths, a legit answer to my legit prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because of the darkness I have faced and my miraculous awakening, I am determined to LIVE, or die trying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I couldn't stomach another second of selling my precious, limited, irreplaceable life hours, so I stopped pretending I wanted to be a dentist or that money had any real value, and instead began seeking that which makes me happy.</p>\n<p>In that spirit, I found yoga and meditation. I traveled the country; I traveled the world. I lived in Peru for a year, where I played in the Amazon and loved ayahuasca and climbed the Andes. I met old souls and powerful healers. I managed a non-profit called <a href=\"http://healinghousecusco.com/\">Healing House</a>, where I learned ancient healing arts.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/IMG_381487918.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I was invited to lead yoga and healing journeys, so I traveled to India. I stepped in the Ganges and hiked the Himalayas.&nbsp;I practiced vipassana and hung out with the Tibetan Buddhist monks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/IMG_2571db36c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>When I returned to the States from my walkabout, society looked wonky. Spirit is not an honored part of existence in America. Energy is not honored. Counters to Big Pharma's death grip are villified and slandered, despite experiential evidence. Healing is considered quackery. I wasn't inspired by the shallow, complacent lives that surrounded me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I needed something more, and the most sustainable community in Texas came to my attention. I am blessed to now live at the <a href=\"http://www.intothegardenofeden.com\">Garden of Eden</a>, where I am learning the ways of the Jedi in master training with super being <a href=\"http://www.steemit.com/@quinneaker\">Quinn Eaker</a>. His standards are the hope and better way I prayed for, and he inspires me to be my best, most effective self every single day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/IMG_356682c3c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Quinn has established an anomaly within the matrix where there is nothing asked of me but to evolve as a person. I haven't had a job in 4 years. I never have to put on a uniform. I never have to wake up to an alarm. I never have to worry about bills. There's more than enough of everything! There is so much that it is our duty, honor, and privilege to share.&nbsp;I do what I want 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thankfully, what I want to do is change the world, so I fit right in at the Garden of Eden. I devote 12-16 hours a day to dropping knowledge from my broke ass computer, unless I go to wellness shows where I devote 12-16 hours dropping knowledge on real live people. I'm living in the sweet spot where my service aligns with my passion, because what I love to do with my time, energy, and resources is also of great value to my GOE and extended community.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/IMG_67385d4cf.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>I am living proof that healing knows no bounds, and I dedicate towards it every day.</h1>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/IMG_8402a66ff.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"660\"/></center></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>OUTRO:</strong></p>\n<p>My sister's presence in my life drives my passion for TRUTH and justice to this day.&nbsp;I have given my life in service. Paradoxically, it is the most selfish thing I can do, because my passion fires are stoked by building a better world.&nbsp;I bless up and bliss out every day at the <a href=\"http://www.intothegardenofeden.com\">Garden of Eden</a>, thanks to Quinn.

The matter is - if you don't write you don't make any progress.

I also plan to submit continuous updates on Bitnation, along with broader thoughts on the future of Virtual Nations and City States, Blockchain Applications, Virtual Jurisdictions, Cryptoanarchy, and more. I think Steemit is a wonderful way to empower Open Source Software (OSS) movements. But first, I want to give a yearly update on the STATE OF THE NATION: Bitnation</p>\n<p>/ Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, BITNATION Founder and Chief Unicorn</p>\n<p>(Image beneath featuring me and Alexandre Van De Sande in Rio de Janeiro, working on the DBVN protocol)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/11/susanneandalex088fc.jpg\" width=\"1368\" height=\"912\"/></p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p><br>\nBITNATION started July 14th, 2014, when I shared <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16HDB9AABa5rTOVFJj_8VLdOxgMguovLLAMviaTkZ1q4/edit?userstoinvite=fred.mazo@gmail.com,+btc@mundobitcoin.org&amp;pli=1\">this Google document </a>on Facebook, providing an overview of BITNATION\u2019s plan to build the world\u2019s first Blockchain Powered Virtual Nation. Within a few minutes volunteers from around the world gathered on Facebook and Skype and started discussing and promoting the concept.</p>\n<p><br>\nStarting Bitnation was challenging at first, because the concept was untested, and largely unheard of. Initially, the greatest confusion was around the word <em>governance</em>, because many people associated governance with decision making platforms, like democracy applications and other \u2018organizational governance\u2019 applications, rather than governance <em>services, </em>such as jurisdiction, security, etc. Two years on, the landscape is different. We\u2019ve implemented multiple proofs-of-concept (marriage, land titles, birth certificates, IDs, etc), explained the concept thoroughly in media, at meetups, and conferences, and a handful of others have leveraged the idea, and started implementing their own vision of it. The conceptual progress is tangible, but the greatest obstacle remains: mainstream adoption.</p>\n<p><br>\nWith mainstream adoption in mind, we spent over six month doing market research on what type of applications were used to conduct business in the fastest growing markets - emerging markets - where our services are needed to most, and in what way they were used. The result spoke loud and clear: smartphone chat applications. From WeChat in China, to WhatsApp in Brazil: everyone was on it, for business as well as pleasure. Hence, the road forward became obvious: we had to ditch the previous Pangea code, and start from scratch again, this time building our Blockchain Jurisdiction with a mobile phone chat interface.<br>\nStaying true to our principles, we had strict requirements: the application would need to be end-to-end encrypted, distributed and pseudonymous. After researching and testing several dozens of different codebases, we found Secure Scuttlebutt (SSBC), and its frontend applications, Patchwork and Patchbay. And thus, we begin Year 2: The Year of Pangea</p>\n<p><br>\n<em>Further Reading:</em></p>\n<p><br>\n<a href=\"https://blog.bitnation.co/what-is-bitnation-the-googlement/\">Pre-Foundational Document</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16HDB9AABa5rTOVFJj_8VLdOxgMguovLLAMviaTkZ1q4/edit\">Founding Document</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r_VqWrKQw07E06XAtMv_cZnFyBZma4PFTBJpM5GuzbA/edit\">Whitepaper</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Constitution\">Constitution</a></p>\n<p><strong><br>\nThe Year in Review</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Highlights of the Past Year:</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>The \u2018Accidental Proof-of-Concept\u2019: Citizens, Embassies, Consulates, Allies and Nations</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nWhile we were preoccupied with building the initial Pangea Proof-of-Concept on the Horizon blockchain, what turned out to be the actual Proof-of-Concept, the <a href=\"https://bitnation.co/\">Bitnation website</a>, emerged more or less accidentally. It started with a discussion about the <a href=\"https://bitnation.co/team-directory/\">Team Page</a> while we were renewing our website. I stated that the conventional hierarchical \u2018team page structure\u2019, with executives, employees and so on wasn\u2019t quite philosophically consistent with our decentralized governance movement. Instead, we should adopt a \u2018no-barriers-to-entry model\u2019 like the Swedish Pirate Party initially embraced, enabling anyone who wanted to be part of the Team to simply join and start contributing, without the need for approval from any kind of formal nor informal authority. Said and done, Amin Rafiee implemented it beautifully.</p>\n<p><br>\nHundreds of people signed up as team members in the next few days, and many of them asked: \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m a Citizen now?\u201d. Rather dumbfounded by the overwhelming request to become a Citizen through signing up on the website, we renamed the page to \u2018Citizen Directory\u2019 instead. And the signups kept on coming\u2026</p>\n<p><br>\nInspired by the instant Citizen signup success, we then added sign up as an Ally, sign up as an Embassy or Consulate, and most recently, sign up your Nation. Then the inevitable question arises: \u201cHow do we know these are real, well intentioned people, rather than spam accounts?\u201d. Someone bumped around the idea of manual vetting and approval, but it was quickly discarded by the community, for being a centralized and non-scalable approach. Instead, we came to consensus to experiment with a basic reputation system, a simplified e-Bay style implementation.</p>\n<p><br>\nAs the website gained more and more traction, a range of services were added, from our <a href=\"https://bitnation.co/notary/\">Public Notary</a>, to <a href=\"https://bitnation.co/education-network-ben/\">Education</a> and <a href=\"https://bitnation.co/citizen-security/\">Security Services</a>. In short, the website became a veritable governance service portal, within just a few months after its public launch in Q3/Q4 2015. At the time of writing, there are approximately 4000 Bitnation Citizens, as well as Embassies, Consulates and Allies spread throughout all continents (with the exception of Antarctica), connecting with the community, and using our governance services.</p>\n<p><br>\nAnd just like that, boom - a centralized and non-encrypted website, far from our puritanical Pangea vision, and devoid of any fancy code to speak of &nbsp;(besides the Blockchain ID and Notary) - became our rather arbitrary Minimum Viable Product (MVP). There it was, and it worked. Our much desired, yet very accidental, proof-of-concept :)</p>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN) on Ethereum</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nOne year ago I estimated it would take Bitnation approximately five years to reach full decentralization. Luckily, I was proven brutally wrong. Thanks to the Ethereum technology, and Ethereum based applications such as Backfeed, the space has evolved exponentially in a surprisingly short time frame. Regardless of what one might think of the now-infamous The DAO - the initial enthusiasm surrounding its rather spectacular launch indicated a clear market desire for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO\u2019s), a moment I had been eagerly awaiting since I started to research and write about DAO\u2019s at end of 2013.</p>\n<p><br>\nEarlier this year, in January, I was in communication with Alexandre Van De Sande, a very talented Ethereum designer and frontend developer. We were both in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro at the time, and we decided to get together in person to launch Bitnation\u2019s organizational structure on the Ethereum blockchain, as a customized version of Ethereum\u2019s MIST Wallet DAO code, the DBVN.</p>\n<p><br>\nKey differences between the DAO and the DBVN protocols are inclusion of the constitution on the blockchain, as well as code that attempts to reflect a more holocratic decision making processes, instead of the more commonly adopted democratic process. In my view, democracy is an outdated form of \u2018coercion by the majority\u2019, and from what we\u2019ve been privileged to observe over the last decade, organizations such as The Pirate Party, The Pirate Bay, Anonymous, Linux and, to some extent, even Bitcoin itself, a holocratic model appears to offer greater degree of personal autonomy.</p>\n<p><br>\nAs with most things blockchain, the DBVN code is in an early experimental phase at this time, our concept is significantly more ambitious than its current implementation. Fundamental to our philosophy, the holocratic elements will need significant improvements -- more specifically; the ability to instantly create \u2018holons\u2019 - autonomous and semi-autonomous groups which remains a part of the \u2018Genesis Nation Holon\u2019 infrastructure. This brings us to our second DBVN Code ambition: a full merger into the Pangea protocol.</p>\n<p><br>\nThe aim of Pangea isn\u2019t merely to be an OSS Blockchain Jurisdiction --- beyond its own dispute resolution services, its intent is to enable groups and individuals to create their own Nations and Holons straight onto the Pangea platform, without the need to fork and modify the source code, or have any coding knowledge whatsoever. We\u2019re in the process of designing the Nation and Holon creation functionality through SSBC/ Patchwork/ Patchbay\u2019s public nodes and chat channel infrastructure.<br>\n</p>\n<p>DBVN Ethereum Address: 0x5aaeb6053f3e94c9b9a09f33669435e7ef1beaed</p>\n<p>Watch the Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9UR7aVlF1A</p>\n<p>Contribute to the Code:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Constitution/blob/master/DBVN.sol</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Constitution/blob/master/profit-share.sol</p>\n<p>Read the first Code Audit, and Patch: https://medium.com/@crypto_nation/report-recursive-call-vulnerability-in-dbvn-sol-471d99e30659#.skrvxtg4i</p>\n<p><br>\nAdditionally, to foster increased innovation in the \u2018Virtual Nation Building\u2019 space, we have set up a hub for aspiring Nation Founders, where we can connect to, support and learn from each other. There\u2019s also Virtual Nation building resources, including OS Constitutions, Codes of Laws, DBVN setup instructions, and more. We hope this initiative will help other Virtual Nations to blossom, to create an amplifying effect on social and technological development speed in our shared space -- our shared ambition.</p>\n<p><br>\nDuring the DBVN process, we also recreated the Bitnation dividend paying cryptoequity token, XBN, on the Ethereum blockchain, to replace the XBNX tokens previously created on the CounterParty protocol. We have not yet released XBN on the market, because we\u2019re in the process of burning the previous XBNX CounterParty tokens, and enabling an XBNX to XBN Swapbot for the tokens that are currently in circulation. (If you have experience in the token burning and automated swapping field and want to contribute, please reach out to us)<br>\nFor decentralized fund allocation amongst the contributor community, we\u2019re working with Backfeed, a Slack chat plugin built on the Ethereum technology. Backfeed enables the contributor community (whether they\u2019re developers, administrators, marketing people, or others) to create projects, submit contributions, and get paid instantly for it, without the need for any type of top-down approval. Amongst all the \u2018organizational governance\u2019 applications we\u2019ve tested, from Colony to Boardroom and SwarmBot -- Backfeed is by far the most suitable to Bitnation\u2019s open and rapidly evolving community nature.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We\u2019re currently using many centralized platforms for our own organizational management, from Slack to Trello, Taiga to Google Drive, etc. However, I believe we\u2019ll be able to replace those applications -- eliminating the most significant centralized points of failure in the near future -- between the implementation of Pangea and Backfeed, and other technologies, like IPFS, Swarm etc. All these technologies exists, but they\u2019re generally in early Alpha or Beta, and many of them lack a non-developer friendly frontend, making its usage rather non-intuitive, as for now.</p>\n<p><br>\nFor our public communication needs, overtime we plan to shift our efforts from traditional platforms like Facebook and Twitter, to emerging blockchain based platforms, such as Steemit and Synero.</p>\n<p><strong><br>\n</strong><em><strong>In the Spotlight: BITNATION Refugee Crisis Emergency Response (BRER) and Public Notary Partnership with Estonia\u2019s e-Residency Program</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nSecond of September 2015 the photo of Alan Kurdi, the 3 year old Syrian boy in a bright red shirt, lying dead on a beach in Greece, shook the world, and the Bitnation community -- many of whom are open borders advocate, digital nomads, migrants, and more often than not, consider ourselves \u2018World Citizens\u2019 first and foremost. As Alan\u2019s photo made it around the world media, I was already living with stateless refugees in Turin, northern Italy, trying to assist them with their asylum processes, simply because they were my former employees from years back, during the time I worked in warzones, and I felt it was my duty to try help them to the best of my ability, just like they had always helped me when I was in their environment.</p>\n<p><br>\nOne of the magical aspects of Open Source Communities and Movements, is their ability to instantly gather and rally around a cause, as we\u2019ve seen movements like the Pirate Party and Anonymous do - and that was precisely what happened. Instantly, hundreds of activists gathered on our Slack chat, and in less than a week we had built a website for refugees, including a free Blockchain ID, Bitcoin Debit Cards, maps and forums. Later on, we updated the ID to the more sophisticated WORLD CITIZEN ID, which is also free.</p>\n<p><br>\nOne thing led to another, and while we were speaking to various UN agencies and NGO\u2019s to get the IDs accepted as temporary ID documents for paperless people, we were approached by the Government of Estonia. Most of the Bitnation community are dedicated anarchists who are not generally keen on working with governments, but in our enthusiasm to help refugees to cross borders, we realized we needed more recognition for our Nation from legacy entities, and Estonia\u2019s e-Residency program is famous for having an open mindset when it comes to \u2018global citizenship\u2019: hence we entered into a partnership with them to build a Blockchain Notary, and thus we became the first Virtual Nation in the world to be recognized by a Nation State. To put it in e-Estonia\u2019s own words:</p>\n<p><br>\n<em>\"In Estonia we believe that people should be able to freely choose their digital/public services best fit to them, regardless of the geographical area where they were arbitrarily born. We're truly living in exciting times when nation states and virtual nations compete and collaborate with each other on an international market, to provide better governance services.\"</em> - Kaspar Korjus, Estonia\u2019s e-Residency Director<br>\n</p>\n<p>And thus, the Public Notary was built a few weeks later, including login and digital signatures, and has since been used for everything from Marriages to Wills, to Birth Certificates, to Business Deals, Employment Contracts, and Lending Contracts, and the list goes on...</p>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>3rd Party Applications and Services - Basicincome.co, Dragonfly and Exosphere</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nCore to the governance service proposition, is the aggregation of services, which includes selection and vetting of vendors and bulk price negotiations. To that end, we have identified and partnered with a few cutting edge organizations for peer-to-peer insurance, security, and education. We aim to increase the number of partnerships in the year ahead.</p>\n<p><br>\nThe Exosphere bootcamp program is on its second round, offering Bitnation citizens a 1000 Euro discount. Special thanks to Moritz Bierling from Exosphere for organizing it. You can read about the first round here. The first insurance component to be enabled is Johan Nygren\u2019s Basic Income protocol, based on voluntary participation, similar to that of a mutual insurance. Johan has worked on the protocol for several years, and has lately been developing it on Ethereum. We\u2019re preparing to run the first tests of a simplified version of the protocol within the Bitnation core contributors group.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Challenges and Lessons Learned:</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>Technical Challenges I - Blockchains and Smart Contracts</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong><br>\n</strong></em>The foundational document for Bitnation stated our intention was to build on Ethereum, because of its near Turing completeness enabling Smart Contract functionalities. Ethereum at the time, however, was far from being released, and the community felt the urge to produce a proof-of-concept to get real world testing and usage of our idea. In retrospect, it might have been better to build on the Ethereum testnet right away, rather than using other blockchains. But social and financial pressure pushed us to choose the most suitable alternative out there at the time: the NXT/ Horizon technology, and make the best out of it until Ethereum became functional. We\u2019ve now switched over to Ethereum development, as originally planned.<br>\n</p>\n<p>However, Ethereum isn\u2019t a \u2018silver bullet\u2019 either - suffering from internal governance issues, security vulnerabilities inherent to Turing capabilities, and an immature infrastructure in terms of exchanges, wallets, etc. Hence, Ethereum is also a bit of a \u2018wild bet\u2019, albeit a very promising one - due to its original ideas, stellar implementation, and a large, vibrant community backing it.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Rootstock - a Bitcoin blockchain based smart contract platform - which will likely be publicly released this year and, from what I\u2019ve read, they\u2019ve pledged to use the same Smart Contract language as Ethereum - Solidity - to increase cross-platform portability. Ultimately, we would like to give people the choice of what blockchain to use for their agreements as easily as they can choose their code of law and arbitration method on Pangea. That\u2019s of course an optimistic ambition at this time, but if the crypto community stays as innovative and active as it currently is, I do dare to believe that some sort of bridge functionality we can incorporate into Pangea will emerge in the next year ahead.</p>\n<p><br>\nAnother platform we\u2019re keeping tabs on is Tauchain. Tauchain claims, among other features, to solve some of the security issues around smart contracts, through <em>not </em>being Turing complete. We\u2019re looking forward to see how it will pan out, once it\u2019s been released and tested on the market.</p>\n<p><strong><br>\n</strong><em><strong>Technical Challenges II - User Behavior (Chat versus Social Networking)</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nSocial networking platforms, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, has been the dominant social media arena over the last decade. Thus, it\u2019s intuitive to attempt to replicate that format. But the numbers don\u2019t match up -- in the fastest growing markets, the emerging markets around the world where our services are most needed, the so called \u2018next eleven\u2019, Facebook comes across as rather \u2018yesterday\u2019. Albeit a +1 billion person adoption, more and more people are switching over to chat applications to conduct their day-to-day bussines (special thanks to Gene Vangryeb from Tradle.io for his insightful thoughts on this). The change is largely due to the choice of smartphone rather than laptop as the go-to-device, and it turns out chat is more intuitive as a way to communicate on a smartphone, rather than a \u2018publishing platforms\u2019 such as social networks. Using social network platform as an inspiration was a significant mistake, indeed, our one most significant mistake. All transactions starts with a <em>conversation</em>. Whether getting married, or trading a real estate asset, it\u2019s all based on a dialogue between mutually consenting parties. More and more of these conversations take place online, as business as well as personal relationships increasingly move into the digital sphere.</p>\n<p><br>\nChatting with a blockchain as a backend infrastructure is incredibly expensive -- imagine paying miners\u2019 fees for every chat message you send. Sure, there are ways around it, like using a blockchain testnet instead of the live blockchain, and other fixes, but those are all rather clunky \u2018solutions\u2019. Hence, we decided to swallow our pride, ditch the code, and start from scratch again. This time around with a decentralized communications protocol as the source code (SSBC/ Patchbay) and integrate the blockchain functionalities (timestamping and smart contracts, more specifically) \u2018on top of it\u2019 instead, hence not being dependent on any one blockchain.</p>\n<p><strong><br>\n</strong><em><strong>Lack of Documentation</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nOne of our most fatal mistakes, in the first iteration of the Pangea software a year ago, was the lack of documentation. When we initially created Pangea, we were eager to produce a proof-of-concept, to make our idea more tangible to the community and early adopters. In the speed and enthusiasm that unfolded in the early stage of development, the documentation suffered. As much as we produced code, there was nearly zero documentation to support it. In an Open Source Software (OSS) environment, dependent on volunteers coming and going, on their own initiative, throughout different time zones, languages and cultures, it\u2019s key to be able to provide a direct, comprehensible and actionable overview of the software being built, so community members can instantly understand what needs to be done, and where their skills fit into the picture. However, we failed to do so. Hence, we became dependent on a few contributors, rather than the community at large, indeed a risky place to be in. Many volunteers wanted to contribute to Pangea, but there was no documentation to instruct them how to take it forward. In other words, the code was a jungle.</p>\n<p><br>\nIt was a hard lesson to learn, but I\u2019m happy we learned it early on in the process, and can change our \u2018modus operandi\u2019 for this Pangea iteration. We\u2019ll now put documentation at the highest priority, even if it means delivery speed might suffer as a consequence at times.</p>\n<p><strong><br>\n</strong><strong>Objectives For The Year Ahead:</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>Bitnation Pangea Development</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong><br>\n</strong></em><strong>Why Build A Jurisdiction?</strong></p>\n<p><br>\nA nation is a broad definition, covering several aspects, from its original term of \u2018people with shared culture and values coming together with some sense of political autonomy\u2019 - as per the Wikipedia definition - to our modern definition of governance service providers, and governance service aggregators.</p>\n<p><br>\nToday we expect governments to provide us with nearly everything - from education to energy infrastructure, food regulations to social security - and the list seems to grow by the day. However, if we break the government down to its essential functions, according to the \u2018Nightwatchman State model\u2019 as championed by Robert Nozick - the government's core purpose only really comes down to the protection of property - i.e. the provision of security and jurisdiction. Note: property is a broad term, not solely referring to property as in land, items, etc. Property starts with ownership of yourself, your body, your time, your aspirations, etc.</p>\n<p><br>\nIn the digital age, security and jurisdiction are increasingly becoming the same thing, as more of our assets (money, asset records, work etc) become digital. Furthermore, the extremely rapid development of Smart Contract technology opens new horizons in terms of creating online agreements with a range of built in automated functions (fund and token distribution, escrow, insurance, timestamping, decision making levels, etc). Hence, it makes sense for Bitnation to focus on building a Blockchain Jurisdiction as its core functionality.<br>\nWithin the smart contract functionality, sophisticated governance applications can already be built directly by end-users, such as mutual insurances, constitutions, etc.</p>\n<p><br>\nImagine solving a dispute by sending a heart <3 emoticon. An emoticon that calls upon Ethereum Smart Contract functionality - including an embedded escrow account - according to the code of law and the arbitration method that you have chosen for yourselves - and all of it in less than two minutes, from the comfort of your own phone. Our aim with the Pangea platform is to empower people to make sophisticated legal agreements simply through the use of emoticons in a smartphone chat interface. The frontend will be built using React.JS, as originally planned, because it\u2019s better suited for mobile first applications.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Initial Technical Overview</strong></p>\n<p><br>\nThe codebase we\u2019re using is Secure Scuttelbutt (SSBC), a distributed and end-to-end encrypted messaging protocol, and its frontend application Patchbay. It\u2019s more decentralized than other chat applications currently on the market, including Signal.</p>\n<p><br>\nDecentralized storage will be done through integrating IPFS as well as Swarm (the Ethereum powered storage application) on the frontend layer. Initially our plan is to integrate functions calling on the Ethereum chain for smart contract creation and execution, but we hope we\u2019ll be able to use Rootstock and other protocols in the future, in addition to Ethereum. The platform however is <em>not</em> blockchain based.</p>\n<p><br>\nThe pseudo-anonymous ID/ Verification/ Reputation functions will be built from the ground up, on the advice of Dominic Tarr, the SSBC inventor, although we\u2019ll use some of the digital signature features developed for Bitnation\u2019s World Citizenship ID by Johan Paulsson, Andrew Golighty, Mawo, SGShankar and others. Additionally, we\u2019re drawing inspiration from the identi.fi philosophy, developed by Marrti Malmi.<br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Participants, Messages &amp; Channels</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p>Pseudo-anonymous identities provide the critical separation between a citizen\u2019s thoughts and actions and the potential for coercion of their physical bodies in order to restrict or control those thoughts and actions. Pseudo-anonymous identities are thus, by design, a declaration of independence from centralised governance models. For them to have meaning they must have three elements. Firstly, and obviously, the protocol that enables pseudo-anonymous identities to to be created, secondly the process for verifying an identity (which can range from social network verification to uploading a copy of a utility bill, for instance), and lastly, and most importantly, the reputation system, which is built over time and represents the judgement of each citizen\u2019s community of their willingness and ability to honour and arbitrate contracts.</p>\n<p><br>\nFor internal management, BITNATION uses a holacratic governance model. The underlying principle is that all BITNATION citizens are free to create their own holons, and ultimately their own Nations, without any barrier to entry or need for technical knowledge. SSBC provides the means for BITNATION adherents to create their own holons and Nations without any requirement for centralised approval. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Contracts, Contract Arbitration Models, Contract Enforcement Models and Incentives Models</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p>Sovereignty starts with the ability of individuals to make consensual agreements with others. We consent to give our sovereignty to Nation States by believing their rhetoric: that only Nation States can uphold those agreements. But what if we could make and enforce contracts without third party intermediaries who choose to use that power to enforce their methods upon us? Just as citizens can choose their own code of law, they must also be able to choose their own preferred method of arbitration. These can range from choosing a trusted arbitrator to mediate contract disputes to utilising a crowd jury to make final judgements. A voluntary contract must also mean that citizens can choose from a range of enforcement methods. These could include reputation, escrow or physical enforcement (peer-to-peer security). We anticipate that the most widely used form of contract enforcement will be the reputation system. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\nWe believe that financial incentives hold promise for the future. To that end we are exploring a range of financially incentivised models for dispute resolution where participants get rewarded for honouring contracts, building their reputation, and providing arbitration services. However, there will be no \u2018dispute resolution\u2019 token anytime soon, although we\u2019re monitoring current token platform incentive models for potential future usage.<br>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Potential Synergies</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nIn light of the release of Ethereum, and the subsequent growing Smart Contract field, many initiative centered around peer-to-peer law, security and jurisdiction services are being experimented with. I would like to take the opportunity to mention a few of the most interesting ones in our field, whom I hope, moving forward, we\u2019ll be able to learn from, and potentially collaborate with.</p>\n<p><br>\nBitrated: Bitrated was the first well known attempt to implement Bitcoin based dispute resolution. They created a user-friendly, intuitive proof-of-concept, including basic escrow and reputation features. We\u2019ve always been impressed and inspired by Bitrated, and hope we can collaborate in the future.</p>\n<p><br>\nDecentralized Arbitration and Mediation Network (DAMN): DAMN is an Ethereum based dispute resolution protocol proposed by the well known Bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos and the Attorney Pamela Morgan. The aim of DAMN differs from Bitnation, in the sense they aim to create a legal platform compatible with existing Nation State Jurisdictions, rather than creating an independent blockchain Jurisdiction. However, we\u2019re positive we can gain valuable insights from their work, and we will follow their progress closely.</p>\n<p><br>\nULEX: ULEX is an attempt by Chapman University Professor Tom W. Bell to code a simplified and modulable code of law, based on Common Law. While Bitnation firmly believes in Polycentric Legal Models, i.e. multiple competing codes of law, we recognize this particular code of law holds a lot of promise, and will work to integrate it as soon as there\u2019s a working version of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>\nReputation Systems: I would like to give a shout out to Steemit and Synereo for their work on token based reputation systems, which we\u2019ll study in depth for potential future usage, as well as identi.fi, a non-blockchain based reputation system, which we draw most of our ID/Rep inspiration from, specifically in terms of \u2018good anti-social behaviour strategy\u2019 in the context of whitelisting versus blacklisting methodology.</p>\n<p><br>\nThank you for the interesting technologies and the community contribution you\u2019re doing with your work.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Join The Governance Decentralization Movement</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"slack.bitnation.co\">Slack</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Bit-Nation\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bitnation.co/\">Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyBitNation\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MyBitnation/\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><br>\n\"<em><strong>I am the seasoned traveler</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Of the Labyrinth.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>The genius of alacrity,</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Wizard of the impossible.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>My brilliance is yet unmatched</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>In its originality.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>My heart\u2019s filled with potent magic</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>That could cast a hundred spells.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>I am put together</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>For mine own pleasure</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>I am the Monkey\"</strong></em></p>\n<p><br>\nChinese poem on The Year of the Monkey - 2016<br>\n</p>\n</html>",

I have been disappointed in psychiatrists and started a course of self-treatment. <strong>And let me tell you, I improved my mental health</strong>!</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"https://s18.postimg.org/8rx76wem1/intro.jpg\"><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/5hvpsm8c7/intro_small.jpg\"></a></center></p>\n<p>This post contains over 70 photographs made in September 5, 2016 in Ussuriysk, Russia.</p>\n<p>I will start with satisfying the curiosity of my potential readers and tell what my condition is all about. I have 4 inner dialogues and each of them is about total nonsense. Derelaizations and depersonalizations happen occasionally. Sometimes, I have paranoid ideas and crazy concepts. Seldom, I start hitting my head against the wall or start cutting myself. There are times when I feel such a weakness that I can\u2019t make my way from my bedroom to kitchen. And most importantly, there are four of me.</p>\n<p>To be exact, I\u2019m inhabited with 4 subpersonalities. They switch and take over my body. One of the purposes of my post is the aspiration to show that we mentally deranged people are not as scary and horrible as mass media picture us. <strong>A day of our life is, in essence, no different from yours</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Basically, this is all you need to know to compresence the context and we can move on to images!&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> The alarm wakes me up in the morning. I would definitely sleep till 3 pm, if it didn\u2019t happen. I need to get up \u2013 I have a lot of things to do. I\u2019m still sleepy and finding a clock that I could take a photo of to show you the time is nearly impossible. Thus I just made a screenshot of my phone screen.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/jlv12dtez/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Please, meet Christine and Skinner. Christine is 24 and she is psychologist, she works here in the hospital. Skinner is 5 months old. He is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_%28dog%29\">newfoundland</a> puppy, lives here with me. Skinner loves coming in the morning to wake us up, sniffing and licking us. Simultaneously, he makes funny noises like \u201cnuff-nuff-nuff-nuff\u201d. This is why we call him \u201cnuff-nuff\u201d occasionally or \u201cnuffich\u201d. This photo is him waking up Christine and looking in the camera with his happy face.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/ryq2embvn/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Going to kitchen\u2026</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/nohna5eqx/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> \u2026Not to drink coffee. Coffee can wait. I have far more important things to do \u2013 I need to take my psycho-drugs before symptoms start. I noticed long ago that when I do it in the morning, there is less of a chance that my illness will show itself during the day.</p>\n<p>I must tell those who are not familiar with being a psycho that this small medical kit in the photo is much richer than I had in the asylum where I was. From all this versatility I need only three drugs: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion\">Bupropion</a> for physical and mental strength, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnacipran\">Milnacipran</a> to keep me motivated to do something and fighting off sleepiness (basically, enhancing Bupropion effect), and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amisulpride\">Amisulpride</a> to reduce the amount of inner dialogues to one and keep my thought process together.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/xxdpa2qq7/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> Took medication, drank coffee, and off to check my mail. Here I must say that due to illness I can no longer work in the domain where I have a relevant diploma and more than 10 years of experience. Sadly, this is the state of affairs.</p>\n<p>This is why I have to make living by taking various jobs in various domains. The morning gives me a new job (I intentionally removed contact information and the job description so that no one would call me out on self-advertising).</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/c3mm0klo1/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> The mail is checked, social networks are checked, I can go to the balcony and smoke. The balcony is in another room. Yes, it is a bicycle. No, it\u2019s not electrical. No, it is not hard to pedal. There were times when I was winning tournaments riding this bicycle, but it happened before illness.</p>\n<p>A strange composition made of tinder behind the bicycle is a small fence around cat\u2019s litter box (Skinner loves throwing around its contents and we had to build this thing).</p>\n<p>Cardboard on the floor is a result of an interaction between my cat and Skinner. The cat dropped a cardboard box (she loved sleeping in it) on Skinner and he nearly tore it apart (not cat, the box).</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/gneq58gzr/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> It is time to walk Nuff-Nuff. Today, it\u2019s raining. I feel lazy, but I need to go. Newfoundlands grow inconsistently. Often, their feet lagging behind their bodies in growth. This is why newfoundland puppies need to walk every day not less than 7 kilometers.</p>\n<p>Anyways, off we go. We start from going to marshes near our house. I rarely see anyone there and in high bushes the puppy can do his \u201cthings\u201d without annoying anyone. After that, we make our way through the town (to be exact, towards the outskirts) in order to get enough travel length.</p>\n<p>Today, we met an ugly old lady who attacked us by yelling that my dog leaves her \u201cpresents\u201d near her house (my dog never satisfies its natural needs near households, I make sure of it). The old hag literally attacked us!</p>\n<p>Sometimes, I don\u2019t understand how come that they are the crazy ones and it\u2019s me who has a diagnosis.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/dd10u1hc3/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>8.</strong> We are past city blocks now and heading towards the dam. A small river flows here and usually you can barely notice it, but it has a weird tendency to overflow and cause massive town-wide floods. The dam was built to prevent it, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t help. Last year, for example, water went over the dam and flooded the surroundings.</p>\n<p>Some say that there is typhoon here right now (I don\u2019t really follow the news), but the river is fairly small.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/jznjooi6h/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>9.</strong> We got home. Skinner fell down due to fatigue. This means our tour was successful.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/q9k8lcgjj/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>10.</strong> After walking, I need to wash his feet so he wouldn\u2019t leave dirty tracks all around. I take Nuffich, drag him in the bath, and start pouring water on his feet till all the dirt is gone.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/vcjw5k53x/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>11.</strong> Skinner ran out of food. The thing is you can\u2019t just buy pebbles in the pet store. One has to order it in the local dog club and wait till it arrives. We didn\u2019t estimate right this time and the old pack of food depleted before the new one arrived. Today, Skinner eats natural organic food.</p>\n<p>In our book about \u201cnewfs\u201d we read that when feeding them naturally we need to add fruits and vegetables, thus Christine cuts a squash and apples.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/hbpman3op/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>12.</strong> A happy doggy is having a meal.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/vvdctvwqf/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>13.</strong> I also feel hungry after a long promenade. I usually eat sitting in front of my PC despite knowing that it\u2019s not classy or healthy. On the other hand, you can definitely multitask. For example, I participate in a hot discussion about psychology on a popular internet forum.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/ls53caklz/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>14.</strong> As I mentioned before, I am no longer capable of working in my field of experience and knowledge. Instead, I make money \u201coccasionally\u201d or simply don\u2019t do anything. Obviously, this cannot continue eternally and I try to make a resume. I hope, there is a place for me somewhere. It took a lot of time to update or create resumes on all available \u201chunter\u201d sites.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/6kykgqi8r/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>15.</strong> I need to get ready. Today, I need to visit the nuthouse. Actually, I chose self-treatment, but some medications I can get only at hospitals. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam\">Alprazolam</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medazepam\">Medazepam</a>. These help me function and avoid hiding behind my blanket fearing everything. Our beloved &lt;insert a swear word&gt; government moved it to the list III (a special list of officially supervised medications) and it is quite hard to get them nowadays.</p>\n<p>Doctors usually give receipts without enthusiasm. Medications are supervised and drug stores do not sell them without receipts. And even if you have a receipt, they will not sell you more than the receipt says.</p>\n<p>In real life it means that one has to either take medication frugally (which means taking less than you should when you have a disorder like mine) or invent various sneaky ways of obtaining the drug. I, for one, have multiple patient cards in different cities. The chance of getting medication is much higher this way.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/vlxiewd9j/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>16.</strong> Christine decided to make a company. We both know that we will have an unpleasant conversation. We start procrastinating and calming our nerves through smoking. I know that smoking doesn\u2019t really calm you, but that\u2019s what everyone says.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/q0bn54q2n/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>17.</strong> Here it is. My beloved nuthouse!</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/6gmqjz9gl/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>18.</strong> Admittedly, the asylum in Ussuriysk is not that bad. The doctors here are polite, no one propagandizes church and its saving capabilities, and there is even a special depression and agitation board on the paper stand.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/vgjtkd0w5/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>19.</strong> Waiting in a queue. There is no running away from queueing.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/6rvvkbjl9/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>20.</strong> What to do while waiting for a doctor? That\u2019s right, read books about psychotherapy. For those interested this is Fritz Perls \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.ru/books/about/The_gestalt_approach_Eye_witness_to_ther.html?id=u0dsAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y\">The Gestalt Approach and Eye Witness to Therapy</a>\u201d.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/my1ttzajl/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>21.</strong> I need to go here. To be honest, the whole endeavor today was pointless. I didn\u2019t get new tranquilizer receipts and I didn\u2019t need anything else.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/onqmnxuk9/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>22.</strong> Me and Christine on our way home in a taxi. A quick selfie.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/csev9aegv/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>23.</strong> Nuffich is happy to see us and starts licking my neck!</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/wiass5me3/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>24.</strong> 1.30 pm\u2026</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/5ojdrql0f/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>25.</strong> \u2026If I want to avoid passing out due to fatigue and sleepiness, I need to take another pill of Bupropion. That is exactly what I\u2019m doing right now.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/9ywun2753/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>26.</strong> It is time to work. I need to write to my employer, answer a couple of tricky questions (I like her for making me read and think a lot in order to come up with a reasonable answer). Simultaneously, I could boost my profile page on a popular social network related to hunting for work and exchanging business contacts.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/bob4wu99z/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>27.</strong> Christine and Nuff-Nuff are sleeping. I envy them and do not envy them simultaneously. I envy because the sleep. I don\u2019t envy because I know why they are sleeping in the middle of a day.</p>\n<p>Nuffich is tired after a long morning walk. Christine is sick. Her depression is exacerbating. Not that \u201cI-have-a-bad-mood-and-need-a-chocolate-bar\u201d kind of depression. It\u2019s an illness. An illness that makes one a disabled person.</p>\n<p>This is a sad irony. One of the best specialists in the field of mental therapy felt victim to one of illnesses she was studying. Drugs that she takes help, but she never reached the stage of remission. This is why sometimes she loses strength and the only thing she can do is sleep. Endogenic apathetic depression equals hell.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/86j0anwlv/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>28.</strong> It\u2019s time to walk my puppy again. While he is young, you need to walk him at least 4 times per day.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s3.postimg.org/5rlu7z5tv/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>29.</strong> Our favorite walking paths are flooded. Despite swimming capabilities natural for newfoundlands (they were bred for fishing and helping taking nets out of water), Skinner doesn\u2019t seem to be enthusiastic about diving in this dirty puddle.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/y3wbn90hb/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>30.</strong> Well, we can always walk around the town.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/n96p7v7i9/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>31.</strong> We returned back home and Skinner needs to eat. Meals are also at least 4 times per day.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/x9auws3gt/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>32.</strong> Today, I need to visit local dog owners club to pick up dog food, but I still have some time to work.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/m9m6dorvb/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>33.</strong> Lots of things to do! I need to mod a small community related to psychiatry, finish my article, write to my employer, and up my resume.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/pmmiq60ub/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>34.</strong> After finishing everything, I move to another room. I want to fix my bicycle. Mysteriously, Christine managed to tear away rear brake caliper. I swear, I used to exploit this detail in such a manner that would raise goosebumps and nothing. She made a circle around the park and the mount bolt is gone\u2026</p>\n<p>I also need to pump up wheels. Basically, I get this bicycle ready for proper usage again.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/4kwligit7/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>35.</strong> I return to my laptop, check my e-mails, resume, new posts, and comments in the community.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/3xd77djel/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>36.</strong> I want to eat. Christine made some semolina while I was walking with Nuff-Nuff. I\u2019m going to eat some.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/mjdzh8yrz/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>37.</strong> Again a screenshot with time on it so you would know what time it is now.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/88b95eyv5/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>38.</strong> I have about an hour to talk with my employer. I\u2019m putting on my headset, turn on the music, and start writing.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/drj2nfqxr/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>39.</strong> Dog owner club is open now. I need to pick up Skinner\u2019s food.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/cpfs7ds4d/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>40.</strong> This is why I love Ussuriysk (slightly less than Vladivostok and Moscow). You won\u2019t see a lot of advertising. Walkways are everywhere and no one leaves their cars on these walkways.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s18.postimg.org/k7glklxcp/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>41.</strong> Local landmark \u2013 a fountain. In the evening, the classic music and lighting turn on.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/6ezzhjnab/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>42.</strong> Central square of my town. This is people\u2019s favorite party place.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/qw73u4yw7/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>43.</strong> 1 more mile and I\u2019m near the club.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/50oyjfb07/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>44.</strong> The club is in the cellar of the building that was constructed in Soviet times as a part of a college.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/5e5xvuovh/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>45.</strong> You can\u2019t really see it on the photo, but the door is very low and I have to bent in order to walk in.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/x58ic2r3r/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>46.</strong> The club is preparing for a show. The whole room is filled with goblets, banners, and other stuff. I\u2019m definitely the odd one here. I quickly pay for my goods and hurry to retreat so that I would not annoy people who are busy with preparations.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/68h8h2561/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>47.</strong> The pack is very heavy (17 kilograms) and it\u2019s a long way home. I\u2019m not in the best physical form, so I decided to take a taxi. I brought the pack home. Both Christine and Nuff-Nuff are studying it now. Both are doing their research based on their understanding of effectiveness: Christine is reading, Nuffich is trying to taste it.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/govblrfup/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>48.</strong> Newfoundlands are growing slowly. In particular, Skinner is 5 months old and we are walking him out 4 times per day. Yet sometimes, he needs a litter box. The litter box is a rubber car carpet (prevents pee from spilling on the floor) with a diaper on top. The diapers have to be washed and that is exactly what I\u2019m doing now.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/68ui9ija7/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>49.</strong> I felt hungry for coffee.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/n659ti695/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>50.</strong> It is time for our next walk. This time, Christine decided to join us.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/42og7iuyf/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>51.</strong> \u201cNewfs\u201d have a very interesting feat, they love to carry things in their mouth. An adult \u201cnewf\u201d can easily carry a pack of groceries. Skinner is carrying only sticks for now.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/t896fhjsj/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>52.</strong> The return. It is again time to feed Skinner. We open the pack with dogfood. It looks that Skinner is happy that he doesn\u2019t have to eat natural food.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/6vmpoa435/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>53.</strong> The client calls me on the phone and we talk for a long time.</p>\n<p>Christine decided to ride the bicycle noticing that I have fixed it.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/xloj8dvv5/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>54.</strong> While she was hiking around the town, I talked with my client and ex-colleague. We talked about various stuff. It took about one hour or so.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/p5bqrnaxp/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>55.</strong> I\u2019m hungry. I feel too lazy to cook. In addition, there\u2019s nothing to cook. I took a pack of dry noodles, covered it with a layer of spices, and ate it dry.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/511jubstb/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>56.</strong> I return to the PC. I need to write a couple of posts for community, boost my profile in the business social network, and search for new jobs.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/40eb0jpm5/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>57.</strong> Christine, unlike me, doesn\u2019t like eating dry noodles and offered to go to the supermarket. It is dark outside and my old trusty phone makes terrible photos. Those lights ahead are a part of supermarket\u2019s fa\u00e7ade (I intentionally made the photo from beneath the trees so that the brand would be cut out and people won\u2019t think that I advertise it).</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/6ylsqcqen/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>58.</strong> We bought some groceries, fruits and vegetables mostly. Money is a problem at the moment. Unfortunately, we meat and delicacies decided to stay in the supermarket.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/vfjheefp5/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>59.</strong> It\u2019s 9 pm. Moscow people are now awake.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s21.postimg.org/5r0myi7hz/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>60.</strong> Christine and Nuffich are sleeping. I turned off the light to not distract them.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/e8cyumuxr/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>61.</strong> I need a very specific whiteboard with unorthodox features for my work. Asking in communities and reading reviews did not help and I decided to try every single one meticulously testing each. The time is running.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/tcjealdv1/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>62.</strong> The night brings anxiety and makes me more petulant. I realize that I have an urge to break apart my laptop because everything inside it is scary\u2026</p>\n<p>Also, soon I will have to go to sleep. This means that a scary moment when you fall asleep is ahead of me. The moment when thoughts come. They start pressuring and tearing you apart\u2026 You want to howl, to run away, but there\u2019s no running away from oneself\u2026</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we are way past the stone age and know that there are antixiliotics to fight such conditions. One pill of Medazepam and everything starts to look brighter.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s16.postimg.org/ojgvcj9t1/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>63.</strong> Oh, I remember! The diapers are done washing! I\u2019m going to hang them to dry on the balcony.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/pihyfrs29/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>64.</strong> 20 minutes before 12. I need to walk my puppy again.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/bh5vja4o9/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>65.</strong> In the darkness of night my phone can\u2019t take photos at all. This is the best picture out of a whole set!</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s3.postimg.org/4ybt28i9f/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>66.</strong> We returned home. Heading to the bath to wash feet. It\u2019s a good time for a classic mirror selfie.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/dnzsxhan3/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>67.</strong> I fed my puppy. It is time to take a shower.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s12.postimg.org/4h707mfvh/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>68.</strong> I check what\u2019s new in the internet.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/q52rfhktt/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>69.</strong> It\u2019s time to close my laptop go to sleep.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/kfkymn6dr/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p><strong>70.</strong> Nuff-Nuff, for example, is sleeping like a baby.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/vw6b2nxnj/image.jpg\"></center></p>\n<blockquote>Many will exhale: \u201c<em>But where is madness? Where is blood? Where is vandalism? Where are hallucinations, at least</em>?\u201d To this I can only answer that in reality <strong>\u201c</strong><em><strong>we</strong></em><strong>\u201d are not that different from \u201c</strong><em><strong>you</strong></em><strong>\u201d</strong>. Yes, mentally ill people have their exacerbations and dangerous conditions. However, these do not happen all the time, not to everyone, and can be fixed through taking appropriate medications. Without special knowledge, the vast majority of people will never recognize a mentally ill person in a crowd.

Now with help from @pulpaply on the Curating side its going to be even more active in the future! We are also soon receiving help from another user (which I don't know the name of yet) but I just wanted to say that these 2 Curators have been manually welcoming new users to the site before they heard about @projectnewbie and I want to thank them personally for their welcoming comments and help to new users!\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/RoUsIgX.jpg\n(Logo by @acidyo)\n\nSince I was the only one active most of the first week, I decided to push forward the weekly SD reward so that I don't receive most of it (since that was 70 SD and the posts on this account haven't made as much this week), I thought it would be more fair to the new Curators and possible Finders to get them some time to activate themselves and thus share the rewards more evenly in the 2nd week! \n\nNominees to @projectnewbie:\n\n**Day 1 - 8 users**\n**Day 2 - 10 users**\n**Day 3 & 4 - 14 users**\n**Day 5, 6 & 7 - 13 users**\n\n**Week 1 - 45 verified users**\n\nI see many users without any sort of verification, and to not give the fake ones a chance to abuse the project or the votes of the rest of the community - we decided that with our personal accounts we will let the newcomers who haven't verified themselves know about @projectnewbie. If they after verify, they will receive welcoming comment and hopefully in time more attention through the users that follow this account.\n\nSince this project is growing with 3 Curators and around 10 unique Finders so far, we hope the community continues to support the project and gets these posts some visibility so more users who haven't heard of it yet get a chance to.\n\nThanks for reading! If you find any introduction posts from new and legit users - don't forget to link them to #projectnewbie on steem.chat for a Finders Reward!",

    "body": "So, because I can't edit the [previous introduction post](https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@gamer00/be-happy) with new information I'm creating a second one here.\n\n<center>[![Mushrooms](https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5704/23131661076_7b210076df_h.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/Bf4NWG)\nMushrooms</center>\n\nI'm a photographer, enthusastic [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) player, and a long time Linux user. I also play some computer games and alto+soprano recorder. I also have a self-assembled 3d-printer I dabble with every now and then. While I did graduate as an artesan learning mainly SolidWorks, I prefer to use FreeCAD for my creations.\n\nI run a local Go club Saarto with about 10 more or less active players. We've been playing together for over 4 years now.\n\nI am planning to advertise our club a bit so other interested players could join our games. We have also talked about expanding our reach to kids in the schools of our own children. The plan is to run a series of go club activities in their school, preferably create a club event of few weeks or months. We'll see how that idea works out, but it's still in planning stages.\n\n<center>[![Game of Go in our club](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8491/8297692520_dd32aac7e0_h.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/dDeQU9)\nGame of Go in our club</center>\n\nI have two amazing, artistically talented sons, [Leo](https://diasp.org/posts/1234803) and [Miro](https://diasp.org/posts/6038187), whom I love both very much. I try to be a good father, sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail.\n\n<center>[![Leo and Miro](https://c7.staticflickr.com/2/1652/24608923622_276ed1c239_h.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/DuBaCA)\nLeo is 10 years old, and Miro turns 6 next week.</center>\n\nParenting is a tough job, but very rewarding. I might have to write about it every now and then. Both my boys know how to play Go and Chess, they also love other board games, Go not so much, I wonder why. They recently bought a PlayStation 3 with their weekly \"earnings\" though, so board games have experienced a slight inflation lately anyway.\n\n<center>[![That's me!](https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8489/29060431133_9b06242d48_h.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/LgYiJ6)\nThe thing is, I'm not very good with selfies.</center>\n\nI love cryptocurrencies, they are the future.\n\nI have opinions, some may like them, some don't.\n\nThere are places you can find me on the Internet:\n[@AmbyR00](https://diasp.org/i/962f1eafef11) on Diaspora\n[@AmbyR00](https://twitter.com/AmbyR00) on Twitter\nAmbyR00 on [DGS](http://www.dragongoserver.net/), [OGS](https://online-go.com/user/view/147264) and [Pandanet (IGS)](http://pandanet-igs.com/)\n[World is my Goban](https://worldismygoban.com/) (Blog)\n...and of course I have some empty Youtube channels, but maybe we'll get to them some other time.\n\nIt's getting very late so I'll finish my introductory post here. I'll be seeing you guys in the next posting!\n\nOh, and if you liked what you read and saw, please consider upvoting and/or subscribing! It'd really make my day! :)\n\n\n[[previous post](https://steemit.com/photography/@gamer00/sometimes-there-s-creepy-stuff-out-there)]",

I heard about it through one of my Twitter contacts Jeff Berwick, so I wanted to see what's poppin'! I was hoping to be the first anarchist author to give away eBooks on Steemit, but I'm sure someone beat me to it by now. Oh well. I've had the unique experience of working in Hollywood, the financial industry, and real estate industry all at the same time during the height of what led to the 2008 crash. I know what's going on. I've been in their presence. I wrote an allegorical tale based on my life and at the same time incorporating elements of my favorite stories so that people can equip themselves to stand in Truth and reclaim the control of their own thoughts, emotions, and actions so that they can live a way of life that minimizes their exposure to this dying paradigm of debt and death as well as live in a manner that causes the least amount of suffering possible.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Both stories are free as eBooks at most major online retailers. They tried to ruin me and make me infamous back in 2015, but I squashed the story by exposing both the banking system and Bill Clinton's association with Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile ring in the Caribbean. Not a great thing for the news to draw attention to while gearing up for Hitlery's now infamous presidential failure. She came, she saw, and by the end of the year she will have been conquered.</p>\n<p>I'm currently working on Book 3 of my series, as well as a non-fiction book that will expose the blackest of all magick, that which our entire system of Commerce is based on. Hopefully I'll be done by the end of the year, but I don't have the resource to work on them as much as I'd like to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tarotartblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/rsz_onora_final_25_rgb_basic.jpg?w=648\" width=\"648\" height=\"945\"/></p>\n<p>Till next time, Omnia Vincit Veritas!

Often living single lives of quiet desperation.\n \nMy job is to **help men overcome their irrational fears** so they can connect with the women of their dreams.\n \n# How Did I Get That Job?\n \nOriginally I did stand up comedy for many years. You can see a clip of my comedy here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x7yaJXEjIU\n \nYears later, I was one of the first YouTubers to put up **videos of myself hitting on girls (sober)** in broad daylight (yes, sober!)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddjZf7Nqbo0\n \nThis gave birth to an entire movement \u2013 soon **thousands of men** all over the world starting doing the same. The art of meeting women during the daytime is called *\u201cDaygame\u201d.*\n \nSince those early days, I\u2019ve uploaded quite a few dating advice videos, which have helped **inspired millions of men** to overcome their limited self beliefs, **start loving and respecting themselves as men**, and to start living their lives as shameless sexual beings.\n \n### Many have made amazing connections with women, and are living happily ever after.\n \nFor years my passion has been helping men realize that there is nothing wrong or shameful about wanting sex, or approaching women for sex. In fact, **women appreciate a man who has the courage** to be up-front about his intentions.\n \nNow, my passion has grown more into areas of self development, and I work with men in improving all areas of their lives!\n \nI look forward to posting some articles on here and connecting with the Steem community!",

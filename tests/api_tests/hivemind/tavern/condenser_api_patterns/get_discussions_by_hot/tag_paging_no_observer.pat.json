    "body": "Eight years have passed since we encountered the severe financial crisis that badly shook our economy. Back in 2008, we witnessed some of the most tiresome times for the financial markets. The last time something close to that had occurred, or even worse, was in the 1930s when the Great Depression had hit our economy. However, the economy has settled now from the adverse effects of the 2008 crisis and is behaving in a more normal manner, but what if those economic nightmares happened again? Are we prepared enough for that? Here are a few important lessons that everyone should learn from the economic crisis of 2008.\n\n1. Prepare yourself for the unexpected\nYou might have heard the saying that you should always expect the unexpected. Surely, you will never know what tomorrow may bring. You should always be ready for the uncertain events that might occur anytime. The financial markets might be stable today, but they can become unstable tomorrow. So it is essential for you to take some steps to prepare yourself.\n\n2. Don\u2019t entirely believe in the good face of the market\nDo you see too much good around you? Is there a constant rise in markets? Are loans available to everyone easily? Are interest rates continually lower than expected? You should watch out if anything like that happens. Always remember that too much good is never good for anyone. These conditions only create a false sense of security. People take more loans because of the lower interest rates and when things get back to normal, it causes a crisis.\n\n3. Always invest for long-term gains\nIf you want to live tension-free when the next financial crisis occurs, it is crucial that you start investing for long-term gains rather than short-term ones. These short-term gains might appear tempting, but they won't help you at all in the long run and not even in an economic crisis. You might not know this, but short-term investments increase the possibility of illiquidity when you need the cash, leaving you empty-handed.\n\n4. Experts know a lot but not everything\nIf you blindly believe what experts say, you might not be able to survive the crisis. We put our trust in the experts whether they were economists, stock analysts, fund managers, accounting firms, the government, industry regulators, CEOs, and what happened? They disappointed us. Not all, but surely some of them lied to us and knowingly deceived us for their personal gain and greed. The crisis of 2008 has clearly demonstrated that even the geniuses of our economy fail too. Undoubtedly, this is the best lesson from the past crises. We should not blindly trust the professionals as their predictions can be wrong and misleading.\n\n5. Make your investment approach flexible\nWhen a crisis hits, opportunities can come in various ways which you might have no idea about. This is why it's important that you have a flexible investment approach. Never get too attached to a single",

    "body": "Have you ever looked at famous entrepreneurs and wondered about the secret to their success? You might have heard a lot that people who are highly successful are the ones who are extremely motivated. It is true to some extent but not entirely. Motivation is undoubtedly necessary for everything you do, but what play a significant role in being successful are your actions and habits.\nThat's right, your actions can determine your future. If you are a person whose days are dominated by vigorous and productive practices, you are more likely to get successful. Here are some of the habits that you need to adopt to become a great entrepreneur.\n\n1. Wake Up Early in the Morning\nRising early is one of the most crucial practices that you should embrace to become a great entrepreneur. It is the time when you have clarity of mind and are fully recharged and fresh. Are you saying that you already wake up at eight in the morning? Well, when I say early in the morning, I mean way early. Most of the successful entrepreneurs wake up even before 6 a.m. You might not believe it, but Tim Cook (the CEO of Apple) wakes up at 4:30 a.m. whereas Richard Branson (founder of Virgin Group) at 05:45 a.m.\n\n2. Read as Much as You Can\nReading helps you generate new ideas, augments your ability to focus, expands and boosts your memory, improves and broadens your views, makes you more creative, and motivates you in many different ways. All of those qualities are vital for an entrepreneur. That's why you should read for at least 30 to 60 seconds in the morning or before going to bed. Even Bill Gates, a well-known entrepreneur, is a total book lover. He reads a lot every now and then. He even publishes posts on his website about book recommendations.\n\n3. Take Small but Frequent Breaks\nTaking breaks during your work will make you more energetic and involved. Most of the people who work hard day and night are more likely to get stressed and frantic. If you're thinking that an entrepreneur-in-making should stick to what they are doing and shouldn't take breaks at all, you are wrong. Adequate breaks between your work will make you more productive. It is said that most successful people work for about 60 to 90 minutes and then take a 20-minute break.\n\n4. Keep Looking for Inspiration\nNo matter how successful you are in your life, never stop seeking inspiration. Everyone has to deal with some major hindrances in their life. Sometimes, it becomes hard to overcome them as we suffer a mental roadblock. If this happens to you, you should never lose hope and look for inspiration. The best place to get inspired is watching inspirational videos on TED or reading successful entrepreneur stories or biographies. These things will help you remember to stay on track and keep doing your thing even when things appear bleak.\n\n5. Other Habits to Remember\nSome other practices to remember are to always opt for healthy meals, exercise early in the morning to kick-start your brain and body, set daily goals, follow a plan and take action, stay organized, manage your time effectively, be persistent, and always be grateful.",

      "body": "## In this episode, a hot Aedapt girl helps Jack escape Killer giant Cockroaches! ##\n\n**Jake was peering through cracks between the plaster laths back into the room where they guard stood.** \n\n![enter image description here](https://s22.postimg.org/d4vifrmo1/Madison.jpg)\n***Missed an episode? Great more great reading for you [on my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr)! Be sure to follow me for awesome daily updates in your feed and leave me comments. I love comments!***\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not that smart when we\u2019re under. We can really only do what we hear them telling us to do.\u201d Jake whispered, calmly as the big guard moved within inches of the wall, snorting. The guard turned, blasted a hole in the ceiling with his gun and charged back into the hall. \n\n*They heard him blasting the door of the next room open.*\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve got this one on a signal blocker and there\u2019s not much time.\u201d \n\nThe girl turned and ran to a corner, where an iron hand rail rose up out of the floor in a curve. She disappeared through the floor and as Jack followed, he found a narrow, spiraling stair that led below. \n\nHe lost his footing and slid down the stairs, narrowly missing the girl. She stood in the room below, with ear to the door that led into the hall.\n\n![enter image description here](https://s16.postimg.org/90derv079/spiral_stair.jpg)\n\n*Jake followed close behind. The girl with the violet eyes opened the door and stepped out into the hall with the awakened Nosher right behind her and Jack bringing up the rear. Jack had no idea what to do next, but the girl seemed to be in her element, and willing to help.*\n\n**Hopefully, she was not leading them into more danger.** \n\nHe followed her past one door, and into the darkened room where they had first started. It was empty, which could only mean one thing. The Noshers who had recently occupied it were upstairs right now with the ugly guard. They were looking for Jack and the others and would soon head back down.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we just get out of here?\u201d Jack said. He stood with his back to the wall and the door opened a crack so that one eye could see down the hall toward the upper stairs.\n\n\u201cNot without these,\u201d the girl walked to where the guard had been and pointed up at the weapons, suspended above. She ran a hand along the doorframe, \u201cIt ought to be along here somewhere.\u201d She said.\n\n**\u201cWhat is?\u201d Jack hissed, shifting as her body pressed against his.** \n\nShe ran her hand along the top of the doorframe. He froze; she smelled good. It had been a long time since a girl had gotten this close to him, junior prom, in fact. He did not have a lot of time for dating with his work schedule. \n\n*To top it off, the smell of burnt fries that clung to him even after an hour in the shower was hardly an aphrodisiac.*\n\nThe girl put one hand on his chest and stood on tiptoe, pressing tight against him. \u201cOh, don\u2019t kid yourself; you just happened to be in my way.\u201d She laughed, scornfully, and pressed a hidden button at the top right corner of the door. Weapons rained down with a crash, and she quickly chose two handguns, handing one to Jack. \n\nShe pressed the button again, and the remaining weapons zipped back up into position. Jack had to grip the gun in his hand firmly to keep it from joining them.\n\n![enter image description here](https://s13.postimg.org/xp1l7jjyv/guns.jpg)\n\n**\u201cElectro magnet,\u201d she said and opened the door, moving out, weapon first.**\n\n\u201cI knew that,\u201d Jack said. He flattened himself against the hallway wall, like a TV detective. The magnet had occurred to him, but in his addled state, he had not really grasped the concept. Mostly he just did not like the idea of her being smarter than he was. \n\n\u201cKeep up\u201d he hissed to Jake, who had managed to grab a revolver.\nThe three moved quickly down the hall and turned toward the front door. The two roaches Jack had seen earlier, peered out from either side. \n\n**They had weapons leveled in his direction.**\n\n*The girl crouched and moved forward as if she were still a Nosher. It worked. Jack followed suit, and Jake did his best. His human consciousness was getting stronger by the minute.* \n\nHe had even started getting color back in his cheeks, and Jack was beginning to notice that the man seemed oddly familiar, the more human he became. \u201cCould be a side effect of this Nosher thinking,\" he guessed.\n\n\u201cThey're right behind us,\u201d the girl hissed to one of the roaches. \u201cBlast the next thing that comes down those stairs, you got me?\u201d \n\n**The bug clicked and hissed.** \n\n*Jack assumed it was a yes, because the two giant insects moved in and took up positions on either side of the hall.*\n\nJack bolted out the door and was relieved to see the Rabbit zip up just in time. Phineas sat behind the wheel, and the Things were nowhere in sight. Behind them, they heard the roaches open fire, and then a huge blast echoed down the hall. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s13.postimg.org/4klau8zdj/phin_rabbit.jpg)\n\nA gust of wind barreled out the door, raining cockroach guts over the three escaping figures. Jake stumbled, and Jack picked him up and shoved him into the back seat of the Rabbit.\n\nHe turned back to let the girl in, but she was gone. Phineas stood up on the running board, slapping the roof of the vehicle furiously. \u201cGet in the car! Let\u2019s go man!\u201d\n\n*By the time Jack had slid into the passenger seat, Phineas had the Rabbit patching out. They were up to top speed in a matter of seconds.*\n\n**\u201cFind a me a safe dime!\u201d Phineas yelled, standing as he worked the pedals and tried to see over the steering wheel at the same time.**\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack yelled over the whine of the engine.\n\n\u201cDime, a dimension, get us out of here.\u201d Phineas pleaded.\n\nJack opened the glove compartment and fiddled with the controls, but nothing happened.\n\n**\u201cDamn, guess I have to do everything, Phineas grumbled, \u201chere, take the wheel.\u201d** \n\n*The Leprechaun ducked under Jack\u2019s arms as he grabbed the steering wheel from his position in the passenger\u2019s seat.* \n\nPhineas leaned across the stick shift, his feet working the pedals as he started manipulating the glovebox controls. Jack\u2019s view through the windshield changed every few seconds. It was making steering from the passenger\u2019s seat even more of a challenge.\n\n*Meanwhile, Jake hunkered down in the back seat. From where Jack sat, he was not looking so good. He wondered how much time they had left.*\n\nJack swerved to miss a slow-moving vehicle that had just appeared as they shifted dimensions. Finally, Phineas settled for one that put them on a narrow two-lane country road. \n\nThe town disappeared, replaced by rows of fences. Phineas braked and turned off onto the shoulder of the road, rolling to a stop.\n\nJack\u2019s heartbeat slowly returned to normal. Meanwhile, Jake sounded like he was winding up in the back seat, his voice rolling into a high-pitched whine, perforated with short puffs of breath, like a woman in labor on a late-night sitcom.\n\n**\u201cYou okay, back there?\u201d Jack asked, climbing out onto the shoulder.** \n\nJake launched himself out of the back seat, landed face down in a shallow ditch, and promptly lost the entire contents of his stomach in a single \n\n\u201cralph\u201d.\n--------\n\nJack turned away, pulling his elbow up over his nose to avoid the horrendous smell of vomit. Meanwhile, Phineas dove around the hood of the car and into the ditch, pawing through the puke as if he was panning for gold. \n\n*A few seconds later, he came up for air, triumphantly holding the thumb drive.*\n\nHe stood, wiping his hands on Jake\u2019s jacket, and then looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s past time,\u201d He said, pulling the transmitter from the man\u2019s neck. Jake lolled into the ditch; his eyes fluttered, and Phineas shoved Jack toward the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n**\u201cLet\u2019s go. We don\u2019t want to be here when they come to collect him.\u201d He said, climbing into the passenger\u2019s seat.**\n\n***Will Jake see the girl again? What about his Nosher friend, what becomes of him? Will they ever get the smell out of the ALICE? Stay tuned!***\n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

      "body": "## In this episode, Joshua Claiborne stands trial for violation of the First Law ##\n\n**\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa!\u201d Phil screamed, \u201cWhat the hell dude?\u201d**\n\n*The Reaper crumpled to the floor, arms flailing as Joshua rode it to the ground. Finally, the hands found the catches at either side of the helmet and popped it off. A black, shaggy head of hair emerged.* \n\n***If you've missed episodes, [visit my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr) to catch up. Be sure to follow  me for updates in your feed!***\n\n\u201cEmil?\u201d Stella said, \u201cMeet Joshua. Are you okay?\u201d\n\nEmil, the Reaper suit\u2019s operator laughed, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine, but that was awesome! Can you teach us that?\u201d\n\n\u201cMan! Now I have to rebuild this helmet,\u201d Phil held up a small remote. \u201cAll I had to do was push this button,\u201d he said, pressing it, as the suit powered down. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018nerve\u2019 bundle that controls these things motor skills is on the very top of the skull, under a thin piece of sheet metal, puncture it, it collapses. You didn\u2019t know that?\u201d Joshua said. \n\n\u201cWell, it appears we may need you more than you need us,\u201d Stella said. \u201cSo, just say the word and we\u2019ll get you where you need to be. Meanwhile, my team will be working on your son\u2019s location.\u201d\n\nJoshua dropped the letter opener and walked to the stairs, \u201cFine, whatever you need to collect from my meeting, get it. Now, who\u2019s driving?\u201d With that, he walked up the stairs, he had no more time to waste. \n\n**The Mapleton courthouse sat on a hill in the center of the town, overlooking the area around for miles.** \n\n*Joshua insisted that the team Stella had sent stop 5 miles out and allow him to ride in on the electric trike alone, while they observed the meeting from a distance.* \n\nHe carried the tiny remote in his shirt pocket, a gift from Phil. \u201cThat\u2019s my only prototype, so don\u2019t lose it,\u201d he\u2019d said. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s12.postimg.org/siuqjuiz1/Untitled_36.jpg)\n\nFrom the end of Main Street, looking up toward the courthouse, Joshua counted at least six reapers. He wondered how far the signal from the remote would travel. \n\nHe thought about pressing it now, disarming his enemy, then walking in, but he\u2019d still have to deal with the six drivers, if they managed to escape the suits. \n\nBesides, Stella seemed to think there was some secret they were going to give away, although Joshua couldn\u2019t imagine it. \n\n*He checked his watch, ten minutes until his scheduled time and while he knew better than to be late, he had no intention of giving the Consensus one more second than he had to.* \n\nThe trike spun it\u2019s tires on a patch of loose gravel as he started back up. He decided a quick approach was best. He charged up the hill, jumping the \u201cMayor\u2019s\u201d parking barrier and rolling up to the foot of the front stairs, he cranked the accelerator and the trike rose up on its back wheel, popping the two front wheels, over the bottom step. \n\nThe machine had more than enough power to climb the steps and Joshua skidded to a stop outside the courthouse door. He stopped and turned back toward the town, the six Reapers swarming toward him up the steps. He powered down, swung his leg up and over the bike and opened the door. \n\n**The Reapers followed him into the hall as he approached the court room.** \n\nThe Magistrate sat behind the judge\u2019s bench and Joshua couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the insult to the very concept of actual justice that this thing represented. \n\n\u201cJoshua Claiborne, appearing as requested,\u201d Joshua said, standing directly in front of the Magistrate. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s12.postimg.org/6h4lvyh7x/judge.jpg)\n\n> \u201cYes, Mr. Claiborne, have a seat,\u201d A woman\u2019s face, projected on the face shield of the Magistrate said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather stand,\u201d he said. \n\n> \u201cSuit yourself, may we have the room, please?\u201d she said, looking toward the reapers that had entered the back doors of the courtroom.\n\nThey left quietly. \n\n> \u201cMr. Claiborne, you\u2019re charged with violation of the first law, in so\n> much as you have encouraged and joined in the activity of settling\n> outside of Consensus approved areas, acted outside of the legal\n> jurisdiction of the council and on more than  one occasion, acted\n> against the best interest of Consensus, including attacking duly\n> authorized Magistrates in the course of their legally binding duties,\n> how do you plead?\u201d\n\n**The woman looked at Joshua, peering over a pair of short, square spectacles, like some sort of outdated stereotype.** \n\n\u201cNot guilty, by reason of illegitimacy of the currently established government and its ensigns. I am not, nor do I choose to become, subject to your law. I stand judged as innocent by natural law, insomuch as I have not caused harm to another human in aggression, damaged or stolen property, nor unnecessarily restricted the liberty of any other person. I recognize no other responsibility to my fellow man,\u201d Joshua said calmly. \n\n> \u201cBe that as it may, Mr. Claiborne, we are not here under the auspices of \u201cnatural law\u201d but rather, under the Council mandated authority of the Consensus and its Magisterial Ministry, of which I am a part and I assure you, you are subject to,\u201d\n\nThe woman intoned, her expression one of almost sheer boredom.\n\n> \u201cCourt finds the defendant guilty and remands the subject for immediate judicial murder.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate raised its arm and brought it down on the bench with a solid thud, that echoed through the court. Joshua felt his heart sink as the Reapers reentered the court and moved up to surround him. \n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

      "body": "# I'm in the top 30 payouts again for the third week in a row and here's what I know. \n\n\n![enter image description here](https://s10.postimg.org/eqyn1nbm1/dolphins_money.jpg)\n\n**Want to join me in the top of Steemit earners? Here's how you can get more votes, more followers and earn more SBD.**\n\n## Write Quality Content!\n\nThat is all there is, there is no more. Now, once you've done this, you have to continue to do this until the cows come home if you hope to earn here. \n\n- You have to seek out and find your audience and speak to them! \n- You have to make yourself useful through voting and curating posts. \n- In short, to earn a $1000 SBD+ each and every week, Steemit has to become your job. \n\n**@EricVanceWalton** The top earner on Steemit this week, and two of three of the first weeks I was here, is in the enviable position of keeping his day job and saving his steem dollars. \n\n*If you read the interview with him (just search EricVanceWalton on Steemit, it's the first result, I think) You'll see that his plan is to save up the equivalent of two years salary, then quit and focus on his fiction. Good plan, mate!*\n\nSo, why am I not doing this? Well, a lean year as a freelancer ($40k instead of 80) means I'm catching up at the end of the year and thi is a good way to do it!\n\n**So, let's talk about what it takes to put together a payout post!**\n\n1. First, I write, or select a section of something I've already written. I shoot for 1000-2000 words. Anything over 500 is better. \n2. Next, I send my post through Whitesmoke editing, just to be sure I haven't left horrible typos. I don't spend a lot of time on this, and I don't get many complaints, just a few helpful suggestions, like, hey, learn to spell!\n3. Next, I handcraft illustration using internet photos and Photoshop. Rather than risk that (even if I share my source) someone will make me take them down. I composite and add filters to create unique pieces. It's fun!\n4. I dunp the post into Stackedit.IO and mark it up with bold text, etc, or, like now, I write in a program called Haroopad (It's free) It makes your post more fun to look at and easier to read. \n5. I choose my categories. THIS IS KEY! I look for categories that are 1. Listed in the topics catalog on Steemit 2. Have action! (some categories are basically dead) so, look for good payouts, recently. 3. Fit my post (I've said this before, but people will downvote spam posts in the wrong category)\n6. I add links to previous sections and a call to action asking for an upvote and follow to EVERY SINGLE POST!\n7. I create a short link, using Bitly.com and share it through relevant channels on Steemit Chat, in Steemit and writing Facebook groups and on my Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus profiles!\n8. I answer EVERY comment, unless it is obviously a bot, or an empty curator comment like \"nice article\" when the post is scifi. \n\n**Beyond this, I am experimenting almost daily with:**\n\n- Types of content, fiction, non-fiction, different topics, I try to use at least one of my four posts to try something new.\n- Times for posting. I need to get at least one day ahead so that I can make posts happen at specific times. \n- How many images, etc\n\n*As I have said, time and again, I cannot guarantee that you will experience the same results. I am a professional writer, who was already getting paid daily and in the habit of writing. But, this is as close to a \"formula\" as I have at the moment. *\n\n**Here are things I am currently experimenting with**\n\n- Category placement. I'm thinking I may need to shake  it up, try some new categories. Here's my theory, those with consistently high payouts have more whales watching them. \n- Audience participation posts. I did one yesterday asking for contributions, it did \"okay\" got some payout but not as much as I'd like. \n- Continued content versus one off, such as short stories and things like this. One offs tend to get more votes, but less payout. They also lead to follower growth. \n\n**In the past week, I've noticed a couple of trends I'm following in my posts**\n\n- Non-fiction posts, like this one, are good for garnering votes and seem to increase followers, but are not as good, for me, as my fiction. I think this depends on the topic, obviously, since the biggest payouts continue to go to non-fiction posts. \n- I get the most comments on dolphinschool and inspirational type posts. I love comments, it lets me know that someone is reading. \n- The first illustration in a post seems to have an impact. Something eye catching and colorful. I need to focus on this. Make it interesting, make  them ask, \"what is that all about?\"\n- Decent payouts are still coming in one big vote. I can have 100 votes with $5, or 50 votes with $200. While I'm glad they didn't change the vote limit, it does seem that the inequity is too vast still. \n- Payouts, overall, seem to have dropped a bit. This may be due to competition, or perhaps someone was voting for me when I started that has moved on to another new writer in an attempt to raise up good content? Not sure,  but I'm guessing this will get better as my followers increase. I notice Eric, again, closest thing to what I'm doing, gets 300-400 votes on many of his posts. I'm still under 200 votes most of the time. \n\n**So,that's it for me, love to hear your best tip! If you have one, share it in the comments. If this post reaches over $200 in SBD payout, I'll pay a reward to the best comment!**",

      "body": "On 20th April 2014 I released the 6th in my Dusty the Demon Hunter series. I've blogged about her before. She's an interesting young woman/demon. She rides a motorcycle, throws a mean Unicorn rope, hefts a beautiful blue-bladed sword and is what you might call a 'Kick-ass Teen'. I like her - a lot.\n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/Facebook/Dusty%20the%20Demon%20Hunter%20%20coming%20soon/dcd3432e-022d-49c5-8661-984ef3a8fa45_zps2ozflu2x.jpg\n\nI remember the first time I 'met' Dusty. I was sitting at my computer one Saturday evening and it was almost as though she came in, sat right by my side and began to dictate her story to me, the tale came to me so easily.\nBefore the evening was over, I'd done almost 8,000 words and I had ventured into a whole new aspect of writing, one that I never thought I'd be able to write - Young Adult.\n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/d26ee2c8-94ae-486b-927d-9209e8a0c389_zpsmv78jn1p.jpg\n\nThe first scene is rather steamy and I was very worried about whether it would pass for YA - my daughter said that it most definitely would NOT be suitable for teens so I calmed it down a little.\n\nAfter six stories about Dusty and her adventures, I've begun to think about a full novel about her. I think I can pull it off because there are a lot of demons in the world for her to be dealing with. I've got it all mapped out in my head. There are going to be a few more short stories involving the Demon Hunter teen but while I'm writing those, I'll also be writing her full story, with a good back-story to go with it.\n\nSo far, in the stories I've yet to put here on Steemit, Dusty has met an incubus, another half demon teen, harpies, vampires, Santa, a doppelganger or two, goblins, a cacodemon, mega-maggots and the devil himself. Who knows what's going to be in Dusty's future? The only thing I'm certain of is that she's never going to lead a dull life.\n\nPerhaps another release for her soon? We shall see.\n\nI've included the first part of Dusty's first story, just to whet your appetite so to speak.\n\n**She felt him approaching her from behind \u2013 as he always did. She was tense with excitement and shaking as he got close enough to touch her. The first touch from him was electric and her skin tingled wherever his fingertips stroked. His lips brushed her neck and she closed her eyes and leaned her head back on his shoulder.**\n\n**His arms snaked around her and folded her into his embrace. His lips were replaced by his teeth on her tender and sensitive neck; the nips were gentle yet insistent. His breath became laboured as his passion rose to match hers and he pressed himself against her. She could feel his excitement and she gasped. Her mouth opened to allow her panting breath an escape route and she moaned involuntarily.**\n\n**He stopped nibbling but held his teeth close to her neck, his tongue flicking out between them as he listened to her sighs. She was impatient for him to re-start his seduction but he knew that he was in complete control and he made her wait.**\n\n**His hand went up to her throat and gently traced from her chin down... the tension was excruciating and almost beyond her endurance. She wanted to take his hands and place one on her breast and the other between her legs but she seemed unable to control her limbs. Her hands and arms were immobile and a fleeting thought crossed her mind: \u201cOh no, not again!\u201d**\n\n**With that thought now embedded in her mind, his caresses and strokes became more invasive and she still could do nothing but moan her passion. Her mind was screaming her protest but her body, her treacherous and lustful body was urging him on!**\n\n**As he laid her down, she closed her eyes because she did not wish to see the person that was pleasuring her and yet violating her night after night in her dreams. She knew that he was aware that she was protesting inside her mind. He knew that her free will was locked away in the dream-state. He knew and he took full advantage of her instincts to mate.**\n\n**As he lowered his body onto her, she gasped again for his flesh was ice cold, almost painfully so. She could not move her arms to stop him but it seemed that her legs were under no such restrictions; they wrapped themselves around him.**\n\n**He was the consummate expert in seduction and he controlled himself perfectly. The rhythm was steady but exquisitely slow. He continued to work his magic upon her and she wrapped her suddenly movable arms around his neck to pull herself up, close to his body.**\n\n#curie #minnowsunite",

      "body": "**How This Book Works**\n\n> As a man thinks in his heart, so is he- Ancient Proverb\n\n*Einstein said that continuing to do the same thing and expecting different results was the definition of insanity.* \n\nThis guide is designed to help you open up your imagination and change the way you think. Each chapter is written to help you reach a specific realization that is needed to progress to the next level. Many of them may be things you have already recognized in your own experience, some will be new.\n\nAt the end of each section you will find specific action steps, with suggestions for free services that will help you achieve the results you want. If you choose, use this as your business plan and follow it to a T, but I really intend it to be a set of guidelines to show you one way it can be done.\n\nFollowing the work steps is a written affirmation. These are designed to be read aloud, with one section being read every day for ten days. Read each three times, once immediately after waking up, once after your midday meal, and once aloud before bed.\n\nEach new realization will include the basic elements of the realizations that come before. It is said that if something is repeated for a period of thirty days it becomes a part of your thinking, a habit, or way of seeing things. \n\nI suggest to get the biggest benefit from these ideas, that the final realization, covering the basics of all ten realizations be read for thirty days, and can be adopted as a daily reading.\n\nWhy? If you are like me, this sounds a little crazy at first. Why would reading something from this book, or any other, make such a change in the way you do things? The answer is, I don't know, and in fact I don't care, but the author of this book has used this type of mind re-education many times over and seen the results.\n\nIf you want to change your actions, to avoid insanity (according to Einstein) you must first change your thinking. As creatures of habit, many of our actions become automated, kneejerk reactions based on ideas and patterns of thinking that have been built up through study and life experience over years. \n\nTo introduce a radically new way of thinking (which I hope this is) you need to interrupt the current thoughts and replace them with something new.\n\nThat, or it's magic, whichever, but I will give you this: Anyone who can prove that they have followed the reading program previously suggested and has seen absolutely no benefit in their business lives, can have their money back.\n\nOne word on the concept of \"realizations\". \"Confessions\", \n\n\"Affirmations\" and a host of other terms have been used through the years to describe positive verbal reinforcements. What we are after here is something a bit deeper. We want you to recognize things that you already know and put them into practice to \"realize\" them.\n\nRealization: noun 1. the making or being made real of something imagined, planned, etc. 2. the result of such a process\n\n\nThe First Realization\n---------------------\n\n**Alone You Are Powerless**\n\n![enter image description here](https://s21.postimg.org/t1f62p9dz/Untitled_29.jpg)\n\n*\u201cNo man is an island.\" Poet, John Donne*\n\nYou are a self made Business Ninja! You worked your way through business school. Pulled yourself up every rung of the corporate ladder. Studied hard to gain the skills you needed. Worked nights stocking shelves to pay off your student debts and finance your first business.\n\nYou glide through markets with silent stealth, separating competitors from would be customers, and winning them over to your way of doing things like a sales assassin, and you have no one to thank but yourself for your success. You earned it, and no one can take credit for your accomplishments. Right? \n\n**Maybe, but then again...**\n\nAlthough Ninjas are always depicted as the lone warrior, sneaking into the enemy stronghold solo to carry out their dangerous missions, no one ever learned to disappear into thin air, throw Ninja stars with deadly accuracy, or escape from enemy clutches unscathed, without a teacher. \n\nNeither can you. But it isn't enough to know, or even understand this. A realization is a much more powerful experience, and it is squarely at the heart of your rise to Networking Ninja mastery.\n\nBefore you begin your training, let's talk about what this realization will mean to you. First, it should not be a hopeless thing, it is not meant to belittle your own accomplishments, or cast doubt on your skills, abilities or talents. \n\nThose are yours, you worked hard to achieve them and you are rightly proud of your accomplishments. We will talk more about those later when we get to the 5th Realization, the realization of what you have to offer.\n\nWhen I was forced to leave the comfort of my theater academy, a job that I had held for fifteen years, due to the pressures of the housing market collapse in 2008, it was scary. I realized that I had no real connections in business. \n\nSo, I found a friend who had been working on making connections in the business networking community in our city and asked him to introduce me to networking. It was one of the best decisions of my life. He needed my creativity and communication skills, I needed his people and computer skills, together we formed a formidable team that neither of us could have built alone. \n\nSo, here is where it begins. To really appreciate how much you owe your success to others, sit down with a pen and paper, or fresh word processor document and laptop, whichever works best for you, and think back as far as you can remember. \n\n*Begin a list of your accomplishments. Make this as detailed as possible. Start with things like, learning to read, or ride a bike. Move on to your first championship baseball game, or orchestra award, listing every accomplishment up to and including your current job or business. Everything that you have ever done well at.*\n\nOnce the list is complete, go through each item on the list and name at least one person without whom that item would not have been possible. Try to recreate the web of acquaintances and relationships that helped make you into the woman or man you are today. \n\n> Focus on the positive, there is plenty of time in life for regrets and bitterness, this is a time to be thankful.\n\nPick a few of these people, the ones that really stick out and write just a couple of sentences explaining to them their contribution to who you have become. Remember, stay focused on the good about you. There are plenty of people around who will remind you of the bad.\n\nNow read these aloud to yourself, thinking through each of them and the difference they made, how each opportunity led to another, how each relationship moved you forward, prepared you for something new, opened a new door.\n\nAs you do this, allow the fabric of your life to unfold inside your imagination. Follow all the little forgotten paths, like how the ability to ride your bike led to your time at the library, or the comic book store, or  made it possible for you to take your first job. \n\nSee how the influence of people who were willing to teach you and help you, recommend you for jobs, and build into your life made it richer. Don't allow yourself to delve into their motives, it is not useful. Stay on the positive. \n\nAllow this to continue unfolding until you feel you have a picture, a snapshot of the influences in your life and at least some of what they meant.\n\nQuietly, in your mind, begin to remove these influences from your life one by one and see what is left. See how one missed opportunity erases others, erases experiences, erases relationships. Allow yourself to feel that loss. \n\nIf you are honest, you will probably find that there is little you can truly take credit for, except perhaps those things you have helped others accomplish. This feeling, which hopefully contains equal parts gratitude and humility, this is the realization of how powerless you would be if you were truly alone in this world. \n\nThis feeling can lead to good things. We can only truly be our best selves when we allow others to invest in us, and we, in turn, invest in them.\n\nFrom this realization you can begin your quest for Steemit Ninja-ness. Now that you see how valuable connections are, you will begin seeking them out. Not just for what they will add to you, but what you can add to them as well. This realization of powerlessness will empower you to build the network you need to build the life you have been dreaming of.\n\nAfter a month or two of building on our casual acquaintance, James and I had a talk. We decided to partner up on a business idea. I would supply his skill with words, while James would bring his web development skills to create something that would be greater than the sum of its parts. That idea would have to wait, because someone else was waiting in the wings to bring an even bigger idea into focus for us.\n\nThe First Realization\n---------------------\n\n*(to be read as described)*\n\nAlone I am powerless\nWithout the aid of those who have gone before, and are walking alongside, my success will be impossible.\nEven the simple act of planting a seed was proceeded by the planting of another.\nI am powerless, but not hopeless and the realization of my powerlessness brings no fear.\nLife will provide exactly the right resources at exactly the right time if I am open to their arrival and unafraid to accept them no matter the source.\nMy powerlessness brings me a sense of peace, because I am powerless even to fail on my own.\nWhat business can succeed without customers?\nWhat student can learn without teachers?\nWhat builder can build without materials?\nI will adopt an attitude of gratefulness to those who have been my teachers.\nI will accept with humility the resources that others bring to aid in my success, even when the price is paid through my own labor, for I recognize that without them, my labor is useless.\nAlone I am powerless.\nBut around me, in front of me and behind me are all the abundance of the universe, and I am not alone.\n\n## Look for the upvote button below.

      "body": "## In this episode,  Joshua meets the residents of New Switzerland ##\n\nThe trike had driven through most of what was left of the night, arriving in a small town just as the sun was rising. Joshua had been asked to wear a blindfold, which he calmly accepted, knowing he would have done the same. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s22.postimg.org/u7hvwg1xd/New_switzerland.jpg)\n***If you've missed episodes, [check my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr) to read them. Be sure to follow me for updates in your feed. ***\n\nNow, as they stopped, his two abductors, if that\u2019s what they were, climbed from the trike and pulled the lined pillow case off of his head, allowing him to breathe freely and feel cool air on his face for the first time in several hours. \n\nHe looked around, his eyes adjusting to the morning light. \n\nThey were parked on what looked like a village green, surrounded on four sides by low, two-story  wood buildings with shops at street level and neat rows of windows above the shop entrances and awnings. \n\nThe grass was cut. The street was swept, in short; the place looked lived in. \n\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Joshua asked. \n\n\u201cWelcome to New Switzerland,\u201d the driver said. He was medium height and build, mid twenties, with a sandy head of hair and a bottle-brush mustache. He lifted a pair of driving goggles to reveal brown eyes. \n\nHe smiled and helped Joshua from the sidecar. \n\nHis companion was decidedly curvier. She shook out a head of blonde hair as she removed the helmet. She was older. \n\nThe young man held out a hand, \u201cI\u2019m Braum. This is my mom, Stella.\u201d \n\n\u201cBraum? As in Stoker?\u201d Joshua asked, shaking his hand. \n\n\u201cMy husband was a fan,\u201d Stella answered. \n\n\u201cNo offense, but why am I here? I\u2019ve got a really pressing appointment today,  but I\u2019m guessing you know that?\u201d Joshua said, doing his best to mask any hostility. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d come along with them, a gut feeling; he supposed. \n\n\u201cWe think we can help each other,\u201d Braum answered. He led the way into one of the shops, a neat mercantile exchange, stocked with home wares and groceries.\n\nAs Joshua passed the shelves, he noticed prices labeled in SBD, \u201cSBD? He asked.\u201d \n\n![enter image description here](https://s10.postimg.org/s7bk027tl/girl.jpg)\n\nStella smiled, \u201cWe\u2019ll get to that, first, let\u2019s get some breakfast.\u201d\n\nThey walked through a door at the back of the shop and into a large dining hall, filled with a variety of  people. \n\nHe saw one Dweller he recognized from about a year ago, when he\u2019d needed help with a  generator at one of their settlings. He was a mechanic, big man named Timothy, with a bushy red beard.\n\n A few others looked vaguely familiar. He counted at least three dozen adults and a long, low table was filled with children at the back of the room. \n \nHe accepted a plate of fresh scrambled eggs and a hot cup of coffee and sat down at a table with Braum and his mother. \n\n\u201cI appreciate the breakfast, but you didn\u2019t snatch me in the dead of night, however you found me, just to feed me some eggs.\u201d Joshua put down his fork and pushed the half-eaten breakfast back from the edge of the table. \n\n\u201cSo, either tell me why I\u2019m here, or lend me the key to your scooter and point me in the direction of Mapleton, because what you may not know, Stella, is they have my son and I\u2019m not willing to take any chances where he\u2019s concerned.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to help with that. We have something of an understanding with the Consensus, and we think we can get you included in that,\u201d she smiled, sipping from her own cup of coffee. \n\nHad Joshua not been so focused, that smile would have been enough to get him to stay right here.\n\n\u201cWell, as charming as that sounds, it\u2019s been my experience that there is no understanding the Consensus, so, I hate to tell you this, but you\u2019ve wasted your time.\u201d He stood up from the table and pushed his chair in, wiping his mouth on a napkin, which he folded and tossed onto the table. \n\n\u201cNow, which of you can get me where I need to go?\u201d\n\nStella smiled, and Braum sighed as Joshua turned away from the table. He whistled shrilly and the room fell quiet. \n\n\u201cAll right! I need one of you to either take me to Mapleton, or at least show me where I am on a map and provide me with transportation!\u201d He said. \n\nThe diners paused, looked at him, then went back to their food and conversations. He was beginning to get pissed. \n\nBraum stood from his chair and laid what was meant to be a calming hand on Joshua\u2019s shoulder. The older man was in no mood to be \u201chandled\u201d. He grabbed the hand by the wrist, twisting it back with his right hand, until he had it pinned behind Braum\u2019s back. \n\nHis left hand shot up and grabbed the young man by the throat, forcing him back onto the table. \n\nThe room was suddenly silent, \u201cListen, friend, touch me again, and I won\u2019t hesitate to remove whichever part you use to do it with. Got me? I believe in non-aggression, but I\u2019d say I\u2019m way past justified to be more than a little hostile here.\u201d \n\nHe released Braum and raised his hands to show he meant no harm to anyone, then sat. \u201cFine, you hold the cards here. Since no one will help me, I\u2019m at your mercy, but understand, my patience is wearing thin.\u201d \n\nStella still smiled at him over her coffee. \u201cWouldn\u2019t have it any other way. We\u2019ve heard good things about you, and we think we can help.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve said that, I need specifics, now, not in an hour, or even five minutes. Why did you bring me here?\u201d Joshua said, his steely blue eyes meeting her fiery green gaze, unblinking.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re the one they want,\u201d she said. \n\nBefore he could respond, he felt the unmistakable touch of a cold steel barrel on his neck. Two large men had moved up beside him calmly. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d think very carefully about what you intend to do with that before you poke me with it again. Who is \u201cthey\u201d and why do you care so much about what they want?\u201d Joshua said, his voice almost a whisper as he leaned across the table toward Stella. \n\n\u201cOh, I do like you,\u201d she said. \u201cThey, is the Consensus and I care, because if we have what they want, they will give us what we want.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you kidnapped me to hand me over, just hours before I surrendered myself? That\u2019s a lot of work to go to. I could have saved you the trouble,\u201d Joshua snapped. \n\n\u201cNo, silly, we\u2019re not in the habit of giving things away, quite the opposite. Follow me,\u201d Stella led the way to a spiral staircase in the corner of the room. Joshua followed her down, while the two body guards followed closely behind him. \n\nThey dropped down below floor level and stepped into the most technologically advanced space Joshua had seen outside of a Caucus City since the Abdication. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s17.postimg.org/3qyy9g6u7/lab.jpg)\n\nThe walls were lined with monitors. On one he saw what he recognized as a satellite feed, on another was an aerial view that he was pretty sure was the compound they were in now, but from above, it was nearly invisible, as it blended into the surrounding topography. \n\n\u201cWhen I said we\u2019d reached an understanding with the Consensus, I forgot to mention, they reached out to us,\u201d she laughed. \u201cWelcome to my lair. From here we can monitor nearly everything the Consensus is doing in the North American states. \n\nWe were too costly for them, so they offered to leave us alone, if we'd return the favor. \n\nThey still think we've agreed. \n\nWith a little luck, we can find your son, but what I want to know is, why are they so interested in you? Phil, can you outfit my friend here?\u201d\n\nA short man with spiked up hair in a lab coat and black leather pants walked over with a silver case. He sat it on a nearby desk and opened it to reveal what looked like row after row of round fabric samples, about the size of a shirt button. \n\nHe selected two, then held them up to Joshua\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cThis is what you\u2019re wearing, right?\u201d the man asked. \n\n\u201cYou mean right now? Yeah. For the meeting, no, I thought I\u2019d get my tux from the dry cleaners,\u201d Joshua said, wryly. \n\n\u201cOkay, he\u2019s funny. I like that,\u201d Phil said. He squinted, then replaced one fabric dot and selected another. He positioned the two disks on Joshua\u2019s shirt front, so that they perfectly blended into the fabric and became undetectable, even from Joshua\u2019s perspective. \n\nPhil walked over to a bank of computer keyboards and tapped in a sequence, \u201cOkay, talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d Joshua asked, his voice, echoing back to him from the wall of monitors, as a view of the room, that was clearly from his shirt front\u2019s angle, filled the screens. \n\n\u201cI want to help you find your son,\u201d Stella said. \u201cAnd in exchange, I need you to \u201cwear a wire\u201d as they used to say. So, are you in?\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, what makes you think you can rescue my son, even with all of this?\u201d he swept a hand around the room, taking it all in. \u201cYou\u2019re still in hiding, or did I miss something? Second, what do you hope to learn from hearing me sentenced to death, because that is all that is going to happen in Mapleton today. You know that, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, obviously, we can\u2019t let you die,\u201d Braum said, from the bottom of the staircase. \n\n\u201cMy mother seems to have developed a bit of a crush on you, so your death is out of the question.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat, glad to hear it,\u201d Joshua said, sarcasm dripping from every word. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a technology that can stop the Reapers where they stand,\u201d Phil said. \n\nAs if on cue, a large blue Reaper charged into the room from some hidden doorway, headed straight toward Joshua. Joshua's survival instinct kicked in. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s11.postimg.org/pzp4fixc3/kill_bot.jpg)\n\nHe moved quickly, Leaping off of the nearby desk, snatching a letter opener as he went, he landed on the giant machine\u2019s shoulders and brought the bronze knife down hard, right in the center of its massive skull. \n\n***Was it a trap? Is New Switzerland really here to help, or has Joshua just ruined their rescue plans for his son? Stay tuned!***\n\n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

      "body": "## In this episode, Jack meets up with his creepy visitor and gets chased by giant possums! ##\n\n*Garbage covered the floor of the hall a foot deep, and a growing sense of dread overrode Jack\u2019s increasing comfort with his surroundings.* \n\n> If you've missed an episode, [visit my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr) to find them all, and be\n> sure to follow me for updates!\n\n**Whatever evil was; it was here, he could sense it.** \n\nHe took a deep snort, finding the scent he needed and raising the curiosity of a tall, skinny Nosher with purple hair, who immediately decided to mind his own business when Jack turned a steely gaze toward him and raised a single eyebrow.\n\n*Jack moved down the hall, sniffing at each door. Finally, he found what he was looking for and pushed the door open into the pitch-black room.* \n\nHe was aware of a complete lack of light. \n\n***Somehow, he could still see, with a slight, blue \u201caura\u201d hovering around objects and bodies, of which there were a lot.***\n\nNo one reacted to his entrance, except a few curious glances as he moved into the room. He found a corner and sank down with his back to the wall, getting the lay of the land. The room was stirring with Noshers, most were human, but several of them he could not identify, or even relate to something familiar. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s14.postimg.org/7wmy7ggqp/Untitled_15.jpg)\n\nThere was a large, muscle bound guard near the door. Jack had missed that on his way in. The guard had a menacing looking weapon hanging from a sling over its shoulder. It rested lightly in the creature\u2019s claw-like \u201chands.\" The guard seemed to be staring at him. Great.\n\nHe let his gaze move over the room; bodies writhed in piles, looking more like a den of snakes, or insects than anything else. In one corner, he finally found it. Sitting, very much like him, taking in its surroundings with a big, goofy grin across its once human lips, was his Nosher buddy from the Mad Cow.\n\n**Jack sniffed and knew in an instant; this was the one from the Mad Cow.** \n\nHe smelled faintly of processed cheese food and burned French fries, a smell that Jack had grown to know as homey. He looked different, here in this setting. He was decidedly less menacing, but Jack wondered if he still had his gun.\n\nThe guard moved, pointing his weapon at a newcomer who had just stepped into the room. The guard grunted and the newcomer reluctantly lifted his shirt, revealing a revolver. The guard snatched the gun and tossed it straight up overhead, where it clanged to a magnetic grid, well out of reach. \n\nThe whole grid was filled with knives, handguns and a few miscellaneous chains. \n\n\"No gun,\" Jack guessed. That was good.\n\nJack shifted along the wall, moving towards his intended victim. He took his time, hoping a plan would develop inside his Nosher addled brain. Nothing did. Finally, he was within reach of his target. \n\n**The Nosher looked over at him, in surprise. \u201cCrap,\u201d Jack thought, \u201che recognizes me.\u201d**\n\n\u201cDid you bring food?\u201d The Nosher hissed and sniffed Jack like a hungry dog. \u201cYou smell like food.\u201d\n\n\u201cFresh out,\u201d he said, then noticing the Nosher\u2019s disappointment, \u201cBut, there\u2019s food, up there.\u201d Jack said, lifting his chin to the ceiling.\n\n*The Nosher looked up greedily, slowly figuring out that Jack was referring to the next floor up.*\n\n**He crumpled to the floor, \u201cNot that hungry, not enough to risk that guard.\u201d He said.**\n\n\u201cWhy not, they need us, right?\u201d Jack was getting into character.\nThe Nosher laughed cruelly, \u201cThey need the keys. Us? They don\u2019t need us. They\u2019ll just make more.\u201d He turned to the wall and started picking at a run in the wallpaper.\n\n*Jack sat, quietly, wondering if it would work. He decided to try it again. He closed his eyes and imagined the guard asleep. He did not know how long he had been thinking it when a loud snore hit is ears, and he looked up. The guard had not moved, had not even closed his eyes, but there was no doubt, he was asleep.*\n\n\u201cCool,\u201d snarled the Nosher, \u201cI like you.\u201d He stood and walked over, waving his hand in front of the guard\u2019s face. Several nearby creatures motioned for him to stop, they shrank back, but the guard did not even blink.\n\nJack moved up behind the Nosher and guided him out of the door. Together they walked down the hall and toward the stairs up to the eighth floor. As soon as he was out of sight, he removed the case containing the blocker and syringe from his pocket. \n\n**He followed the Nosher who bounded up the stairs, sniffing hungrily.** \n\n*Jack unsnapped the case and slipped the signal blocker out.*\n\nThe upper floor seemed to be empty, which suited Jack\u2019s plan perfectly. The Nosher stopped a couple of steps ahead of him, presenting Jack with a perfect opportunity. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s17.postimg.org/z6p73cy67/Untitled_9.jpg)\n\nHe stabbed the transmitter into the pale skin at the base of the Nosher's neck. The creature snarled, then his eyes fluttered, and he looked at Jack with terror. Just as quickly, his eyes fluttered again and opened as tiny, confused, sleepy slits. \n\n*Jack stabbed the syringe into his arm and watched as the entire thing dissolved, drug and syringe, with a small puff of smoke, into thin air. The Nosher stiffened, breathed in with a huge sob and was instantly awake, and very, very human.*\n\n\u201cWhere are we? Are we still in the harvesting center?\u201d He asked, looking around. He seemed to relax as he realized there were no Noshers nearby.\n\n\u201cYes, we are still in the building where I found you. We have to get out of here. I have some friends who will help you.\u201d Jack said. He moved out into the hall; the man followed him.\n\n\u201cMy name is Ja-ake,\u201d he said, but he seemed unsure.\u201d How did you wake me up? I never saw any of us wake up.\u201d\n\n**\u201cI\u2019m Jack; let\u2019s stay quiet until we\u2019re out of here.\u201d** \n\nHe moved down the hall towards the Southeast corner. When he reached the last door on his right, he turned the knob and pushed it open. A window was standing ajar in one corner of the room. \n\nThe chute was there, exactly where the map had said it would be. Jack ran to the window, with Jake in tow and threw one leg over the sill. He turned back to help Jake in first. Jake balked halfway in and backed away pointing down the chute. \n\n![enter image description here](https://s11.postimg.org/e3ezyhqlv/Untitled_19.jpg)\n\nFrom below, Jack heard ripping and saw at least four sets of eyes, and as many mouths filled with angry teeth. As he watched, what looked like man sized possums tore into the side of the chute. They started up the side of the building heading straight up the only means of escape.\n\n*When Jack turned back, Jake was leaving the room. There would not even be time to imagine a solution, as he had downstairs with the Nosher guard. He ran out into the hall and grabbed Jake, ducking through a door about halfway down the hall.* \n\n**Footsteps pounded up the stairs.** \n\nHe shut the door behind them, and turned to see Jake standing staring into a corner of the room, frozen in place.\n\n*From the corner stepped the Nosher girl from the elevator, and Jack\u2019s heart almost stopped. He was afraid to let go of the door, but certain she would snarl and alert the guards or the giant marsupials that were making their way noisily through the window two doors down.*\n\nHe grabbed the girl from behind and clamped one hand over her mouth, to prevent screams. \n\nHe wrapped the other arm around her waist. Jake still stood frozen.\n\n\u201cLittle help here?\u201d Jack whispered hoarsely. Slowly, he realized the girl was not struggling. He slackened his grip on her waste and turned her around, \u201cIf I take my hand down, will you scream?\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s intense lavender eyes were crystal clear. She slowly turned her head, left, then right, keeping her eyes locked on his. \n\n**He removed his hand, \u201cSo, you\u2019re the one who smells so clean.\u201d** \n\nShe whispered, with a small grin. She bit the corner of her bottom lip, \u201cI knew there was another Aedapt here. Come with me.\u201d\n\n*The girl opened a small door behind her, leading into a closet. She reached through and twisted a coat hook; a concealed door in the rear of the closet rocked open.* \n\n**Jack reached back and snagged Jake by the wrist**. The three of them moved quickly through the back of the closet.

The rules follow the story, thanks for playing!*\n\nWashington polished the dash of his 2065 Chronohopper, looking at his wrist chronograph impatiently. If they didn\u2019t show in the next 20 segments, he was hopping, with, or without the damn jewels. As a Time Teller, it was his job to know \u201cwhen\u201d it was, in all times, and right now, it was late.\n\nThe Chronohopper was designed for intra-atmospheric light speed jumps, moving from one time to another, without changing locality. That made for a lot of limitations. For instance, like now. He was waiting on his expeditioners to return via historically unreliable 19th century ground transport with a collection of \u201cborrowed\u201d diamond jewelry that had an expiration date. \n\nOnce the diamonds had been retrieved from this time, they were to be delivered to a very impatient customer, who held the keys to the master chronograph, and could, at will, decide to send them spinning off into time, rather than being dragged back through the centuries to deliver the jewels in 2121. \n\nIt was a science, stealing from the past. The current crew was attempting something new, known as a parallel snatch. They transported back into to a location, but in a slightly off kilter dimension, so that, in their own dimension, the jewels were never seen as stolen to begin with. Getting caught, however, meant the same as it always did, only they would be stuck in a dimension that was not their own, in another place and time. \n\nThat\u2019s not what bothered Washington. His cut came from the crypto currency that would be transferred to his wallet upon delivery, and he knew that transporting items across dimensional lines was unpredictable at best. The diamonds might stabilize and last forever, or they might only be pretty to look at for a few minutes, up to a day, before slowly fading back to their original location on the continuum. He didn\u2019t really care, as long as he got paid first. \n\nThe client understood the risks, but would have a jeweler standing by to perform tests to ensure their permanency. The longer it took to get them back, the more likely they were to have problems. Finally, Fin turned the corner and headed toward the back of  the van at a dead run, Theo right behind him, and right behind them, half of the police force of London. \n\n\u201cHurry up Washington, fire it up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Theo yelled, tossing a satchel into the chronohopper as he and Fin crawled in, helmeted and buckled. Washington was ready. He checked the sync on his wrist, adjusted a single dial on the dash and hit the accelerator. The Chronohopper vibrated, it\u2019s appearance slowly turning transparent to onlookers, and then popping back into corporeal form at the other end. \n\nWashington removed his helmet slowly, it always took a segment to adjust to temporal displacement. They were in the right place, but something was off. He turned to find the customer, tied to a chair, a gun to his head, Wolf Fitzer holding it. \n\n\u201cToss the satchel, lads,\u201d the big man sneered. This was the third heist in the last seven that Wolf had boosted. It was getting to be a habit. He swore under his breath, he was buying a second master chronograph with his next good haul. Position it somewhen safe, then a bad landing like this just meant a second hop to escape the problem. \n\n 1. Upvote the original post to enter the challenge.\n 2. Using the image as inspiration, write an original piece between 200 and 1000 words and add it in a comment on the original post.

      "body": "22nd August 2016 I joined Steemit because I happened to see a post from a friend I\u2019d made through a writing group on FB. I should remember the date because it\u2019s the day before my wedding anniversary.\n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/Facebook/Profile%20Pictures/14095737_10210206169492246_7904631527403284211_n_zpsoity38nu.jpg\n\nThree weeks on and I\u2019m very happy with my progress here.\n\nI have 134 Followers, I\u2019ve made 233 posts (234 with this one) and I follow 611 people \u2013 that number will be reduced dramatically because I intend unfollowing those who don\u2019t reciprocate. My rep has climbed from the start-up 25 to a heady 56 (let\u2019s see if I can crack 58 by the weekend).\n\nI\u2019ve made some Steem (Power and SBD too) and I\u2019ve invested some. I\u2019m not quite breaking even yet but it won\u2019t be very long before I do, I\u2019m sure. From a startup of 3STEEM my account is now worth GASP $313.51 \u2013 that\u2019s not a bad effort.\n\nI suppose this is a way of tracking my Steemit \u2018career\u2019 and the best way I can think of is to document where and when I started so when I look back, I\u2019ll be in a better position to work out if it was all worth it (I think I\u2019ll come to the conclusion that it was).\n\nFB is now second to Steemit and my writing productivity is climbing. Last night (this morning) I actually woke up and wrote something down for use later. That hasn\u2019t happened for a long time.\n\nI\u2019ve recommended a few people come and join up and so far, at least five people have accounts because of that recommendation \u2013 I don\u2019t know how active they are though.\n\nI honestly cannot think of a downside to the #Steemit experience. There\u2019s no back-biting, snide or nasty comments and the only niggle I\u2019ve had is the flagging incident but I believe that user has left.\n\nI\u2019ve even made some enquiries into Bitcoin mining so we\u2019ll see how that goes.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not going to be able to say to my husband: \u201cPhone work, tell them you\u2019re never going in again. Pack up your suits, get your coveralls on, the only thing you have to do all day, every day from now on is potter around, doing your thing.\u201d Any time soon because of this, but I\u2019m sure stranger things have happened.\n\nSo, here\u2019s my Time Capsule \u2013 where I was on 14th September 2016 \u2013 I wonder where I\u2019ll be in a year\u2019s time? In five years\u2019 time?\n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/Facebook/Profile%20Pictures/13407041_10209522908131139_285235708089558338_n_zpsy9d69kh5.jpg\n\nThen\n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/Facebook/Profile%20Pictures/13096089_10209272291865889_3824208802101477338_n_zps19t7jcyr.jpg\n\nNow\n\n#Steemon Steemians! Onwards and upwards!",

      "body": "## In this episode, Joshua gets new about his son and prepares for his trial.  ##\n\n*Joshua spent the ten days after his son\u2019s abduction planning for his possible removal from Dweller life, which was made more difficult by the forced isolation. He refused to enter the settling, staying in a small jobsite trailer about two miles from his tribe and conversing via radio.* \n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/88b47aae05.jpg)\n*** If you've missed episodes, find them all on my blog. Follow me to receive updates in your feed!***\n\nEugene, John, Adam and Darian had also been out to him on several occasions and had reached out to Kevin who was on the lookout for Joshua\u2019s son. \n\n**So far there hadn\u2019t been any leads.** \n\nThe four remaining leaders of the tribe had agreed with Joshua that nothing was to be said to Kevin about their whereabouts, or movements until they knew for sure he hadn\u2019t been the leak. They\u2019d devised a new password exchange, to be hand delivered among the tribes. \n\nIn the beginning of any conversation between actual dwellers, the initial question would be, \u201cWhat\u2019s my rations status?\u201d to which any dweller in the know would respond, \u201cRations status is green\u201d if it was okay to share information, \u201cyellow\u201d if the responder was unsure and \u201cred\u201d if they had reason to believe they were being overheard.\n\n*Kevin would be kept out of the loop for now and there was serious discussion about feeding him a steady diet of minor disinformation to find out if he was the leak.* \n\n**No one believed he was an intentional mole,   but, besides those in the tribe, the options were limited.** \n\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s your meeting,\u201d Adam said on the last night. \n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/88be94067f.jpg)\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201dJoshua smiled grimly. \n\nKevin had been able to find out that the meeting scheduled was indeed a tribunal and that one of the upper level magistrates was being rerouted to attend. A small convoy of armed guards was also requisitioned, so it was assumed Joshua would be taken into custody if he appeared. \n\nThey had done a scouting mission of the courthouse and made contact with another tribe in a settling just two miles from it, to let them know what was headed their way. They hadn\u2019t found anything useful.\n\n*It was midnight, but neither man was in a hurry to say goodnight. They\u2019d become very close over the months and Adam was concerned he would never see his friend again. Joshua\u2019s main concern was for his son.* \n\nAs Adam stood to leave, his radio crackled. \n\n> \u201cAdam, what\u2019s my rations status?\u201d Eugene\u2019s voice said from the other end.\n\n**\u201cRations status is green,\u201d Adam replied.** \n\n> \u201cKevin sent photos. It looks like Dax, being loaded off of the bio-transport at a re-education camp up north. He looks healthy, that\u2019s about all we can tell,\u201d Eugene said.\n\nJoshua sighed, it was good to finally have some news, \u201cEugene. Did he say more about where it was?\u201d\n\n> \u201cNew Kansas City area,\u201d Eugene answered. \u201cThere\u2019s GPS coordinates on the image, I\u2019ll work on getting it printed out for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how good that is to hear,\u201d Joshua said, tears welling up in his eyes. \n\n**\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d Eugene sounded ominous.** \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Joshua said. \n\n> \u201cKevin said to tell you there\u2019s no prisoner transport ordered for your tribunal tomorrow.\u201d\n\n*Joshua\u2019s stomach sank. It had been their experience in the past that if someone was being taken into custody, a transport would be ordered. If one wasn\u2019t, it typically meant it had already been determined that the defendant was to be judicially murdered.* \n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s not to jump to any conclusions,\u201d Adam said. \u201cInformation has been known to be incomplete before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say,\u201d Joshua answered him, turning out the small portable lantern and opening the trailer door to step outside. He looked up at the stars, for what might be his last time and sighed. \n\n> \u201cLook, Joshua,\u201d Eugene said, over the radio. \u201cI\u2019m only telling you because you said you wanted it straight.\"\n\n\u201cYeah, I know. Thanks, Eugene, you\u2019ve been a real friend. When you get my son back, you take good care of him, alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, the Creator\u2026,\u201d  Adam stepped to the door, but Joshua was gone in the darkness and he didn\u2019t dare risk a light outside of the trailer. \u201cJoshua?\u201d He said, quietly. \n\n> \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Eugene\u2019s voice asked.\n\n\u201cRations status red,\u201d Adam said, stepping out into the darkness as he flipped off the radio. \n\nJoshua had stepped out and into two very strong sets of arms, \u201cDon\u2019t make a sound, we\u2019re friends.\u201d A voice whispered in his ear. \n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/88c220cdf6.jpg)\n\nThe two strangers had led him around the trailer to a waiting electric  trike with sidecar and once Joshua was seated, they rolled silently into the tall grass, just out of site and waited. \n\n*Moments later, Joshua saw Adam turn the corner of the trailer and crouch down, looking for Joshua\u2019s silhouette against the night sky.*\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/88c4736355.jpg)\n \nAfter making a pass around the trailer, Adam gave up, \u201cEugene, come up, bring a light. We\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d\n\n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share! If you're not on Steemit yet, why not? You get free money for signing up! ##",

      "body": "Decimation of the Vampire clans was swift, brutal, bloodless, violent and unavoidable.\n\nAncient ones, revered and learned ones were destroyed. Weak, new Vampires were blinked out in an instant and so were the strongest, most ruthless and indefatigable vampires that ever stalked the earth. They were gone in one daytime. The void left by the absence of their shared voices over the bloodlink was deafening in its silence.\n\nSome of those that were left gave themselves to the sun because of the unbearable silence but those that survived felt something more. Not only did a deep serenity that they had never realised could be theirs descend upon their minds, so did the weight of the responsibility that had passed to them.\n\nIn one day their whole history had been wiped out, their council, the rulers, the wise and knowledgeable \u2013 all gone. Until the survivors rediscovered the archives where the ancient tomes were stored, the records of Vampire history were effectively gone.\n\nThose that were left would have to make their own way for a time. They could each hear the faint and forlorn voices over the bloodlink but had no idea who the others were or where they were. They could be scattered across the globe for all they knew and it could take months, if not years to find every one of them.\n\nAs it turned out, they were not so very far flung.\n\nAs the vampires went to their enforced rest for the daylight hours, little did they imagine that when they awoke nothing would ever be the same again.\n \nSilvanus was in exile. He had been banished by the council, to the \u2018arse-end of the planet\u2019 as punishment for his defiant attitude towards Clara, his maker.\n\nHe had been turned by her purely because of his looks. He reminded her of a lover she had when she was human. She was not attractive to him visually; he preferred a little more \u2018meat on the bones\u2019 rather than the scrawny consumptive figure that she cut. There was a good reason for her resembling a woman suffering from consumption \u2013 before she had been turned, she had been dying from the wasting disease.\n\nSilvanus was dismayed to awaken from what he imagined was a hell of a hangover to find that his life had been cut short and there was no returning to his family.\n\nHe lamented his loss and quickly came to hate the one that had stolen his life. He also blamed himself for not appreciating what he had when he had it. His wife and children were probably better off without him he realised and though he was reassured that they would not fall into destitution, he was angry with himself for not working harder at his family life but instead sinking himself into oblivion every night to not care if there was enough money left to feed his beautiful wife and children.\n\nSilvanus became a vengeful spirit on the streets of Rome. His new bloodlust was put to immediate use and he was not interested in hiding the corpses he created. He would feed from wealthy looking men or women, steal their valuables and leave the spoils at the door of his old home.\n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/Facebook/Profile%20Pictures/dde8f7d7-24e6-4700-91bb-a6d65792d833_zps7najxgeg.jpg\n\n\u201cYou will be the death of her,\u201d his maker told him. She stood at the corner of what had once been his street, watching him as he deposited the night\u2019s spoils at his widow\u2019s door. Clara\u2019s arms were folded across her emaciated chest, her straggly hair was hidden under a lustrous wig and her face was a mask of fury. \n\n\u201cI have tried to teach you what you need to know, how to kill and leave little trace, but you ignore your lessons. I have told you that the jewellery especially will bring trouble down upon your little family and you ignore me, but look.\u201d\nShe grabbed his arm and though he would have thought that he would be far stronger than she was, he couldn\u2019t fight her off and she dragged him out of sight of the approaching soldiers.\n\nShe clamped her hand over his mouth and held him secure in her arms. He struggled with supernatural might but her own accumulated strengths were overwhelming and he was helpless as they watched.\n\nThe group of soldiers were instructed to batter down the door and Silvanus could only rage against the injustices of it all. If he had been allowed, he would have gone to his lost family's aid.\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t understand is that though his body hadn\u2019t been found, already his wife believed him to be dead \u2013 which he was. The sudden appearance of him would have terrified them all. He didn\u2019t realise it, but he looked like a corpse to human eyes. Silvanus had not listened to his lessons and he had not heeded advice. He didn\u2019t know how to use a \u2018glamour\u2019, let alone use the skill without conscious effort.\n\nHe had not thought about what he had become or how he would appear to others. He was the \u2018living dead\u2019 without any of the benefits.\n\nAs he watched his family being dragged off to their imprisonment and ultimate deaths, he collapsed in Clara\u2019s arms and she brushed his hair from his eyes. She bent his head to the side and began to kiss his neck.\n\n\u201cYou will soon forget them, my love,\u201d she said and sank her sharp fangs into his throat. His eyes glazed over in ecstasy as she pulled the blood from his veins. He murmured his pleasure in groans of passion and Clara allowed him to feed from her. It was almost as though he had forgotten all about his previous life as he sucked Clara\u2019s life force but what she didn\u2019t know was that he could feel his strength improving as he fed from her and he had an idea.\n\nSilvanus altered his attitude. He became attentive to Clara\u2019s whims. He pandered to her every need and he watched and waited.\n\nHe bribed a man to keep an eye on his wife and children in gaol and though he could do nothing during the day, he slipped to the gaol to offer more bribes to their guards.\n\nThe little family may be in abject terror and misery but at least they were not being starved.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know what he could do about their trial but he had an idea to perhaps continue with the corruption he had been using thus far.\n\nThe night after the trial he waited for his informer to come to him but he didn\u2019t appear. Instead, from the same direction that he usually arrived, Clara appeared. She wiped her mouth with one hand and he saw smears of blood across her arm. Her other arm was holding something out of sight, hidden around the corner of the building she was standing by. She pulled her arm into view and he saw that she was holding a victim in her hand. Clara dropped the drained corpse in a heap and Silvanus recognised his informer.\n\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d he asked in a quiet and shocked voice.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Silvanus?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you choose that man to slake your thirst this night?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no reason in particular. He was passing by, I was hungry...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou knew that he was bringing information to me about my family.\u201d\n\nClara looked at Silvanus, her eyes blazed in fury and his widened in genuine fear. She approached him at a speed that he couldn\u2019t follow. One moment she was standing away from him and the next she was nose-to-nose with him.\n\nHer voice was soft and sensuous as she spoke the words that drove a spike of ice through what was left of his humanity.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have liked his message, Silvanus. If you wish to see your wife and children one last time, you should be quick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Are they to be deported?\u201d\n\n\u201cDeported? For murder and theft? Oh no Silvanus. There they are.\u201d She pointed to an open space in front of where the market was usually held. Four bodies hung from a scaffold. One adult and three children and he sobbed as he realised what had happened.\n\n\u201cYou did this?\u201d he asked. His voice was less than a whisper yet her supernatural hearing heard every syllable.\n\nClara turned away from him as he collapsed into a crouch, sobbing.\n\nSuddenly he had discovered how to move as swiftly as she had just a few moments before and he surprised her. He caught her by the arm and almost took her off her feet as he whipped her around to face him. It was Clara\u2019s turn to be frightened. She had never known a new vampire with such strength. It had been borne from his grief and fury, a natural occurrence, not learned but discovered.\n\nHe surpassed his maker in strength, speed and agility and he didn\u2019t know how he had managed to keep himself from destroying her there and then \u2013 but he had managed and that was the only reason he survived to be banished rather than destroyed at the council ruling.",

      "body": "## You can take Steemit by stealth! Here's how! ##\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/84b3cba608.jpg)\n\n*This content is shared here by request. After reading my Realizations of a Networking Ninja, several of you mentioned that it might be cool to share the whole book, as it pertains to steemit, so, here is a rewrite of the 10 Realizations of a Networking Ninja, for Steemit!*\n\nThe Steemit Ninja Economy\n-------------------------\n\n> We all feel it, there is a change coming over our world. We are at one of those unique crossroads in history when changes happen so fast that they sweep all the pieces from the board and level the playing field.\n\n*The twentieth century saw the culmination of the industrial revolution making manufactured goods cheap, easy and readily available. This made it possible for corporations to take on a larger role, with companies reaching enormous sizes, many times larger than the biggest had been before.*\n\n**Then came the information age, with loads of data being disseminated at a tremendous rate, making it possible for anyone to learn anything they were willing to spend the time to understand.** \n\nThis came to a head with the invention and establishment of the public internet. Now, many times the data contained in the world's largest libraries is available at your fingertips.\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/84b6e604ac.jpg)\n\n*These two occurrences caused a consolidation of sorts in corporate terms with fewer and fewer companies controlling more and more of the economic landscape. All the while, the vast majority of all workers were still self employed, or worked for \"micro\" businesses that employ five or fewer. By 2020, it is estimated over 50% of all workers will be freelance in some form.* \n\nThis created a huge bubble of wealth, resources, influence and power at the tops of the largest corporations. Anything was possible for them, **but the tide is turning**.\n\nThrough the creation of new media, as represented by the written, video, visual and audio media created by average users on Steemit every day, individuals are regaining their voice. And it is being heard. Social media is at the forefront of this. \n\nWhile much of  it is hosted by mega corporations, (Facebook was once expected to be the first ever trillion dollar company) it is driven by its individual members and their creative enterprises. \n\n*A simple video of someone's child or pet doing something humorous can garner a larger audience than a Hollywood blockbuster, or the latest TV smash hit!*\n\n**And it can happen overnight!**\n\n> In an environment where things are moving so fast, there is a serious advantage to being quick, agile, and flexible. Large corporations still have the edge when it comes to big budget production and promotion.\n\nIn the past most small businesses have been at a serious disadvantage, and competition between them for an ever shrinking local market has made it all but impossible for them to succeed.\n\n***I believe there is a better way.*** \n\nI think there is great opportunity to be seized by small companies and lone freelancers, if they are willing to change the way they see things. Those who are willing to see others, even in the same business, as potential partners to make lucrative deals with, rather than competitors to be eliminated.\n\nWhether we like it or not, the age of the giant corporation is coming to an end. It may not happen suddenly, but with the resources available to the average individual via technology, it won't continue to make sense to tie yourself to a giant corporation, limiting your options. \n\nIn fact, the last great hurdle is being legislated away through insurance law that will make good benefits as attainable for the self employed as they are for VPs in the biggest corporations.\n\nNot only can small companies and individuals access resources that were not available just a few short years ago, but the day is quickly coming when more goods will be sold online than through brick and mortar stores, if it hasn\u2019t happened already. \n\nThis gives steemers a level playing field when it comes to making an impression. We can even present ourselves better online than larger companies that may not understand the world of digital marketing.\n\nIf you have been in the online freelance community for any length of time, you probably already realize the wealth of talented people that own and operate their own businesses. In fact, you may consider yourself an underdog when it comes to competing with some of them. \n\n> I hope this guide will clear that up for you and open your mind to a\n> new way of understanding and thinking about business  relationships, one where your closest competition may become your greatest asset, rather than your greatest threat.\n\n*And seemingly unrelated businesses may become your greatest source of new leads.*\n\n**This new mindset is the mindset of the Steemit Ninja.** \n\nBy assuming the differences between you and larger companies are not a liability, but an asset, you can adapt your strategy as needed. You can mobilize your resources, undercut their high overhead and offer services and products that are competitive even against companies with resources many times what you can muster on your own. Welcome to the world of Steemit Ninjas.\n\nNinja VS Samurai\n----------------\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/84b992bf6d.jpg)\n\n*In feudal Japan, two classes of warrior existed, both from a common root. The noble Samurai were the warriors of the ruling class. They were stoic, and rigidly adhered to a code of honor and conduct that limited their ability to engage their enemy using flexible strategies. Samurai were born into their profession and were trained from childhood.*\n\n**Not all of the Samurai families agreed with their feudal overlords and a few decided to fight back.** \n\n> In response to the rigid code of the Samurai, the Ninja, as they were soon called, determined to use whatever means necessary to stop the warlike feudal lords from worsening conditions on the common people through war.\n\n*They would do whatever it took to prevent war, and promote peace, even if that meant strategic assassinations of leaders bent on warlike politics.*\n\nWhile the Samurai, much like the British redcoats, were predictable in their methodology and combat techniques, the Ninja would use any disguise, ruse, or espouse any belief to attain their goals. \n\nThey could often penetrate enemy lines, causing chaos and even winning battles against overwhelming odds because of their unexpected and unorthodox techniques.\n\nWhen we look at the current business climate, especially in networking, we see many parallels. Many business people hold to old, unspoken rules of networking that we feel can be unnecessarily limiting. \n\n - The Steemit Ninja is free to create relationships wherever they can\n   be found.   \n - The Steemit Ninja is free to give and receive referrals from any source. \n - The Steemit Ninja can change strategies at a moments notice to outmaneuver the competition and come out on top time after time.\n\n**This book will guide you in the way of the Steemit Ninja.** \n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/84bcbafd44.jpg)\n\n*Here are a few things you will not find in this guide.* \n\n - You will not find much in the way of formal business etiquette or practices. \n - I will not teach you everything you could have learned in an MBA course at Harvard but were afraid to ask, and \n\n**Why not? Because I don't know any of these things.**\n\n*Here is what I will teach you.* \n\n - I will teach you how purposeful relationships, even casual acquaintances can lead to contracts worth thousands. \n - I will show you how I used my Networking Ninja skills to start a lucrative career in online writing with almost no cash investment. \n\n> Through networking I now command writing fees of up to $150 an hour and you can do the same in your area of expertise!\n\nIn my next post, I\u2019ll share how this is going to work and give you your first lesson on the path to becoming a true Steemit Ninja. \n\nFollow my blog to have the updates automatically shared in your feed, leave comments in the questions and be sure to upvote the posts to keep them coming! I\u2019m so excited about sharing all of this with my Steemit family!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------",

      "body": "## In this episode, Jack enters another world, wrapped in his Nosher persona! ##\n\n**Thing Two sighed and shook his head.** \n\n*It was clear he was not impressed with Jack\u2019s intelligence.* \n\n\u201cI don't mean turning into a Nosher. Camouflaging yourself, to whatever surroundings you\u2019re in, like a Chameleon. One, this kid is not too bright.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, so now what?\u201d Jack noticed his voice sounded like the hoarse whisper of the Nosher. It creeped him out. \n\n**Thing One was right, weird.**\n\n*Thing Two pulled another small case from one of his many pockets. He wiped his mouth on his sleeve as he laid the case on the hood of the Rabbit and opened it.* \n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/82e15d9481.jpg)\n***If you've missed an episode, you can find them all [on my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr). Be sure to follow me for updates!***\n\nInside was what looked like a miniature meat thermometer. It had a digital screen about the size of a quarter and two silver probes stood out at the bottom. Next to it lay what was clearly a syringe, but unlike any other, Jack had seen.\n\n\u201cYou need to find the Nosher you saw last night. You\u2019ll know him by his smell.\u201d Thing Two explained.\n\n\u201cBy his smell?\u201d Jack sniffed; his sense of smell expanded.  He could distinguish each of the men in front of him by scent. \n\nHe could recognize them immediately. It was as if a digital image of each person were stored in his memory by his particular aroma. This must be how dogs thought. \u201cSo, what\u2019s with the gadgets?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve sniffed out your target, you\u2019ll need to attach this device to him. Put it near the base of the neck then inject him with this. The first is a neural signal interrupter. It will override the programming from the Shadoes. The needle is filled with an adrenal cocktail to wake him up.\u201d \n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/82e43cca5c.jpg)\n\n**Thing Two closed the case and handed it to Jack.**\n\nThing One continued the explanation, \u201cHe\u2019s more like you than you realize. He is human inside. Not all Noshers are human, or at least, not from your dimension; this one is. Once you interrupt the signal, he is going to come out of the trance but he is going to be like a coma patient, groggy.\" \n\n\"So, stab him with the syringe anywhere. The whole syringe will dissipate once you have injected the serum. It\u2019s like a caffeine-laced adrenaline shot. It will focus him, and his primary thought will be to get out of there, which is to your advantage. You need to get him out without stirring up trouble, though.\u201d\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/83053f286d.jpg)\n\n**\u201cThen what?\u201d Jack opened the case and started to pick up the transmitter.**\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t! Touch it.\u201d said Thing Two, covering the case with his huge hand. \u201cIf the probes on either of those come in contact with skin, we\u2019re done. It\u2019s the only set we have, and you just get one chance with these.\u201d He snapped the case shut and pressed it against Jack\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cGot it. Okay, so, I walk in, find the Nosher, inject him without being seen, and then just walk out?\u201d Jack asked.\n\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Phineas had the map opened on the hood again, and he brought up the building. \u201cThere\u2019s a remodeling project on the top floor. You will see a rubbish chute attached to one of the windows. It looks like it was in the Southeast corner the last time this was updated, but it could have been moved. Find it and jump through, we\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/830f99b7b7.jpg)\n\n**\u201cSo, once we have him, then what?\u201d Jack asked.**\n\n\u201cThen we literally beat the crap out of him. Not to put too fine a point on it, this could get messy. There\u2019s only two ends for that key to come out of.\u201d \n\n*Phineas seemed almost gleeful at the thought.*\n\n\u201cOnce we have retrieved the key, we\u2019ll send him back. It has to be done quickly. The neural signal interruption is temporary. Once they realize he is not receiving, they will try to track him. If they find us, it won\u2019t end well,\u201d Thing One said.\n\n\u201cWhat do I do if I get stuck in there?\u201d Jack asked.\n\n\u201cImagine a better situation. When you\u2019re in dimensional flux, you should notice an almost instant result,\u201d Thing One said.\n\n**\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Jack asked.**\n\nThing Two sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s like this, you imagine stuff, and it changes the environment around you. People do what you want, what you picture strongly enough just happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, this poor slob just goes back to being a Nosher when we\u2019re done with him? That kind of sucks for him! Can\u2019t we just keep him human?\u201d Jack asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely he would respond. The only way we know of to free one of them permanently is to kill the Shadoe that is hosting his soul.\u201d Phineas said sadly.\n\n**\u201cSo, is that hard to do?\u201d Jack asked.**\n\n\u201cKilling a multidimensional being with no known soul? Yeah, it's a little complicated; it\u2019s never been done.\u201d Phineas answered.\n\n*Jack swallowed; he felt as if a huge weight had settled on his shoulders. In the last twenty-four hours, he had left behind the only life he had ever known. He had taken a crash course in alternate realities.* \n\nNow the \u201cgood news\u201d was he might be the only person who could save everyone he knew from a life of Inter-dimensional slavery. Damn.\n\n\u201cWell, what are you waiting for?\u201d Thing Two asked, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get any easier. The longer you are in this area with those BEANS activated, the more likely someone is going to sense you. Then things are going to get a lot more interesting.\u201d\n\u2003\nJack looked at this group of strangers and hoped he was playing for the right team. Thing One, the only one that seemed to sympathize at all, patted him on the shoulder. \n\n*He turned and walked out of the alley and down the block. His body contorted into the almost spider like walk he had seen the Nosher use.*\n\nAs he approached the building, several creatures he could not identify crawled out of an alley and snorted at him. He growled back, remembering his dad\u2019s words to him once. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can get away with if you look like you belong and pretend to know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to have passed inspection. The creatures, all smaller than him, cowered and scuttled back into hiding. The structure had been built somewhere around the turn of the twentieth century. It had a yellowish brick, a little larger than modern house brick. \n\nEach floor had a neat row of wooden windows, arranged symmetrically across its face. He looked up. Somewhere in there was the thing he needed. What was it the Nosher had said? The \u2018key to the universe\u2019, somehow contained in a thumb drive. \n\nSloping brick walls framed the large concrete entrance steps on each side. Two enormous cockroaches slithered out of hiding and stood erect on either side of the door at the top of the stairs. Each was at least six feet tall. Nosher Jack involuntarily licked his lips. \n\nApparently, these would have been food under other circumstances. Both were heavily armed. They stopped him on the top step, frisking him with multiple pairs of legs.\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/8319b8d852.jpg)\n\nJack imagined himself walking past them. The small case stayed hidden in his pocket, somehow. They stepped aside and let him pass. It worked! \n\nThe huge glass entry doors seemed a little modern for the structure. As he entered the building, a wave of aromas billowed out, engulfing him. He sniffed, unsuccessfully at first. Then a thin note of twang caught his attention, and he followed it in, down a darkened hallway.\n\n*Half a dozen supernaturally large insects, a few humanoid Noshers and a massive dog-like creature moved in and out of doors along the hall. Some of them lounged against the walls. It felt familiar, but he was sure there would be no backup in black suits, if the jello hit the fan.* \n\nJack moved down the hall, led by his super-charged olfactory senses. A particularly heinous looking female Nosher climbed into the elevator at the end of the hallway. He was not sure his disguise would bear up under her scrutiny. He climbed stairs instead.\n\n*For the first few steps, his fully human self was repulsed. It took everything he had to maintain the illusion of belonging. He had a strong urge to run screaming from the building. As he progressed, he felt more and more at home.*\n\nPhineas' parting words whispered from a corner of his mind. \u201cBe quick, boy, the longer you stay like this the harder it will be to come back from it.\u201d He picked up the pace, taking two and three steps at a time. He made it up to the seventh floor. It was next to the last, according to his count of the neat rows of windows.\n\nHe turned toward a narrow entrance to a hall. The door hung useless from one hinge. A fat Nosher looked up from his station behind a folding table beside the gimpy door, motioning for him to stop. \n\n*The Nosher muttered to himself as he flipped through photocopied pictures on a clipboard. He seemed to find, or not find, what he was looking for and motioned Jack to continue.*\n\n\n## Look for the upvote button below. If you liked the post, upvote and share!

      "body": "**Please forgive me this one. I'm experimenting and this is a duplicate post but I *do* have a point, I promise**\n\nSteemit is like Facebook?\n\nSteemit is a social media, just like Facebook. Making a circle of friends from scratch, just like Twitter and Google, but getting paid for posts \u2013 revolutionary!\n\nYeah, you all know this, and I suspect that\u2019s the main reason most of us are here. I know a number of my friends are here because I told them about this place \u2013 Waves!\n\nJust like Facebook, I\u2019m finding I\u2019m spending a lot of my time online here \u2013 yep, Steemit has surpassed Facebook for me. I now check this out before going to my FB account.\n\nBut unlike FB, I don\u2019t have my \u2018usual suspects\u2019 to fall back on. \n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/Deadlier%20Beginnings_zpsnxoncmm6.jpg\n\nTo begin with, I wandered about, trying to suss it all out. I\u2019ve mimicked successful accounts (or tried to,) without anywhere near their success and I think that\u2019s what the problem is. I wanted to make this my job, but it\u2019s not as easy as all that.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DMichelleGentAuthor/\n\nOver in FB I have a few hundred core followers, my \u2018peeps\u2019 who always respond when I write a new piece for the new books I have coming out \u2018soon\u2019 - (Thank you for your patience, one really IS coming out at Halloween), but over here, tumbleweed\u2026\n\nI think the differences between FB and Steemit make it difficult for non-writers to get to grips with. Where over there you get a handy little Share button, over here it\u2019s got to be all your own work for at least the vast majority of the time. \n\nYeah, I have seen people getting rewards for posting Youtube videos but it\u2019s either their own video they put on Youtube first or the account gets one or two good payouts and then grinds to a halt as Steemians catch on.\n\nSteemit is more complex. I can spend a few hours just on writing one post, let alone figuring out which picture(s) would suit it best (most of mine are my own pics by the way).  FB is quick and easy, share this, like that, catch up with the gossip, what friends have been up to etc, and on we go!\n\nI don\u2019t think most people using FB actually have the burning desire to write, it\u2019s a way of passing on a few minutes a number of times per day.\n\nSteemit is not so cliquey, not so insular. The majority of the people on here are strangers and I have to appeal to them before they will come out and engage. That\u2019s a new one on me! I never went into the whole blog thing with any sense of regimentation, no strict posting every day or three times a week, come what may and that, I think may be somewhat detrimental to my Steemit experience.\n\nNOT that I\u2019m discouraged, nope, not a bit. I\u2019ve seen people ranting that it\u2019s not fair (really? How old are you?) and the Whales have an obligation to the minnows, but I do not subscribe to that train of thought.\n\nI\u2019ve had a few good responses and I\u2019m enjoying this platform. As I said in a previous post, I\u2019ll give myself until the end of October to see if it\u2019s viable and I\u2019m sticking to that. \n\nI suppose then, all I can do is follow people, keep making the posts (original content of course) and hope that I catch one of the fabled Whales I hear tell about.\n\nThis Steemit thing is in Beta mode yet and to be hanging onto the back of this train by the fingernails has to be better than climbing aboard in a few weeks/months/years when the Steemit Train has picked up momentum and really got going, and there are another five carriages added to the back.\n\nSo to the nay-sayers, I have one piece of advice: Suck it up, buttercup. If you don\u2019t like it here and you want to whine about how unfair all this is, try going out into the \u2018real\u2019 world and making a living. This brand new, shiny Steemit Train may have a few issues to iron out yet, but you can see the development guys are working on it.\n\nThe Whales of this world, not just Steemit, have NO obligation to help a minnow out and why the hell should they? Their idea, their courage to start it up, their initial investment, their reward, all the way down the line.\n\nThat is also not to say that the Whales, Dolphins, Orcas, Kraken etc that take a moment to upvote a post and send that one into the trending stratosphere are not appreciated, they are! Oh boy, my first post that hit payout \u2013 a whole $8 \u2013 had me celebrating! Actually, every time I get a payout I celebrate because, if I were to write all this on my personal blog or on Facebook, I\u2019d get $0 \u2013 nil points, zero, zilch, nada \u2013 sod-all!\n\nTo the Steemians behind the competitions and the projects to get the minnows a little recognition and reward, I say thank you! You\u2019re doing an awesome job! You\u2019re creating a society all your own where the minnows of today will pay it forward tomorrow and help out the new minnows when they have become dolphins.\n\nAm I going to give up on this Steemit thing because I\u2019m not making a wage?\n\nNope! I think I\u2019m here to stay.\n\nThis platform has seen more of my new writing than anything I could think of, for the longest time, to get my mojo flowing.\n\nYou see, I first published way back in August 2010. I followed up with the second in that series in April 2012 and another in October 2012. With a series of short stories (7 in total) to put at the side of that, I haven\u2019t done much at all where writing is concerned. \n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/cover%20pic_zps8loyajoc.jpg\n\nI set up a business to edit new authors\u2019 books which gave me the excuse to not write for myself \u2013 and that\u2019s what it was, an excuse.\n\nSo Steemit really has lifted me out of the Writer\u2019s Block I\u2019d wedged myself into.\n\nYeah, I think it\u2019s safe to say, I\u2019m sticking around.\n\nThank you.",

Because here on Steemit in the last couple of weeks, I've actually had the chance to write fiction and pay bills at the same time. \n\n**So, here's my prediction for what will happen.**\n\nNot much, really. \n\n - As I understand it, the same amount of steem dollars will be distributed each day so, the payout totals won't change. (I could be wrong, there's so much conflicting data)\n - I think the writers that share good content will continue to be rewarded. It may bobble a bit,  but I don't see the deck being reshuffled too much. \n - I intend to stick with my strategy, whatever happens, through the rest of this week, adjusting in small ways, if needed. \n\n## Easy come, easy go! ##\n\nIf, tomorrow, the site doesn't come up in my browser, I will still be the same guy I was a month ago when I \"randomly\" (thanks God, thanks universe) found the post that sent me down this rabbit hole. \n\n**So, what can I recommend?**\n\nSomehow, I've managed to rise to the middle pretty quickly, so I know a lot of you think I've made a deal with the devil to get it done, but my advice basically remains the same as it's been. \n\n 1. **Write quality posts!** Nothing can take the place of this!\n 2. **Stay consistent!** Although it's wearing me out at the moment, I intend to keep three to four posts a day on my blog. \n 3. **Interact with everyone!** Respond to every comment, upvote and comment on others work. \n\n**Here's the thing, the market defines demand. **\n\nIf there is an audience for your topic, or style, and you do it well, you'll get readers. Stay consistent long enough to find out. Too many writers on steem act like monkeys, throwing poop at the wall to see what sticks. \n\n - Post on your topic for at least a week consistently, before determining no one wants to read it. \n - If you need to experiment with something new, write a second, or third post, you can post up to 4x a day, without hurting your other posts. \n - Spell check your document and edit it. Don't expect people to wade through crap. Need help? Get a product like Whitesmoke, ($10) a month and it catches the worst of your mistakes for you!\n\n**So, I am nervous to see what response will be, but I'm not scared. **\n\nIf you are true to yourself, the world seems a lot less scary, because you're not afraid for being uncovered as a fraud. I know I'm a good story teller. I hesitated for years to share my fiction, for fear it wasn't good enough, but about two years ago I just decided to go for it!\n\n - I write stuff I want to read. \n - I don't worry too much about critics (most of them just pick on my comma usage anyway, so, screw, them)\n - I love to write and a lot of people tell me I should keep doing it. \n\n## So, what about you, are you scared? ##\n\n**I just keep saying, what's the best that could happen?**\n\nThey've said that there should be more middle priced posts, which is where I fall anyway. So, I'm just going to keep on tracking and see where the chips fall.",

      "body": "Steemit is like Facebook?\n\nSteemit is a social media, just like Facebook. Making a circle of friends from scratch, just like Twitter and Google, but getting paid for posts \u2013 revolutionary!\n\nYeah, you all know this, and I suspect that\u2019s the main reason most of us are here. I know a number of my friends are here because I told them about this place \u2013 Waves!\n\nJust like Facebook, I\u2019m finding I\u2019m spending a lot of my time online here \u2013 yep, Steemit has surpassed Facebook for me. I now check this out before going to my FB account.\n\nBut unlike FB, I don\u2019t have my \u2018usual suspects\u2019 to fall back on. \n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/Deadlier%20Beginnings_zpsnxoncmm6.jpg\n\nTo begin with, I wandered about, trying to suss it all out. I\u2019ve mimicked successful accounts (or tried to,) without anywhere near their success and I think that\u2019s what the problem is. I wanted to make this my job, but it\u2019s not as easy as all that.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DMichelleGentAuthor/\n\nOver in FB I have a few hundred core followers, my \u2018peeps\u2019 who always respond when I write a new piece for the new books I have coming out \u2018soon\u2019 - (Thank you for your patience, one really IS coming out at Halloween), but over here, tumbleweed\u2026\n\nI think the differences between FB and Steemit make it difficult for non-writers to get to grips with. Where over there you get a handy little Share button, over here it\u2019s got to be all your own work for at least the vast majority of the time. \n\nYeah, I have seen people getting rewards for posting Youtube videos but it\u2019s either their own video they put on Youtube first or the account gets one or two good payouts and then grinds to a halt as Steemians catch on.\n\nSteemit is more complex. I can spend a few hours just on writing one post, let alone figuring out which picture(s) would suit it best (most of mine are my own pics by the way).  FB is quick and easy, share this, like that, catch up with the gossip, what friends have been up to etc, and on we go!\n\nI don\u2019t think most people using FB actually have the burning desire to write, it\u2019s a way of passing on a few minutes a number of times per day.\n\nSteemit is not so cliquey, not so insular. The majority of the people on here are strangers and I have to appeal to them before they will come out and engage. That\u2019s a new one on me! I never went into the whole blog thing with any sense of regimentation, no strict posting every day or three times a week, come what may and that, I think may be somewhat detrimental to my Steemit experience.\n\nNOT that I\u2019m discouraged, nope, not a bit. I\u2019ve seen people ranting that it\u2019s not fair (really? How old are you?) and the Whales have an obligation to the minnows, but I do not subscribe to that train of thought.\n\nI\u2019ve had a few good responses and I\u2019m enjoying this platform. As I said in a previous post, I\u2019ll give myself until the end of October to see if it\u2019s viable and I\u2019m sticking to that. \n\nI suppose then, all I can do is follow people, keep making the posts (original content of course) and hope that I catch one of the fabled Whales I hear tell about.\n\nThis Steemit thing is in Beta mode yet and to be hanging onto the back of this train by the fingernails has to be better than climbing aboard in a few weeks/months/years when the Steemit Train has picked up momentum and really got going, and there are another five carriages added to the back.\n\nSo to the nay-sayers, I have one piece of advice: Suck it up, buttercup. If you don\u2019t like it here and you want to whine about how unfair all this is, try going out into the \u2018real\u2019 world and making a living. This brand new, shiny Steemit Train may have a few issues to iron out yet, but you can see the development guys are working on it.\n\nThe Whales of this world, not just Steemit, have NO obligation to help a minnow out and why the hell should they? Their idea, their courage to start it up, their initial investment, their reward, all the way down the line.\n\nThat is also not to say that the Whales, Dolphins, Orcas, Kraken etc that take a moment to upvote a post and send that one into the trending stratosphere are not appreciated, they are! Oh boy, my first post that hit payout \u2013 a whole $8 \u2013 had me celebrating! Actually, every time I get a payout I celebrate because, if I were to write all this on my personal blog or on Facebook, I\u2019d get $0 \u2013 nil points, zero, zilch, nada \u2013 sod-all!\n\nTo the Steemians behind the competitions and the projects to get the minnows a little recognition and reward, I say thank you! You\u2019re doing an awesome job! You\u2019re creating a society all your own where the minnows of today will pay it forward tomorrow and help out the new minnows when they have become dolphins.\n\nAm I going to give up on this Steemit thing because I\u2019m not making a wage?\n\nNope! I think I\u2019m here to stay.\n\nThis platform has seen more of my new writing than anything I could think of, for the longest time, to get my mojo flowing.\n\nYou see, I first published way back in August 2010. I followed up with the second in that series in April 2012 and another in October 2012. With a series of short stories (7 in total) to put at the side of that, I haven\u2019t done much at all where writing is concerned. \n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/cover%20pic_zps8loyajoc.jpg\n\nI set up a business to edit new authors\u2019 books which gave me the excuse to not write for myself \u2013 and that\u2019s what it was, an excuse.\n\nSo Steemit really has lifted me out of the Writer\u2019s Block I\u2019d wedged myself into.\n\nYeah, I think it\u2019s safe to say, I\u2019m sticking around.\n\nThank you.\n\n#curie #minnowsunite #robinhoodwhale",

We were in the Tap and Tumbler bar in Nottingham, England and we had gone there to watch one of our favourite bands \u2013 Exhibit A - play. It was November (I think) and the almost-Christmas spirit played a large part in everyone\u2019s good humour. The band played for almost three hours without a break. The audience were as exhausted as the band \u2013 we never stopped dancing.\nHubby and I had both been on a diet and had lost around 70lb between us and were pleased and proud of each other. At our ages \u2013 107 between us, losing weight and fitting into clothes we\u2019ve had for 20 and more years is quite an achievement, even though it took the best part of 2 years to get to that stage. \nThe jackets we were wearing in the picture have been with us almost all the time we\u2019ve been together and when we tried them on again after not being able to get them on, let alone zip them up, it showed what great strides we\u2019d taken to get to our goal.\nI say \u2018we\u2019 a lot in this, mainly because we are still best friends and do just about everything together \u2013 even now. (Sad isn\u2019t it? :p) I think the band Beautiful South did a song that sums us up \u2018We are Each Other\u2019.\n\n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/Facebook/Profile%20Pictures/13407041_10209522908131139_285235708089558338_n_zpstyu9xe9i.jpg\n\nThis picture I have chosen because it was taken at almost the start of our journey into this relationship. Taken back in 1981 on the French / Italian border, we were in our teens and had been seeing each other less than six months.\nIt was an exciting time for me, I\u2019d just left school and started seeing this unruly, wild young man with a reputation amongst my peers at school. I was warned more than once to be careful as I was probably getting in way over my head.\nI often joked that the main reason I agreed to go out with him was because I knew it would piss-off my parents \u2013 that\u2019s not true, my parents didn\u2019t really care what I did. \n\n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/iPhone/IMG_1051_zpsh9x4s9as.jpg\n\nThis one is Cassie (Cassiopeia) my puppy. She\u2019s now two years old. She\u2019s a Rottie (75%) and St Bernard cross.\nShe\u2019s certainly a character and loves people but is a little too big and bouncy to meet our granddaughter without supervision \u2013 she\u2019d knock her down just to fuss her.\n\nhttp://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q729/Michelle_Gent/iPhone/IMG_1079_zpstztl1jp9.jpg\n\nApple blossom on a \u2018rescued\u2019 tree. Our daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was moving out of the house he\u2019d lived in for a number of years and the landlord decided to take the opportunity to do a make-over of the garden before the next tenants came in. His dad didn\u2019t \u2018make-over\u2019, he completely ravaged the garden and plants were being uprooted and burned. I asked if I could take a few plants and trees and this is one that avoided the massacre.\nI got two pitiful and worm-eaten apples from it this year, but hopefully, next year it will come into its own.\n\n#curie #minnowsunite",

      "body": "## What happens when Cara's comatose fiancee begins to communicate via social media? ##\n\n**The constant whir and beep of machines had turned into a kind of lullaby and Cara was giving in to it.** \n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/772d799ea1.jpg)\n\nHer head dropped to her chest and as her arm relaxed, the top-of-the-line tablet, with all the bells and whistles her fianc\u00e9e prized so highly, slid dangerously close to the edge of her lap and a two-foot drop onto a solid tile floor.\n\n*Ping!*\n\nCara stirred and caught the tablet. She looked toward the hospital bed where her fianc\u00e9e, Lance had been laying in a coma for thirty-four days now. Nothing had changed. She looked around the room for the source of the noise.\n\n*Ping!*\n\nThe tablet. She thumbed across the screen to bring it back to life, someone had messaged her on Facebook.\n\n> Patricia Leeson- I think it\u2019s great that you are keeping up with\n> Lance\u2019s account, while he\u2019s under. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s here,\n> laughing at our jokes!\n\nCara\u2019s brow wrinkled, she hadn\u2019t added anything to Lance\u2019s account except a post to let everyone know what was going on. She\u2019d been replying to comments there and leaving a new update every day in the comments. Maybe that was it.\n\n*Cara Miller- Sure, I felt like you guys deserved to know what was going on.*\n\nCara had met Patricia numerous times, she was a receptionist at the D As office where Lance worked as a prosecuting attorney. It was comforting to know they were thinking about him.\n\n> Patricia Leeson- Yes, and reading our posts and adding his reactions\n> is really a nice touch. Had me in tears today.\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/7730b505df.jpg)\n\nWhat? That was impossible. Cara clicked into his account, she hadn\u2019t done anything like that. She found account activity and thumbed down through the list. Wow. Someone must have Lance\u2019s password besides her, he\u2019d reacted to over 100 posts in the last 30 days. Weird. Then she noticed a little icon at the bottom of the screen, \u201cMassplanner\u201d, she clicked it. This would explain it, Lance had set up social media automation, pshew, no one had hacked into her comatose fiance\u2019s social media.\n\n*Cara Miller- Not me, must be automated.*\n\n> Patricia Leeson- Well, if so, that\u2019s an automation system I need. Made me laugh so hard!\n\nCara was awake now, so she logged into her own account and read a few posts. She replied to her mom and shared an article from a friend filled with miracle coma stories of people who completely recovered. She looked at Lance, her vision clouded with tears.\n\nI just miss him so  much\u2026she typed, then hit send. The tablet buzzed lightly. She looked down. Someone had already loved her post, she clicked the icon and Lance\u2019s profile pic came up. The room swam just a little, Cara\u2019s ears were filled with the sound of her own pulse and she could feel her throat close in. What was happening?\n\nSomeone does have his password! She thought. How else is that happening? There\u2019s no way that was automated. Cara picked up her phone and called Rick, Lance\u2019s best friend. If anyone knew what was going on it would be him.\n\nWhen Rick arrived, Cara was up, pacing the room. She\u2019d added four new status updates since calling him and Lance\u2019s profile had responded to each of them, it was really starting to freak her out.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just laying there!\u201d she sobbed, when Rick walked in, \u201cAnd some asshole is out there, pretending to be him! This is sick, Rick, this is really messed up!\u201d\n\nRick gently hugged Cara, the two of them had been friends since childhood and had dated briefly in ninth grade, until they decided two kids both with braces should never kiss, to prevent locking, and he\u2019d introduced her to Lance.\n\n\u201cOkay, where\u2019s the Ipad?\u201d he asked.\n\nCara indicated the adjustable rolling table, where she had placed it after finally turning it off. Rick turned the tablet on and it whirred repeatedly.\n\n\u201cWhoa! Whoever it is must have seen me come in here! Now, they\u2019re reacting to my posts, all of them, for like the past two days. Okay, here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. Let me screen capture all of this, then we\u2019re changing the password. We will get to the bottom of who this is, but first, you\u2019re a mess we got to get this to stop!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you! I was afraid if I did that they couldn\u2019t figure it out,\u201d Cara said.\n\nLance smiled, he worked IT for the cyber crimes division of the state police, \u201cWell, because of who Lance is, I can pull some strings at Facebook and get it tracked back to an IP address. We\u2019ll know pretty shortly. I\u2019ve already got someone working on it.\u201d \n\nRick sat down in a chair, connected a keyboard to the tablet and continued to talk as he worked. \u201cOther than this, how are things going? Doctor\u2019s said he was healing well. Any word on when Sleeping Beauty might wake up?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s infuriating, every time I mention something I think is a sign, they just downplay it and say he\u2019ll wake up when his brain is ready, or he won\u2019t,\u201d Cara sighed.\n\n\u201cOkay, set the password you want, then, let\u2019s do this, why don\u2019t you log into your account and change your status? Just to make sure that solves the problem and I will find whoever is responsible. Hopefully someone we know who\u2019s just going through it with us and made a dumb choice,\u201d Rick said.\n\nCara took the Ipad and tapped in a new password. Then, tapped in her own password. Glad to have Rick here to help out. She hit enter and nothing happened. She held her breath, but after a full minute, no reaction had been registered.\n\nRick stood, keys in hand, ready to head back to work, \u201cWell, hopefully that will take care of it, even if it was the automation, that should stop it.\u201d He hugged Cara and moved to the door, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when we figure it\u2026\u201d *Ping*\n\nCara and Rick both froze, then Cara reached out with a trembling hand and picked up the Ipad. There, blinking in navigation bar was a single notification, she clicked it.\n\n> Lance Arnett has reacted to your status.\n\n\u201cUm, Cara, look\u2026\u201d Rick pointed to Lance in the bed. His position hadn\u2019t changed, except that his right hand was turned into a thumb\u2019s up sign. \u201cHa, what\u2019s going on there, Lance? He\u2019s messing with us, right? Lance?\u201d\n\nCara reached out and touched Lance\u2019s cheek, there was no response, he seemed to still be completely out of it. She looked at the monitor, which she had studied for hours every day since his \u2018accident\u2019 and everything appeared exactly the same as it had. \n\nBut, there it was, a thumbs up, and his response to the status had been a \u2018like\u2019 symbolized by a raised thumb.  As she watched, his thumb folded back down slowly and his hand rested on the bed cover.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Cara felt as if the oxygen had been sucked from the room.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should call the doctor?\u201d Rick suggested.\n\n\u201cNo, no way. They\u2019ll just downplay it, I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s awful. Try it again,\u201d she said, holding the Ipad out to Rick.\n\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d Rick hesitated.\n\n\u201cBecause I am terrified, please?\u201d She shook the Ipad, Rick reluctantly accepted it.\n\nHe set the Ipad down and typed in a message. Lance\u2019s thumb went up, followed by a *ping* from the device. Rick typed again, again, thumbs up. Again, this time, the corners of Lance\u2019s mouth went down and the reaction was a teary eyed emoticon.\n\n\u201cOh, my, God,\u201d Cara smiled, \u201cHe\u2019s in there, he knows what\u2019s going on!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but how does he know what I\u2019m putting on Facebook?\u201d Rick set the tablet down and stepped away from it. \u201cI\u2019m going to go now.\u201d \n\n**And with that, he walked out the door.**\n\nCara looked after him, but didn\u2019t leave. She picked up the tablet and started typing. She posted questions, Are you in pain? Lance smiled and a laughing emoticon appeared in the comment box. Can you wake up? Anger! Have you been hearing me the whole time? Thumbs up\n\nCara went on like this for about an hour, smiling, laughing. When the nurse came in for vital\u2019s check, Cara said nothing. About three hours later there was a knock at the door.\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d Cara said.\n\nRick entered the room, \u201cI, uh, brought someone that might help,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry I left in such a hurry, this whole thing is kind of freaking me out. This is my aunt, Delia. She\u2019s, uh, sensitive to stuff like this\u201d\n\n**A tiny, dark skinned woman stood in the door, looking apprehensive.**\n\n\u201cUm, hello, Delia,\u201d Cara said, taking the woman\u2019s hand. \u201cSensitive? You mean, like a psychic?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not psychic, not sensitive, just old,\u201d Delia said sharply, \u201cThis him?\u201d\n\nShe walked to the bed and touched Lance\u2019s hand, which immediately curled into a thumb\u2019s up.\n\n\u201cHelp with what, Rick?\u201d Cara asked.\n\n\u201cFinding out what really happened to him,\u201d Rick said, \u201cWho did this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d Cara said,  \u201cI don\u2019t think I like where this is going. We\u2019ve been over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe official story just didn\u2019t make sense, Cara, he fell off of a ladder? In the middle of an organized crime investigation, one where he was personally threatened?\u201d Rick said.\n\n\u201cRick, you weren\u2019t there! When I found him, he was in the middle of the garage, on his back, with the back of his head bashed in and no pulse! Why else would the ladder have been there? Why else would the attic be open?\u201d Cara sobbed, \u201cI just think we should be grateful he\u2019s communicating.\u201d\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/774055306f.jpg)\n\n\u201cCara, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you. I think we should talk to the doctors, though and let them know what we saw,\u201d Rick suggested.\n\nCara wiped her eyes, \u201cOkay, could you just give me a minute, to get myself together?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a dark secret, girl. Very dark,\u201d the old woman said, as Rick led her from the room and closed the door behind him.\n\nCara walked to the door and listened briefly, then moved quickly to her bag, on a seat by the window on the far side of the bed. She reached in and came out with a large, empty syringe, \u201cSorry, baby,\u201d she said, unhooking a line from Lance\u2019s saline drip. \u201cI can\u2019t have you sharing what you know.\u201d\n\nCara pulled back the plunger on the syringe and fitted it to the line, \u201cGoodbye, Lance, I really did love you.\u201d She said, pressing the plunger home.\n\nLance suddenly set up, his eyes flew open, \u201cCara!\u201d He yelled, Cara jumped back from the bed, but it was too late, the monitor squealed and Lance appeared to seize as the embolism did its work. Cara took a deep breath, refitted the line to the saline drip and dropped the syringe into the red biohazards box on the wall, before moving to the door.\n\n\u201cHelp! I need help, he was waking up, but then\u2026\u201d Cara allowed a nurse to push past her, an evil grin coming turning up the corner of her mouth. \u201cRick, he came to, for a minute, then\u2026\u201d\n\nRick rushed into the room, while his aunt stopped, faced Cara and pointed.\n\n\u201cShut up, bitch, breathe one word of what you think you know and you\u2019re precious Rick is next,\u201d Cara whispered. She walked to the end of the hall and found a seat in the ICU waiting area, as much as she wanted to flee, it would look far too suspicious. \n\nShe\u2019d worked too long to gain his trust, find out what he knew, subvert his case, then lay this trap. If only he\u2019d stayed dead.\n\n**Twenty minutes later Rick came down the hall slowly, from the look on his face, it was over.** \n\nShe masked her relief with a loud sob, \u201cNO! No, it\u2019s not fair! It\u2019s not fair!\u201d As she stood from her seat, Rick wrapped his arms around her and over his shoulder, she glimpsed Delia, a slight grin on her face. What could that woman be smiling about. She\u2019d won.\n\nThe doctors had warned her repeatedly of the risk of embolism in Lance\u2019s case, that\u2019s where she\u2019d gotten the idea. They\u2019d never suspect a thing, and even if they did, what evidence did they have?\n\n\u201cCan I see him, just for a minute? To say goodbye?\u201d Cara asked, Rick nodded. The doctors and nurses had vacated the room, the monitor was gone and Lance\u2019s body lay still in the bed. She walked into the room, leaned over the bed and whispered into his now deaf ear, \u201cI win.\u201d\n\n*Ping*\n\nCara reflexively looked down at the Ipad in her hand a single notification, it was nothing. But the timing\u2026 she had to look.\n\n> You\u2019ve been tagged in a post.\n\nShe clicked on the notification and pulled up the status. There was a short post and a series of comments.\n\n> Rick Jackson- Did you know your killer? @Cara Wilson\n\n*PING*\n\n> Lance Arnett has reacted to a post you\u2019re tagged in.\n\n*THUMBS UP*\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/7743044e4d.jpg)\n\nOn the bed, Lance\u2019s dead right hand, slowly formed into a thumb\u2019s up.\n\n\nLIKE THIS?

      "body": "## In this episode Jack gets to experience being an Aedapt for the first time! ##\n\n**The Things pulled up and powered down their bikes within seconds.** \n\nThing One ripped a pair of Steampunk goggles off and walked over to the map. \u201cShit. They\u2019re ahead of us! Take a look at this, Two!\u201d\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/720a9ad704.jpg)\n***If you've missed an episode, you can catch up [on my blog](https://steemit.com/@markrmorrisjr). Be sure to follow me for updates. ***\n\n*Thing Two pulled a thin leather, zippered folder from his pocket. He opened it to reveal a control panel that looked like a cross between a computer keyboard and the instrument panel of a jetliner. He set it beside the map and started tapping.* \n\nGreen floating type appeared with arrows indicating the individual green dots. Each row of type ended in a series of numbers and symbols.\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s thirty eight of them so far. That means they only need one more.\u201d He turned the model and reached up, sliding sections of it out of the way. He tapped some more on the keyboard.\n\nPhineas peered at the green type, \u201cFor what purpose?\u201d\n\nThe Things looked at each other, \u201cConsensus.\u201d Thing One said, ominously.\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/721ad88476.jpg)\n\n**\u201cOkay, I\u2019m new here, what are we talking about?\u201d Jack asked.**\n\nPhineas was the first to reply, \u201cWell kid; you ever hear of parallel universe theories and what not? You know, where there may be more than one of you leading their own individual lives just slightly different than yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, sure, in comic books and stuff. Wait, you\u2019re saying not only are there other dimensions, but there are multiples of us?\u201d Jack asked.\n\nPhineas nodded, \u201cNow imagine all of those condensed into the ugliest version of you and the rest all cease to exist.\u201d\n\n*Thing One stepped up. He tapped Jack on the ear as the dimensional filters flicked quickly. It ended in one that sent shivers down Jack\u2019s spine. The world around them was completely decimated. It looked like the set of some dystopian apocalypse movie.* \n\nThe two people he saw, where dozens had been, looked like medical experiments. The sky was eerie gray, almost charcoal. The ground was chalky and white. The sun burned a hole through the blackened sky, fierce, red and too small.\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/721dd916f0.jpg)\n\n**\u201cThey want this to be the only dimension.\u201d Thing One said, quietly.**\n\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Jack tapped his ear, returning his view to their current dimension.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, kid,\u201d Phineas sighed.\n\n\u201cWho are \u2018they\u2019, the Noshers?\u201d Jack asked.\n\n\u201cYou wish,\u201d Thing Two said. He folded up his keyboard and slipped it back into his pocket. \u201cNoshers are like junkies; they'll do anything to get what they need. They\u2019re just the help.\u201d\n\n**\u201cThen who?\u201d Jack demanded.**\n\n\u201cThe Shadoe Librarians,\u201d Thing One almost spat the words. \n\n*He folded the map and put it back in the Rabbit, closing the hatchback.* \n\n\u201cThey intend to consolidate the 39 gates into one. Then they can lock down your dimension and reboot it to what you saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cShadoe Librarians?\u201d Jack chuckled, \u201cThey don\u2019t sound very scary. What are they going to do, charge us late fees?\u201d\n\n*Phineas turned and pulled Jack down to his level and began to speak softly and calmly. The edge in the leprechaun\u2019s voice sent a chill through Jack.* \n\n**\u201cThey have no souls, boy, and no imaginations of their own. They are incapable of invention. So, they want to enslave your race and have you create their nightmare dimension.\u201d**\n\n*Thing One rested a hand on Phineas\u2019 shoulder. The Leprechaun released his chokehold on the Aedapt. Jack sank back against the hood of the Rabbit.* \n\n\u201cPhin\u2019s brother was killed by one of the Noshers -the Shadoes\u2019 soul surrogates. So, you\u2019ll have to excuse him if he doesn\u2019t find the Shadoes amusing.\u201d\n\n**Jack\u2019s head was swimming with furious little questions.** \n'\nThey swarmed like wasps around a disturbed hive, demanding answers. He mentally swatted them back. He knew there was not time if they were going to save the world. Even thinking that sounded corny, but here he was. \n\n\u201cOkay, so, what\u2019s next?\u201d \n\n\u201cWe have to get you inside.\u201d Thing One said, grimly.\n\n\u201cHow does that work?\u201d Jack thought back to the map and shuddered. \n\n**This was beginning to sound like a bad idea.**\n\nThing Two said, \u201cYou blend in.\u201d\n\n*It was a short drive to the building. Jack and Phineas crammed into the back seat of the Rabbit. Thing One took shotgun and Thing Two drove. Thing One manipulated the filters on the windshield.* \n\nA tracking grid came up, guiding them to their destination like a 3d GPS. They drove past the building. Jack recognized it from the map. As they passed, a shiver ran down his spine and his pulse quickened. Whatever was waiting in there, it was not good. \n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/7241c89bb5.jpg)\n\nThing Two pulled into an alley about a block down. He checked his mirror for followers, and then opened his door. All four climbed out.\n\n*Thing One placed an arm around Jack\u2019s shoulder. Jack could not remember the last time anyone had done anything like that.* \n\nUnder other circumstances, he might have shrugged it off, but not today. He was becoming part of something bigger than he was. \n\n\u201cOkay, this next bit is going to be weird for you. However, it\u2019s the only way this works. Your Nosher just swallowed his key last night. We need you to grab him and bring him back before they can retrieve it.\u201d\n\n**Jack saw the concerned look on Thing One\u2019s face.** \n\nWhat they were asking was scary, no doubt, but weird was a strange way of putting it. \u201cWhat are you not telling me?\u201d\n\nThing One paused, \u201cWell, the only way for you to get in there is to become one of them.\u201d\n\n**\u201cOne of what?\u201d Jack asked, but he was pretty sure he knew.** \n\nA picture of the creepy, pasty waste-oid from last night filled his imagination. The chill he had felt passing the building returned, times two. \n\n\u201cNosher\u201d said Thing Two, \u201cAre you really that simple, you can\u2019t connect the dots?\u201d He was eating something that looked a deep fried burrito, wrapped in white paper.\n\n**\u201cOkay,\u201d Jack looked at the three men.** \n\n*They were as different from each other as they could be, except for one thing. All three wore the same grim expression. All three were looking to him for solutions. To say he was feeling inadequate would have been the understatement of the century.* \n\n\u201cHow do I do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Jack, have you ever felt like you had the ability to be invisible?\u201d Thing One asked.\n\n*Jack laughed; it was one of his favorite childhood fantasies, invisibility. He used to hide from his step mom for hours. Over the years, he had worked on his ability to blend into crowds, too.* \n\n**\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d**\n\nThing One slipped on a pair of sunglasses. He turned Jack to face him so that Jack could see his reflection in the mirrored glasses. \n\n\u201cReady?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, sure.\u201d Jack answered, not sure at all.\n\n\u201cI want you to think about the Nosher you met last night, got it?\u201d \nThing One asked. Jack nodded. \u201cNow blink!\u201d\n\n*Jack blinked and his reflection wavered, like static on an old-fashioned broadcast TV. He blinked again and his head felt like it was spinning, and then stopped.* \n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgsafe.org/7246557335.jpg)\n\nHe focused; looking back at him from the mirrored surface of the sunglasses was a Nosher. \n\n**Not the Nosher who had stolen the key. It had Jack\u2019s features!**\n\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d He glanced over his shoulder, certain a Nosher would be standing right behind him. When he looked back he caught his own reflection again, Nosher looks intact. \n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d \n\nHe reached up and pulled the skin around his eyes down a little. \n\n**The Nosher in the reflection did the same.**\n\nNow it was Phineas\u2019 turn to chuckle, \u201cYou\u2019re an Aedapt boy! You\u2019ve been doing this your whole life without knowing it.\u201d\n\n*\u201cSeriously, I think I would remember having turned into a Goth crack head,\u201d Jack snapped.*\n\n***Can Jack retrieve the key in time, or will the Origin Dime face the possibility of total annihilation?***\n\n## Look for the upvote button below.

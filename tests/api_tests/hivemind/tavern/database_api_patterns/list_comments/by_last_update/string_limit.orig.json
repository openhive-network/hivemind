      "body": "I love this article! \n\nYes,  I think most believers of most religions are *trying* to worship the same being.  I love the image of all those different gods represented by light,  which is the most basic form of energy that even uneducated shepherds could understand thousands of years ago. \n\nOne of my favorite quotes: \"If you can fit God into your head,  you have made him too small.\" I think that a guy sitting on a cloud looking down on us,  listening to our prayers,  snapping his fingers and *poof* the universe was created in 6 earth days.... That feels like a god I can fit into my head.  Totally unsatisfying (and I'm a devout Christian). Even the Hebrew word Yahweh means *I am*,  which to me translates as \"I am Everything,\" ie,  the Universe and all it contains.\n\nEven that,  I feel,  is incomplete.  But I marvel that God spent 13 billion years,  with exploding stars (to make heavier elements) and evolution in order to make bodies that his children could use to experience life in this dimension. (Not that God didn't do a million other things,  in addition to us). \n\nAnyway,  I always enjoy your articles!",

      "body": "@sykochica  Glad you liked my post on Transhumanism BTW\nI've got a post I'm working up on on Informationalism which is an integrated information theory meant as sort of right angle theory diverging from QM. \n \nAnyways, once that is out of the way, I'll probably have time for a mind blowing post on Transhumanism.  The heretickitten response was more or less just an \"off the top of my head\" response to counter her saying that I don't really see any place where evolution ever stops.\n\nThe real question is what happens when we actually hop in evolution's driver's seat?\nI think there will be more than meets the eye there ;)\n\nTo answer your specific questions.\nAt every stage along the way will find both luddites as well as people who just choose not to join us beyond that step.  Many will be left behind.\n\nSome will never allow an upgrade.  Most likely there will be problems both real and perceived especially if the upgrade process ends up missing or overshooting the uncanny divide somehow.\n\nThere will also be those who view functional immortality as a sort of damnation.  A deathless state from which they cannot escape.  We're already at the point where we can keep patients alive on machinery though.  So the question becomes, when is it right to pull the plug?  \nDo people have a right to die when they feel they've lived too long?  Who are we to deny them death?  Who are they to deny us their company?  Especially if copies become cheap and easy to maintain.  Furthermore, what is our duty of care, not only to copies of others, but to copies of ourselves?\n\nThere will also be religious objectors.  People already believe that they can pray away any illness, or that all illness is simply god's judgment.  Imagine what they are going to be dealing with when this becomes mainstream.\n\nOne reason I push so hard for unity and for seeing all humans as being equal is to try and prepare us for that day.  It's one of  the reasons behind this posting...\nhttps://steemit.com/steemit/@williambanks/why-more-parents-of-brunettes-are-home-schooling-their-kids\n\nIf I can get enough response on it, I'll probably start a mini movement to encourage people to change their perceptions about other people.  Thinking about calling it #eraseism.\n\nYour other question about reproduction.  I don't see it even slowing down.  One reason for reproduction is to maintain in working order the biological information contained within our DNA.\nBut if our DNA is suddenly modified by machinery and/or we are finding ourselves suddenly fully homo superior and still able to reproduce in the biological sense.  What does that make our offspring?  Are they just robots, automatons?  I don't think so.  Personally i think we will love them and raise them to be the best \"people\" that they can be.\nSee I don't see us ever actually losing the human component, our humanity, just because our information is suddenly on a new substrate.\n\nFinal question was about resources.  Interestingly as our technology has improved our species have also become much more efficient in terms of resource consumption on a per capita per annum basis.\nI don't see that slowing down or changing course at all.  I mean it might.\nHowever there is a very good chance that we will learn to be extremely efficient at timesharing resources.\n\nAn example is the trip to mars example.  Mars has limited resources.  It would make far more sense for a physical body to be constructed on site, one optimized for mars than to send a whole human body there.\n\nYou could be multiply conscious in exactly this way.  Playing tennis on earth and exploring mars at the same time.  Different bodies but a single mind just doing different things.  It's a matter of how aware each system is of the other.  How entangled we can make our conscious minds.\n\nHowever after the vacation to mars, it would be idiotic to grey goo the martian body when done.  Better to just use the same scaffolding and reconfigure it to the needs of the next occupant on the fly.  We'll rent bodies like we do hotel rooms now, complete with all the right plumbing and carpet that matches the curtains :)\n\nTo my mind this means that by the time we reach this stage we'll value energy and time much different than we do now.  The body you played tennis with during the day, might be used by someone else at night to go on a bender down town.  The information that is you, may already be off in a whole new country enjoying local cuisine.  Or you may choose to sleep in your body.  Do we dream of electric sheep?\n\nI don't see any sort of plateau to the number of consciousness's that exist, just the computational and energy limits inherent in the universe.  \n\nBut that doesn't mean we'll ever be \"bored\".  There will be all kinds of challenges to overcome.\nImagine trying to explain what commuting to work is like to someone from 100 years ago.  Imagine explaining to your younger self what a pain in the ass life becomes when you need to charge your cellphone.  Or how stressful life can be when your data plan gets throttled to a speed rate that would still be WAY higher than anything that a 1990s kid on dialup could conceive of. \n \nIt's happening every single day.  We just don't see it, because we're used to it.\nIf I ever build a time machine I'm going to go to 2006 and talk to my adult self about smartphones.  I think we'll have a laugh together.",

But it also means we see patterns even when they are not there.\nWe also miss important things because we get too wrapped up in the patterns we do see and don't always dig deeper.\n\nhttp://brainden.com/images/old-couple.jpg\nHow many scenes are in the image above?\n\nAnyways I applaud the kid, but the one thing he seemed too focused on was looking for patterns.  But the strange thing is that the patterns we see may not be where the information is.\nUsually most information is found \"when the pattern breaks\".\n\nThe most exciting word in science is rarely ever \"Eureka!\", but \n\"Wow that's weird...\"\n\nNevertheless, I watched the video and literally gave the kid a standing ovation.  \nThe fact is, even if his beliefs are completely wrong, and even if his \"free energy\" device is nothing in hindsight.  The fact is he is willing to do the hardwork of learning.  They literally don't teach people to think anymore.  Merely to memorize facts and figures that are handed to them, and they aren't allowed to question why.\nHe's asking the hardest question of all.

      "body": "<center>http://i64.tinypic.com/vwtyli.jpg</center>\n# These kinds of stories can only be written by real life.\n\n**Hope you'll enjoy reading!**\n\nToday I met a friend of mine who owns a carpentry's workshop. He told me the following story:\n\nNine years ago, he hired a trainee. For two and a half years, this trainee was a prime example. He was punctual, reliable, honest, and rarely sick. But after passing his written exams, things changed very quickly. It started with him coming to work late - if not calling in sick. He no longer complied with agreements and showed little interest in his work. Things reached the negative maximum when he lost a client's keychain; car, house, and office keys included. The loss for this small carpentry amounted to 5,000 \u20ac (about 5,600 USD).\n\nAfter this, my friend sat down with his trainee to discuss the future. Since the trainee had only two more weeks to go to finish his training and do the oral exams, they agreed upon a compensatory time-off. The extra hours made were generally not paid, but compensated with time off (*very common in the German construction industry*).\n\nTwo weeks later, the trainee passed his oral exams. The trainee never showed up in that carpentry again.\n\nBut they shouldn't have met for the last time. Approximately three weeks after the training was finished, the carpenter received a letter sent from the trainee's lawyer. It said the trainee claimed the salary for the last two weeks of the training. The master carpenter was furious, he felt betrayed, and he was angry and disappointed at the same time. He didn't want to pay this, so both parties met in court. The judge decided in favor of the trainee. The rationale for this decision was that there had not been a written agreement. (*The trainee had claimed having been exempted from work and local laws stipulate that the salary has to be paid in such cases.*)\n\nThis means, the master carpenter had to pay the trainee's salary, the costs for the law suit and even for the trainee's lawyer. He did so, reluctantly, and they have never met again since then.\n\nThe following years, that trainee worked for a different company, in an executive position, supervising about 10 to 15 people. He applied for a position in another company. There, he would have supervised double the number of employees than before and would have earned a lot more than in his former position. Actually, everything had been discussed already, the former trainee only waited for the final approval.\n\nThat's when the master carpenter got a phone call. The person calling was the head of a metal processing company. Said firm was only a few hundred meters away from the carpentry and the two guys knew each other quite well. Being asked for the reason of the call, the head of the metal processing company said it was about the master carpenter's former trainee who had applied for a job. He wanted to know how the trainee had done during his time at the carpentry.\n\nWhat do you think was his response?\n\nWell, the former trainee didn't get that job, if you know what I mean.\n\nSo is this Karma? I think it is. **What goes around comes around!**\n\nWhats ur opinion, I would like to hear your thoughts in the coments below.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWhat is our Blog about: [Introduceyourself Post](https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@paa/say-hello-to-the-guys-behind-our-blog-people-are-awesome-member-of-official-steam-wiki-faqs-and-leader-of-germany-wiki)\n\nThanks to @ines-f for the Translation.

What could this be? Especially what could it be when we finished tinkering. \n<center>http://i68.tinypic.com/2hzltoj.jpg</center>\nJust guess and write it in the comments below... \n\nThis arrived us yesterday.

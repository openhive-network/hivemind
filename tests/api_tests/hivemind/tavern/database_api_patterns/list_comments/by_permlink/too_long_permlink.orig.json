      "body": "Hello, World!\n\nMy intention is not to make it into top 19. I could name many  other candidates (clearly more than 19) with greater commitment to steem(it) who are a lot more appropriate as witnesses, but I'm sure I can be useful as a backup witness.\n\nI introduced myself here:\nhttps://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@gtg/hello-world\nThose of you who use https://steemit.chat know me as **Gandalf**.\nFor some time, I\u2019ve been using my magic powers (mostly those related to security and infrastructure) to improve steemit. For example, I\u2019ve improved our \"Perfect\" Forward Secrecy and made our communication with site more secure.\n\nMy **seed node** (EU based):\n`seed-node = gtg.steem.house:2001`\nYou can also use it to rsync data dir\n`rsync -Pa rsync://gtg.steem.house/witness_node_data_dir .`\n\nMy **witness node** is on a separate data center (an EU-based one as well).\nIf you believe I can be of value to steemit, please vote for me:\n`vote_for_witness YOURACCOUNT gtg true true`\n\n![witness](https://grey.house/img/witness.jpg)",

They are cheaper.</p>\n<p>2. They are available immediately, no need to order, wait, or move physically to get them.</p>\n<p>3. They never get lost.</p>\n<p>4. They don\u2019t take any space, or weight, this brings many added benefits to the world:</p>\n<p>4.1. You can have a library of thousands of books with you wherever you are, on different devices (since they can be stored in the cloud)</p>\n<p>4.2. You will free a lot of shelve space at home/office, which also means less dust being created at home.</p>\n<p>4.3. If all students were forced to use eBooks they wouldn\u2019t have to carry such heavy backpacks which can deform their spines.</p>\n<p>4.4. If all students used eBooks exclusively, there would be CO2 emission reductions since that\u2019s a lot of weight that doesn\u2019t have to be transported by cars/buses/trains.</p>\n<p>5. You can read them on different devices: e-readers, computers, smartphones.</p>\n<p>6. You can copy and paste.</p>\n<p>7. If you lend them you never have to beg your friend to give the book back, it comes back to you automatically.</p>\n<p>8. You can search inside them.</p>\n<p>9. If you don\u2019t know the meaning of a word, a dictionary is always there for you, just touch/click the word in question.</p>\n<p>10. The same book may come in different languages.</p>\n<p>11. You can change font types, font sizes, color of the screen, margins, line spacing.</p>\n<p>12. You can have lots of bookmarks, you can navigate your bookmarks.</p>\n<p>13. You can read them with the light turned off.</p>\n<p>14. You can read them with one hand, turning pages is effortlessly. Awesome when you go out for a walk and you have only one hand available.</p>\n<p>15. No more wrinkled, stained, or broken pages.</p>\n<p>16. You can share your highlights on social networks.</p>\n<p>17. You can open a web browser right from the book if there\u2019s a web reference.</p>\n<p>18. There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cout of print\u201d</p>\n<p>19. It learns your reading speed and tells you how much time left you have on the current chapter or the whole book.</p>\n<p><br>\n\u2026need more reasons?<br>\nor you will keep reading books because you like the smell of paper, even though there\u2019s really a lot of stinky books out there.are you still using cassette tapes, vinyl discs, hell are you still using CDs?</p>\n</html>",

Looking at \u201cinterfaces\u201d and using them like a recipe without really knowing their true power, I look at the past and I was so limited, hopefully I\u2019ll look at this post 15 years from now and think the same.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s lots of books out there on best programming practices you should follow, on this short post I\u2019ll share with you 5 principles that I follow that I promise you will make your code behave really well, less bug prone, simple and elegant when it comes to Object Oriented design. This advice will probably apply better if you code in a language like Java or C#, I\u2019m not sure if you can say these principles will apply 100% to other OO languages (for instance those that allow multiple inheritance)</p>\n<p><strong>1. DRY principle.</strong><br>\nThis is one of the most preached ones, and I will also preach it. DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF. Really, don\u2019t. It ALWAYS comes to bite you in the ass if you have repeated code. Only repeat yourself if it\u2019s too hard to not do so or if you\u2019re absolutely sure that you won\u2019t repeat yourself a third time, but I promise you that third time will come if it\u2019s not for you for the next guy maintaining that code.</p>\n<p>The obvious benefit of not repeating yourself is that you get to maintain code only in one place, the added benefit will be that your code will almost start being written by itself like a perfect equation as it grows. DRY code will be reusable, maintainable and the other principles I\u2019ll talk about are related to the DRY principle in one way or another.<br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>2. Keep the scope at the minimum, be as private as possible.</strong></p>\n<p>Keep your variables as close to your local scope as possible. This will save you many headaches, will protect you from bugs in logic because you did something to a variable in place where it shouldn\u2019t have been in the first place, and it will keep things simpler.</p>\n<p>This also tells you that your classes should expose as little as possible. Keep your variables local, if they can\u2019t be local, try to keep them as private members, if they have to be used by extending classes keep them private, only use public when you really know it\u2019s ok to make something public and that nobody is going to break the behavior of your object if they play with things at any point in time.</p>\n<p>Keeping scope at a minimum can also prevent issues on longer lived objects like singletons that might be accessed by different objects. If you abuse the use of object properties you could have one object changing the internal state of the object while another tries to do something and you\u2019ll get unexpected behavior, this tends to happen a lot in multithreaded environments where programmers are not careful and forget objects might be accessed by different threads/clients at the same time, tight scopes will protect you.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Be functional</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes you\u2019ll be tempted to be lazy and not pass parameters on a method and think that you\u2019re so clever by changing an internal property of an object so that another function in the object will then get it. Big mistake buddy. This can be equivalent to that advice from functional programming languages where you\u2019re told that using global variables are a bad idea.<br>\nYes, we have object properties for several reasons, but if the logic of a method depends on the state of a variable, you might as well be explicit and pass it in the method.</p>\n<p>This is in a way related to keeping scope at the minimum, and to some extend related to the advice some give of keeping your objects as immutable as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Only abstract classes are worth extending.</strong><br>\nIf you have control over the class you are about to extend (if it\u2019s in your codebase) before you extend that class take a look and make sure that it\u2019s an abstract class. Abstract classes are MEANT to be extended, so you can be safe that you\u2019re doing the right thing here.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re extending a non abstract class, you should probably be composing it instead. If you don\u2019t have access to the code of the class you are extending, things could not behave as expected when you extend, not all programmers are as thoughtful as you are.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Keep Object lifetime as short as possible.</strong><br>\nThis goes back to keeping scopes tight and trying to avoid singletons as much as possible (as convenient as they might be), in the case of java the JRE has a better time collecting garbage and will save you from memory leak headaches. Put those factories to work.</p>\n<p>Feel free to disent and share your favorite principles, If you\u2019ve coded long enough I\u2019m sure you tend to think about these things too and I\u2019d love to learn from your experiences.</p>\n</html>",

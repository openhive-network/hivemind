Steemit, by providing a free and decentralized forum, will I think do more good than harm, maybe even a great deal of good.\n\nIndividuals do routinely pay to publish  and advertise, which does effectively promote ideas and products.  As far as I'm concerned that is as it should be.  \n\nI'm with Hayek in disliking the term 'society'. \n\nYou can dislike the Steemit system as much as you please.  I only wonder why you bother to participate if you find it so undesirable.  Why not start a service selling space for publications an ads?",

      "body": "Thanks. \nYou raise a valid point. Indeed, the Steemit system of voting and rewards does not constrain the consumers' expression of their preferences as much as a true market economy in which currency (or real money, but that's so rare these days) is the medium of exchange. This of course means that signals conveyed by voting on Steemit will have more noise than the signals conveyed in a free market economy. \nStill, the value of a vote depends on how much Steem Power the voter holds, and frequent posting or voting temporarily reduces the potency of ones votes. In any case I think its interesting that Steemit at least rewards the posting of content valued by other participants, more so than for example Facebook, where the only rewards are comments, likes and shares (popularity).",

      "body": "But if content is paid to consume then the price immediately drops to 0.\n\nIf there is a singer that sells his music for free, and one that sells it for 1$, given that there is competition and they will be similar in quality, everyone will prefer the free stuff.\n\nNobody is willing to pay for something trivial, even if the producer has put tons of work in it. The value is set by the market not by the content creator.\n\nThis is why all content creators use 3rd party monetization tools, otherwise they would all go broke. Nobody is willing to pay 10$ for a youtube video, but if they see a nice T-shirt there they might buy it for 10$, and the producer gets a comission from that.\n\nSo it's not a problem about valuation, but the fear that the market would value abundant content like videos to 0$.",

      "body": "I should have reread and rephrased my reply before positing. I do not have a formal background in economics, so please forgive me if I use incorrect terminology or if I ever appear to be stand on a crumbling foundation, but I will try my best to understand and be understood. I do not believe there is *one solution* for this problem or any other that emerges from the convoluted actions of human behavior. \n\nI absolutely agree that people ought to be sending proper market signals to service providers (no matter how benevolent or ruthless the SPs are), just in case they happen to give a shit what their customers (or slaves) think.  Luckily it's unlikely Netflix or Steemit will ever train a gun to my chest and demand anything, so I at least have the opportunity to peacefully opt out of their services without fear. I'm not given the option of opting out when it comes to governance; the current occupying forces deny it.\n\nI choose little to no participation in involuntary protection rackets, because of the lack of this choice.  I agree that many of societies woes are rooted in the fact that often people do not properly relay important economic information to those they receive (voluntary or involuntary) services from.\n\nConsidering just how complex and dangerous the plantation is, I make my decisions concerning it on a case by case basis.  And concerning the morality of the matter, when confronted with enslavement, I will choose to opt out as often as I can stand to bear the violence of their reactions.\n\nAgain, you're absolutely right that service providers need to be made aware of how their patrons view and value their services by the very dollars they spend, but if I can refuse payment and participation from a violent monopoly altogether, I will do so, and I will find another way to send them just as bold an assessment of value.\n\nThanks for the fun and thought-provoking commentary, @xerographica!",

      "body": "<html>\n<p>http://unitedcivilrights.org/images/fa-prprty.gif</p>\n<p>The purpose of property rights is to mitigate conflict over scarce, rivalrous resources. To have a property right over a scarce, rivalrous resource is to have the right to exclude others from using that resource in the attainment of some ends. For example, I have property rights over my body, which means I can exclude others from using my body for sexual pleasure or labor without my consent. If they do access my body in such a way without my consent, it's called rape or slavery, respectively. Likewise, I have property rights over the accumulated capital for which I consensually trade my time and labor, which means I have the right to exclude people from using my accumulated capital without my consent. When someone accesses my accumulated capital in such a way without my consent, it's called theft or trespass.<br>\nScale doesn't change this. If I transform my accumulated capital into a factory by hiring people who voluntarily exchange the product of their labor for some of my accumulated capital, this means that they value what they receive in exchange for working more than they value the direct product of their labor (the factory). Likewise, it means I value the factory more than the accumulated capital I gave up for it. This is a win-win situation, or a positive sum game. The workers I hired retain property rights over the capital they received as payment for their labor, which means they can exclude others from the use of their newly acquired accumulated capital, and I retain property rights over the factory, which means I can exclude others from the use of my factory.<br>\nDiscrepancies between marginal benefit don't change this either. A consensual exchange doesn't become theft just because one party benefits more from the exchange than another. If this wasn't the case, every single instance of buyer's remorse would be indicative of theft. If someone agrees to produce a walking stick in exchange for ten dollars and the purchaser of the walking stick then sells it to someone else for twenty dollars, how can it be claimed that the producer of the walking stick was a victim of theft if they haven't been deprived of the ten dollars for which they voluntarily exchanged the walking stick? Would it have been reasonable to expect that the first purchaser of the walking stick wouldn't have obtained more than ten dollars of value from it given that the exchange wouldn't have happened in the first place if they hadn't valued the walking stick more than they valued ten dollars?<br>\nOf course not. Anything that happens to the walking stick after the original exchange is no business of the producer of the walking stick because said producer already exchanged his property rights to the walking stick for property rights to a different form of accumulated capital (ten dollars).<br>\nLikewise, if I use more of my accumulated capital to hire workers to work in my factory, they will only accept my offer of employment if they value what I'm offering more than their own free time and more than whatever stake they may have otherwise had in the product they will be producing. In other words, if they accept employment, it will be with the understanding that they're giving up any stake in what they're producing in exchange for what I'm offering them. Maybe my factory assembles televisions. Maybe one worker can produce one television per hour. Would they be able to produce televisions this efficiently without my previous investment in production capital (which hasn't even been recouped and probably never will be completely given that maintenance, employment and higher order production good costs are a revolving door)? Would they be able to produce televisions AT ALL without this previous investment in production capital? Of course not, and they know this, which is why they're willing to give up both their leisure and whatever stake their labor may have otherwise entitled them to in the production of a television in exchange for a fixed amount of accumulated capital.<br>\nAs was the case with the walking stick, whatever happens to the television after this exchange occurs is no business of the worker. How could the future sale of the television constitute theft of the worker's accumulated capital if it can't be demonstrated that the worker was deprived of the accumulated capital that he voluntarily accepted as payment for the production of the television, especially given that the television was produced with other accumulated capital (plastic, circuits, labor saving devices, etc.) that the worker never even owned?<br>\nIt can't.<br>\nProperty ownership necessarily implies exclusivity, which means that \"private property\" is redundant, as is \"personal property\". The words \"private\" and \"personal\" denote exclusivity, which is already implied by the word \"property\". To differentiate between \"personal property\" and \"private property\" is therefore a distinction without a difference. This implication of exclusivity also means that \"public property\" is a contradiction in terms. If no one can be excluded from using the resource, it isn't property. Resources that aren't scarce or rivalrous likewise can not be considered property, which means that \"intellectual property\" is also a contradiction in terms.<br>\nThis means that seizing the means of production is a genuine form of theft and that \"pirating\" music, software, art and writing is not, which may seem counter-intuitive if you attended the indoctrination camps euphemistically known as \"public schools\" when you were growing up.</p>\n</html>",

We're not reversing that,\" Obama said, describing the necessity of international supply chains and the importance of the export sector to U.S. jobs and the economy. \"The notion that we're going to pull that up root and branch is unrealistic.\"\n\nThe notification, a new requirement of the trade promotion authority legislation Congress passed last year to expedite passage of the Asia-Pacific pact, is \u201cmeant to ensure early consultations between the administration and Congress,\u201d Matt McAlvanah, a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, said in a statement. \u201cAs such, the draft SAA [Statement of Administrative Action] was sent today in order to continue to promote transparency and collaboration in the TPP process.\u201d\n\nThe White House's draft document describes the major steps the administration will take to implement any changes to U.S. law required by the deal. Those actions range from the mundane \u2014 designating an administration point of contact for communications about the pact \u2014 to the complex \u2014 setting up procedures to stop harmful surges of agricultural or textile imports.\n\nBut the deal is going nowhere until the White House addresses a number of concerns lawmakers have raised about the trade agreement, which Canada, Mexico, Japan and eight other countries joined the United States in signing last February.\n\nFirst and foremost: satisfying the concerns of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and other lawmakers about protections for a new class of drugs known as biologics. They say the pact provides too short a monopoly period for rights to research and development data. Other lawmakers have complained the deal would bar tobacco companies from seeking redress through investor-state dispute arbitrage for damages resulting from country regulations. Still others are seeking assurances that member countries will abide by their commitments to provide access for U.S. pork and dairy exports.\n\nUntil these issues are resolved, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have made clear that the pact will not get the votes it needs to pass.\n\nRyan's spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, reiterated the point on Friday.\n\n\u201cAs Speaker Ryan has stated for months, there are problems that remain with the administration\u2019s TPP deal, and there can be no movement before these concerns are addressed,\" she said.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have largely called the deal a nonstarter over concerns about the enforceability of labor and environmental standards in countries like Vietnam and the lack of strong protections against currency manipulation.\n\nThe administration claims it is making progress on these issues and has resolved others, including banking industry concerns over the exclusion of financial data from rules prohibiting countries from requiring local storage.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t change the reality of the down-ballot drag that candidates are facing as they campaign back home in their districts. In a reversal from years past, many Republicans are on the defensive about their support for free trade because of Donald Trump\u2019s daily tirades about what he characterizes as the serious economic damage wrought by trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the TPP as well as his complaints that China is flouting international trade rules.\n\nThe Republican platform picked up on this theme, saying significant trade deals \"should not be rushed or undertaken in a Lame Duck Congress.\"\n\nThe small band of Democrats who the administration hopes will support the TPP are facing increased pressure within their own party to abandon the president on the agreement. Sens. Bernie Sanders\u2019 and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s strong condemnations of the trade deal have forced Hillary Clinton, who supported the TPP as Obama\u2019s secretary of state, to reject the pact to appease the liberal wing.\n\n\"I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\" Clinton said during an economic policy speech at an automotive manufacturing plant in Warren, Mich., on Thursday. \"I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election and I'll oppose it as president.\"\n\nClinton\u2019s clear rejection of the trade deal has emboldened liberal groups like the Warren-aligned Progressive Change Campaign Committee to launch a campaign to press Democrats to publicly oppose a TPP vote in the lame duck.\n\nSanders also called on Democratic congressional leaders to go on record against the White House\u2019s effort to get the deal done by the end of the year, saying the agreement is opposed by every trade union and the grassroots base of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"I am disappointed by the president's decision to continue pushing forward on the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that will cost American jobs, harm the environment, increase the cost of prescription drugs and threaten our ability to protect public health,\u201d the Vermont senator said in a statement after learning of the White House's action on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration continues to press the deal in key congressional districts \u2014 especially those of Democrats who supported the trade promotion authority bill last year.\n\nInterior Secretary Sally Jewell returned to her hometown of Seattle last month to tout the TPP\u2019s potential effects on the environment at a Washington Council on International Trade event with more than 150 business leaders.\n\nThen, last week, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker hit the San Diego and Boulder districts of Reps. Susan Davis and Jared Polis \u2014 two of the 28 House Democrats that voted for the bill \u2014 and visited a steel plant in Cleveland to promote the TPP. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew did the same when he met with local and state officials and Fortune 500 business executives in Minneapolis.\n\nOn Thursday, Undersecretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere Kathryn Sullivan spoke at a Seattle clean energy business roundtable focused on the TPP and the environment. And this Monday, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Robert Holleyman will participate in a World Affairs Council of Atlanta discussion on the trade deal featuring former Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss and UPS CEO David Abney.\n\nAs the political fight plays out, the nuts-and-bolts process of moving the deal forward will continue. Once Congress reviews the draft notification that the White House submitted on Friday, the administration can move forward with sending lawmakers a final statement and the draft of the implementing bill itself. The legislation will describe the actual changes to U.S. law to comply with the rules of the trade agreement.\n\nAfter that, the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees could hold \u201cmock markups\u201d of the bill (because under trade promotion authority, Congress is not actually allowed to tinker with the agreement or its implementing legislation itself, but it can ask the administration to do so).\n\nBut given the tenor of the elections, the entire process could be pushed into a crowded lame-duck legislation session, which would mean no time for the mock markups. Instead, there could be a lot of deal-making between the White House and congressional leadership to move the bill before Clinton or Trump takes over on Jan. 20.\n\nObama said last week that he\u2019s ready to press his case. \"Right now, I'm president, and I'm for it. And I think I've got the better argument,\" he said.\n\nSource:\nwww.politico.com/story/2016/08/obama-congress-trade-warning-226952",

OH GOD!! DID AN AIRPLANE HIT ONE OF THE NUCLEAR PLANTS??!!\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard it all and it was nothing more than a buzzing, though an irritating one nonetheless. Her instincts, those things cops called their gut instincts told her Mister Blue-eyes was the key, the only thing really important right now. Mister Blue-eyes and whatever the hell it was he was watching outside their little tin prison. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u201cNOW LISTEN DAMMIT!!!\u201d She hollered, trying to make herself louder than the loudest of them, a difficult task with New Yorkers. \u201cI told you, there\u2019s no goddamn reason to think it\u2019s terrorism! This has happened before in our lifetimes and it\u2019s gonna happen again. As far as I\u2019m concerned it ain\u2019t nothing more than a power outage. Going FUCKING crazy ain\u2019t gonna help us any, dammit!!\u201d &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kept going, some of them, but most paid her mind and listened, their faces drawn and tired. They\u2019d suffered enough the last few years, New Yorkers. There wasn\u2019t a one of them, including herself, who hadn\u2019t had their world turned literally upside down two years before. The terror they\u2019d lived was fresh on their minds, fresh and ready to burst again and overwhelm them. It was a hard thing, it truly, truly was. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u201cNow I just got off the phone with my partner and he says he\u2019s gonna get people down here to get us out as soon as possible. There are trains stalled all over the city. Rescue workers are leading those people out from underground and up to their homes. He told me there would be a group of them here soon. He was gonna get them here.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u201cIs that them?\u201d Came the deep voice of Jeffrey Thornton. He\u2019d been quiet while the others yelled, silent and listening to what she had to say. The moment she\u2019d spoken of rescue his eyes had gone outside the train and he saw what Mister Blue-eyes had apparently been watching. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u201cWhere?\u201d She asked him, stumbling over and peering outside, right next to the stranger in the baseball cap. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw nothing at first, her eyes trying to focus past the reflections in the glass and out into the pitch black. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u201cThose--,\u201d Mister Blue-eyes said, at last speaking, his voice accented in a manner she\u2019d never heard before. Something about it was as wrong and as otherworldly as his eyes were. \u201c---are not rescuers of any sort.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the corner of her eye she saw him rise and back away from the window and once again her instincts spoke to her. They told her to back away as well, and to not stop there. They said to her, no, they screamed at her to run, to run as far from here as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she didn\u2019t, she had to see what they were, had to see for herself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the figures finally did materialize from the darkness, they weren\u2019t human at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End Part 29</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find yourself interested in the whole damnedable thing and wanna throw me a few bucks, here's a link to it on Amazon.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Blood-Felipe-Mena/dp/1467990639/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1470836827&amp;sr=8-1\">https://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Blood-Felipe-Mena/dp/1467990639/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1470836827&amp;sr=8-1</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

      "body": "http://i.giphy.com/3oAt28uFXyrrgR1pte.gif\n\n# I have to hide my true self.\n\nIt just so happened that I was constantly losing my friends. It's like a curse was put on me.\nJudging by the reviews from former colleagues and friends, I was a \"nice and friendly person who was always willing to help.\"\n\n# However, constantly all these friends ceased to be friends with me, for no reason. They just stopped communicating, no quarrels, no disagreements and other things!\n\nI had a lot of friends ... But our paths diverged.\n\nIn my childhood I had friends, but my family moved to another city, and I lost my friends. In the new city, I made new friends. I had one close friend. Even his move to another part of the city has not prevented us from seeing each other every weekend. And one day, he was taken into the army. And one day, his aunt came to me, and said that he is no more, he was killed when he was on sentry duty ...\n\n![imaged6bd4.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/07/26/imaged6bd4.jpg)\n\nPeople ignore me constantly on the Internet, too. On any website, forum. I try to communicate, start a dialogue, and all people just ignore me. Suffice it to ask someone about something, write, and so on, and no response. \n\n# It's as if I did not exist.\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/3o72FhMTVaOTycqObu.gif\n\nI am always open and friendly, and in return I receive arrogance against me or they completely ignore me.\nThis is what hurts the self-assessment.\n\n# I have no one to talk, no one to share the news with. Not one to ask for help. When I die, nobody will notice. \n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/l46CABOxa2Itf99bG.gif\n\n# I change people!\n\nI've got one property ... when a person begins to communicate with me, he is beginning to change. He begins to listen to the music that I like. He begins to lead a similar lifestyle. In general, people change for the better. From this, I feel somehow enhanced. And apparently, it has become another man moves away from me and goes his own way. As the chicks leave the nest as adults. Other explanation I can find.\n\n# Childhood\n\nAt school I was a \"whipping boy\".\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/Hem0mSEEPwQBa.gif\n\nEndured constant insults, humiliation. Every day for 3 years. The school was torture for me. I did not like school, sometimes skipped lessons to avoid it all. Of course, it has affected my level of education, I studied badly.\n\nAnd also, my eyesight began to deteriorate, I did not see what was written on the blackboard. And when I  admitted that I had bad eyesight, meant even more exposure to ridicule. In addition, due to health problems, but rather due to an error from talentless doctors, I had to take some strange drug. What it was I do not know, but I remember that I had to take these pills with milk. At first, nothing happened ... but then I wanted to eat every 5 minutes, I could not stop! I suffered from hunger! And accordingly, I gained weight. Needless to say, that became more humiliation for me.\n\nPerhaps it is karma. After all, before all this, I, too, along with all, mocked other classmates. Well now I know, I deserve it all.\n\nIt all ended when I graduated from high school. I changed just for the summer. Completely changed! I was starving and had grown very thin. Enrolling in college, I stopped being afraid of the people because they did not know who I was at school. Former classmates simply did not recognize me in the street. I became a different person. I started a new life with a clean slate.\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/763KvbtkqH3e8.gif\n\n# I'm for searching myself.\n\n### Punk.\n\nOne day on one local forum, I found an ad that a punk rock band was looking for a drummer. I do not know why, or what came over me, or how my subconscious played a role, but I wrote to them that I am ready to join them.\n\nIn those years, I liked punk rock. But I did not know how to play the drums! However, I had an ear for music and rhythm. Since childhood, I remember I loved playing improvised drums.\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/3oEjI2cJuP3Y0dcfV6.gif\n\nAt the first rehearsal something happened. But, of course, I played really disgusting. I liked that I was with other people. I liked all the socializing after the rehearsals, but the rehearsals themselves I sometimes disliked.\n\nI was getting the feeling that my lack of skill playing the drums was getting the band down. The band broke up after 2 years, played three songs in one of the amateur concerts. I still blame myself for failing them. But communicating with them gave me pleasure.\n\n### Church of Satan.\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/xThuWk5MZglNP8IsJG.gif\n\nI've never been religious.\nOne day it so happened that I was carried by some away articles and the book \"Church Satan\" that I found on the Internet. So I soon became well versed in the sect (I still keep granted by them, the so-called \"certificate\" as a memory). And then, I began to take an active and more active role in this church.\n\nI was the first who made an unofficial website, for which I was honored with awards and praise. I was the first who wrote a skeptical analysis of the Bible. And my critiques were very popular! Actually, thanks to them that I became known.\n\nAnd then I began to get to know ones of the elders. With me, I remember, I spoke to some journalists, a student who wrote some work, theologians, members of the new sect, and anyone with an interest. Probably because I was often on the network. After all, I have never been a part from the college and at home, and did nothing.\n\nBut then, I and several other members became disillusioned, and I left the sect.\n\nAnd then there were various attempts to find myself, I was changing lifestyles and views on life.\n\nWhy did I write this? All of the above has given me some experience in dealing with people and the ability to understand who I am and why, to find my place in life.\n\nPagan Old Believers tried invite me to come, and then I almost became a skinhead.\n\n> \"What people call life - just a game, but this game is sometimes instructive, and all that it teaches - only lessons from which to borrow wisdom, therefore, ought to live.\" (C)\n\n# Loneliness gave me the alternative to communion, namely: I read a lot of books, of which learned many new things from psychology, philosophy, spirituality and languages.\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/AbuQeC846WKOs.gif\n\nHave you noticed that being in society and when in the company of others, you do not crave training or self-development? I see this for myself when my brother visits me. I do not read books, I do not ponder any situation and theory, I just talk and spend time with my brother. Loneliness provides an incentive for development. With the help of loneliness, you really will begin to appreciate the friendship and fellowship.\n\n# This can be compared with food delicacies. If you eat delicacies every day, they will cease to be so desirable and unusual, and they will become commonplace.\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/WmEvcZna75UfS.gif\n\n# Now.\n\nMy current way of life is very similar to Tantric Buddhism, although it is not defined by that as it has no name, and does not need to be defined as such.\n\n# Sometimes it's painful and unpleasant to look at people.\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/JsL3hYFdvMMSs.gif\n\nI understand why they are themselves, why they have such a way of life, but I do not want to be like them and be with them in the same company. I do not like it.\n\nI never offend for a reason, I never attack, and I do no harm.\nEmpathy - what distinguishes us from animals.\n\nI value every life, no matter what that life is.\nI do not accept what most people love.\nI do everything consciously, extracting meaning and benefits from the experience.\nFor example, I have a meal. I do not eat garbage food, because it does not give to my body anything useful, since it does not contain nutrients. \n\n# I do not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or do drugs.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd that is why people around me laugh or look at me quizzically. They say that I'm lying, sick, abnormal, or \"mother does not allow\". They say, \"in life need one needs to try everything!\" \n\nBut none of them for some reason, do not try, for example, quantum physics, a healthy lifestyle, or Buddhism.\n\n**In life, need to not only try, but also try not to try!**\n\n# I do not live with the people, but I live among the people.\n\nIf only you knew how hard all of this is ... I have to hide it all, and to adapt to the \"generally accepted norms\", in order not to be mocked. \n\nI feel somehow alien among the people. I have to wear a mask to resemble the people and not be detected.\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/QG0th9DNdRrGw.gif\n\n> \"No pyramids of authority.\nMaster has an older brother, nothing more. And he just does the hard work that the others do not overpower. If it is otherwise, then trouble is inevitable.\nAuthority - this is a mistake \"(c).\n\nIf you have read Orwell's novel \"1984\" or watched the same film, you know, all this is happening in my country.\nPeople poisoned by propaganda, people are trying to survive, they are afraid of the authorities and freedom.\nAll this is laid bare and exacerbated in human animal instincts. The principle of flocks. Not like us - the enemy is dangerous, you need to avoid, or to die.\n\nThe population cannot tolerate dissent, any manifestation of freedom, something different from their lifestyle and worldview. In connection with this, people with a different lifestyle, look, worldview and way, becomes an object of ridicule, an outcast, a threat, an enemy.\n\nIt's not comfortable for me to live here. But leave (until the border has not yet closed) there is no possibility. It is very expensive, and I make incredibly low wages, and wages continue to fall, while food and services continue to rise in price.\n\nHow I would like live in a free country! Be yourself, do not hide anything, not trying to make excuses for my views and lifestyles.\n\nMaybe relocation to another country could change something in me, but I notice, positive emotions in me less and less and I feel less joy and desire to live.\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/eR2OWX51qesIo.gif\n\n-Secret Writer\n\nImages and gifs: All images are by Stellabelle, all gifs are from giphy.com.",

I think ultimately Western Union and the like may actually choose or adopt a name that includes something like \"Dollar\". Lol\nhttps://s19.postimg.org/4y9g66xo3/Bitcoinripplebanner1.png\n\nI have said to different friends over the last year or so on occasion, that I fear Western Union is about to die by Bitcoin's hand. I compare Netflix, Youtube, Google Play, Itunes,and so forth killing retail establishments like Blockbuster video. Technology and the convenience it brings, easily dominates any industry, ask Kodak. \n\n I have friends who still have to purchase money orders to pay their rent. The Apartment complex refuses personal checks and apparently doesn't want employee's accepting cash. You can join their site online for a $50 per month fee and connect your checking account. What a ripoff!  \nWow if they only knew of bitcoin and the coming technology.\nhttps://s19.postimg.org/743r0p14j/725_Ly9jb2lud_GVs_ZWdy_YXBo_Lm_Nvb_S9zd_G9y_YWdl_L3_Vwb_G9h.jpg\n\n\nhttps://s19.postimg.org/fc5olot0z/e873eec95dbe6437e8b73f6dc4b474e6.jpg\nhttps://s19.postimg.org/d2hkaxk37/a9ee5c9045261e324670df9b5e3fbf0c.png\n Western Union was in discussions with Ripple Labs early last year, regarding a blockchain pilot project.  By using a cheap payment network, proponents claim that companies will be able to cut down the cost of remittances.\n The following quote from Barry Gilbert , the Digital Currency Insights Founder and CEO  says it best:\n\u201cIf you look at Western Union and Moneygram, they have a fantastic opportunity to take advantage of bitcoin as a financial rail and incorporate it into their business.\u201d\n\nAfter reading the following article just now, I will have to say  that I think someone like Western Union may be the key player in bringing Bitcoin to the masses!

Now that payouts are daily, the trending page shows the highest valued posts.  It will probably be made the default page soon.\n\n## Payout Time Sort Order\nWe added a new [payout time](/cashout) sort order that allows you to see which posts are about to be paid out.  This should give everyone one last chance to up/down vote a post before payouts become irreversible.\n\n## New Downvote Button\nDownvote button has been replaced with a flag in the top right corner of each post. This makes it clear that downvotes should be used to flag content for abuse more than to just push someone else down.\n\n## Payout Status \nYou can now inspect a posts payout status by clicking on the pending payout amount.  It will tell you when a post is scheduled to payout and how much it has been paid in the past.\n\nEnjoy!",

Many people have made this claim to me during recent interviews. They stated it with such certainty that I didn\u2019t dare correct them on the spot.\n\nI believe this myth has its origin in the defense of proof of work relative to proof of stake blockchains.   The argument is that without proof of work anyone could rewrite the history of the blockchain.  The erroneous conclusion is that proof of work makes the blockchain irreversible.\n\n## What Makes it Irreversible \n\nThere are three things that make a blockchain irreversible:\n\n1. hash-linked blocks \n2. public record \n3. public opinion \n\nThe reality is that blockchain irreversibility comes from a public broadcast where many independent observers have recorded the same events. These events are hash-linked which means the public cannot change one event without changing *everything* that happened after it.  If someone wants to change the history, then everyone would see it is a change. Public opinion would be firmly behind the original order of events because any other history would be a lie.\n\nYou will notice that there is no need for computationally expensive proof of work to ensure the record is irreversible. You just need enough independent parties who agree on a common history.\n\n## Immutable is independent from Irreversible \n\nA blockchain may log all events into an immutable record, but a record is meaningless on its own. What gives a record value is people\u2019s opinion and perception.  This means that people can choose to ignore or reinterpret the ledger without actually changing the ledger. \n\n### Ethereum is Reversing Transactions\n\nThe fact that Ethereum, a proof of work blockchain, is reversing the effects of a transaction is proof that having an immutable record doesn\u2019t make transactions immutable.  The people who use Ethereum have collectively decided to reinterpret the immutable history in such a way that produces a better outcome for almost everyone. \n\n## Value of Proof of Work\n\nProof of work provides an objective metric of value invested (sunk cost).  This objective metric can be used to authenticate with high probability that a certain history had the backing of public opinion.  Without the backing of public opinion the values represented by the data would be worthless.  Hence, proof of work is strong evidence of public opinion, but not absolute proof.  \n\n\n## Root of Confusion \nThis may be the root of the confusion. People are mixing up the evidence with the thing the evidence is proving.  This would be like someone claiming that a particular set of finger prints cause murders. A person murders someone, the finger prints are just evidence.\n\nLikewise, public opinion secures immutability and proof of work is just the evidence that someone believed the public opinion placed value on something in the past.",

If you think Steem is only here to serve the niche of social media, then I consider this you wakeup call. The Steem blockchain is already capable of supporting every kind of blockchain application you can conceive.  Best of all, you don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to start building your app today!\n\nThink of your favorite blockchain application.  Is it [Auger](https://www.augur.net/) with is prediction markets?  Is it The DAO?  Is it general purpose smart contracts?  Is it Dash with its privacy features? Is it decentralized voting or DNS?  All of these things are possible on Steem today and you don\u2019t need Steemit\u2019s permission to do it.\n\n## Subchains not Sidechains\n\n[Sidechains](https://gendal.me/2014/10/26/a-simple-explanation-of-bitcoin-sidechains/) have been the go-to solution for adding features to the Bitcoin protocol.  The general concept is that the Bitcoin blockchain doesn\u2019t need to know what happens on the side-chain so long as it can verify transfers into and out of the side chain.\n\nImplementing side chains is challenging. It requires synchronizing two independent, potentially forking, eventually consistent blockchains.  An issue on either chain can greatly disrupt the whole system. \n\nA **subchain** is a new description for an old idea.  Mastercoin and [CounterParty](http://counterparty.io/) are what I would consider **subchains**. All of their data is included on the Bitcoin blockchain.  If Bitcoin forks, then the subchain follows.  \n\nIn other words, a subchain is just a secondary interpretation of data on the main chain.  Historically subchains haven\u2019t been practical because they are necessarily slower than the chain they run on. Bitcoin makes it very expensive to include data and every subchain operation requires Bitcoin fees to be paid.\n\n## Power of Steem Subchains\n\nOn Steem everything is different.  There are no transaction fees and it is trivial to include arbitrary data on the blockchain.  Here are some of the key benefits to subchains on Steem.\n\n1. Advanced Account Structures \n2. Pre-validated Account Authorities on Custom Operations\n3. No Transaction Fees \n4. Fast Block Times\n5. [TaPoS](http://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Uploads/TransactionsAsProofOfStake10.pdf) (Transactions as Proof of Stake)\n\nWhat this means is that it is trivial to write custom applications as fully independent subchains.  These applications don\u2019t need to worry about the complexities of network infrastructure nor do they even require access to money.  \n\nThe advanced account structures means you can have multi-sig authority involving dozens of independent agents deterministically evaluating the custom operations on the Steem blockchains.  These agents can then deterministically generate and sign transactions for processing withdraws from the subchain. The fast block times means that subchains don\u2019t have to wait long for confirmation before they can reliably create and sign transactions. The TaPoS feature ensures that transactions are only valid on a specific fork for a very short period of time.  \n\n## Smart Contracts \n\nIt is fully possible to deploy an Ethereum Virtual Machine as a subchain on Steem.  This Subchain could leverage the same algorithm Steem uses to ration bandwidth in order to ration computation.  \n\nPerhaps more interesting is the fact that multiple types and instances of virtual machines can be run on the Steem network at the same time.  \n\n## Conclusion\n\nEverything you think you like about other blockchain platforms can be implemented as a Steem Subchain.  These subchains would almost certainly be faster, easier to use, and cheaper than anything else out there.  Critically, these subchains would have easy access to the vast and growing user base of Steem.  \n\nWhat could be better?",

      "body": "<center>http://s3.amazonaws.com/livebitcoinnews/2015/12/30181644/scaling-bitcoin-600x330.jpg</center>\nI recently read an article by @eeks titled  \"[Steemit is Bitcoin's Killer App](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@eeks/steemit-is-bitcoin-s-killer-app-or-evidence-numbers-and-analysis)\".  I think it is a great article and contains a lot of truth in the short term.  But reading it got me thinking. Bitcoin may not be able to maintain its position of gateway to the altcoin world.\n\n## The Block Size Problem \n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is currently at its maximum capacity. Fees are rising.  Bitcoin supports about 300K transactions per day.  This means that Bitcoin can only support 9 million people making one transaction per month. Going through an altcoin exchange requires at least 1 bitcoin transaction from an altcoin exchange to a bitcoin/fiat exchange.  \n\n## Steem User Growth\n\nSteem has the potential to grow faster and reach farther than any prior crypto. It is entirely conceivable that Steem could reach millions of people in the next year. If these people were to use Bitcoin as a gateway to buy in and/or cash out each month then it could more than saturate Bitcoin's capacity all by itself.   \n\nEven if Bitcoin doubles its block size, the combination of existing transactions and any new transactions generated by Steem users would saturate the network.  Market forces and transaction fees would cause people to bypass Bitcoin.  There is no reason for Steem users to get into Bitcoin except speculation when Steem Dollars are available for savings and commerce.  \n\n## Steem onboards people to Steem\n\nThe people Steem reaches that Bitcoin couldn't will still have no use for most of the other cryptocurrency projects.  Just because Steem is a cryptocurrency doesn't make learning the value of Steem the same as learning the value of Bitcoin and other crypto projects. People want STEEM because of what it does *for them*.   The value proposition of other cryptocurrencies remains unchanged.\n\n<center>http://cdn.phys.org/newman/gfx/news/hires/2013/slowtoarrive.jpg</center>\n\nIn fact onboarding users through Steem may make converting them to Bitcoin even harder. It would be like onboarding someone to a high-speed bullet train and thinking that it would in turn onboard them to old school wood burning steam trains. It is easy to convert people from old trains to new trains, it just doesn't work the same the other way around.\n\n<center>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RpFhB6ZeLG4/maxresdefault.jpg</center>\n\nIf Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies wish to benefit from Steem's attraction of new people to cryptocurrency, then they will need to solve the scalability problem much faster than previously anticipated.  Failure to scale means the market could pass them by all together.",

The system will start out simple and get more advanced as things progress.    \n\n## Here is what you need to know:\n\n1. If you constantly get downvoted your posts will be marked as spam and hidden unless a user clicks to reveal all spam.  \n2. If you do not earn any positive reputation by contributing to the discussion then your votes will be ignored in our ranking algorithm.\n3. If you do not have positive reputation then you will not be able to impact the reputation of others.  \n4. If you have a negative reputation then your posts will be excluded from the global index pages\n\nNone of these changes require hardforks, but all of them will impact the user experience on Steemit.com\n\n## But what about Censorship?\n\nYou have a right to say what you want, but users have the right to plug their ears.  All of your content will be available on the blockchain and will be visible to those who want to see it (unless we are required by law to take it down).   \n\nWe will not hide / filter any content that has greater than $0.02 pending payout.  If something is deemed valuable enough to be paid, then it will be displayed.\n\nAll of your comments, blogs, etc will remain visible on your own profile page.  \n\n## Use the Mute Button\n\nIf you are tired of seeing posts by people, use the mute button.  We will gradually incorporate the mute / follow information to better filter / sort content for users.    The mute button will not hide posts with pending payouts.  If you see someone you have muted with a pending payout then flag it.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe abuse you see today will not last long term and is an artifact of rapid growth.  We fully believe that our stake-weighted reputation system will ultimately be more powerful than those available on other platforms.",

I was going to reply to him in the comments, but thought that it deserved a full post.\n\nI will summarize my primary take aways:\n\n1. Don\u2019t vilify Bots, there are real people behind them\n2. For many people this is a \u201cgame\u201d to make money while they can\n3. For other people this is an \u201cinvestment\u201d to make a lot of money long term\n4. Incentives create the bot situation\n\nI saw several proposed solutions:\n\n1. Restrict access to web socket api\n2. Remove stake-weighted voting (use hot rather than trending)\n3. Help people improve their bots\n\n\nHere are the primary things that william was missing:\n\n1. Sybil attacks - bot operators are already doing this by creating a large number of accounts and vote spamming\n2. Evil People - these people wish to do as much harm as possible because they enjoy hurting others \n3. Stupid People - these people harm others while getting no benefit for themselves\n\n## Strong Reputation and Identity \n\nThe only solutions to Sybil are Reputation, Identity, and Stake Weighted voting.  Once we solve the identity / reputation issue then it becomes much harder to create dummy accounts.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI have a ton of respect for the stance william made and will certainly attempt to incorporate what I can from it into the solutions we deploy.  Nothing in life is ever as easy as it seems, and william\u2019s proposed solutions would be at most a short term issue.  \n\nThere are people who are motivated to act in ways that break other peoples toys just because it is fun.",

Among those updates are the addition of a single digit score next to your name.  My score is an 8.\n\nReputation scores work like earthquake richter scales, they operate on log base 10.  In other words a reputation level 8 is 10 times stronger than reputation level 7.    Likewise, -8 is 10 times more negative than -7.\n\nThose with weaker reputations are unable to harm the reputation of those with strong reputation. \n\nThis score is a simple algorithm that could be changed at any time and will be tweaked.  If there are problems with it or if it starts to be gamed, then we will fix it.  \n\nWe have already identified one bug that will be fixed at the next update.  \n\nIf you feel you have been unfairly punished by the current algorithm, then you can appeal on slack.  Less than 2% of all accounts are currently being filtered due to reputation.  \n\n| Reputation |  Number of Accounts |\n|----------------| -----------------------------|\n| 9 | 1 |\n| 8 |  86 |\n| 7 | 712 |\n| 6 | 1500 |\n| 5 | 1617 |\n| 4 | 1910 |\n| 3 | 1780 |\n| 2 | 1609 |\n| 1 | 34,455 |\n| -1 | 106 |\n| -2 | 120 |\n| -3 | 98 |\n| -4 | 193 |\n| -5 | 116 |\n| -6 | 203 |\n| -7 | 16 |\n| -8 | 1  |\n\nThe lowest rep is @wang, being the first bot got him singled out by a lot of downvoters over time.   We appriciate the service wang provided and he earned some good money from his efforts.",

      "body": "<center>https://99robots.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/website-security-lock.jpg</center>\nThe past couple of months have been full of hard lessons for everyone in the cryptocurrency space.  Bugs in the DAO code lead to hard forks of ETH which lead to Replay Attacks and now a market battle between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.  \n\nIn the process the DAO hacker has managed to indirectly harm everyone from ETH holders to anyone doing business with Coinbase, one of many potential victims of the Replay Attack.\n\nIf the problems with Ethereum weren\u2019t enough, there are now [reports that $72 million worth of Bitcoin may have been stolen from Bitfinex](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitfinex-hacked-hongkong-idUSKCN10E0KP).\n\nEven steemit.com was hacked.  The difference is that Steem responded quickly, decisively, and with long-lasting technological solutions rather than one-time patches that do nothing to prevent future issues.\n\n## All of this is Preventable \n\nFor over 3 years I have been working to design and build next generation blockchain technologies. Steem is the product of many hard lessons in usability, scalability, and security.  Most of the lessons learned are not available on any other platform.\n\n## Preventing Replay Attacks\n\nWay back in November 2013 I introduced the concept of [Transactions as Proof of Stake](http://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Uploads/TransactionsAsProofOfStake10.pdf) also known as TaPoS.  \n\nThe idea behind TaPoS is that each time a transaction is signed it should reference a recent block ID. By referencing a recent block ID the signer is also certifying their opinion on the state of the blockchain and the pre-condition for the validity of the transaction.  \n\nOver the long term this means that every stake holder is directly certifying / checkpointing the blockchain and creates a measure of consensus that is even harder to forge than redoing all of the Proof of Work on bitcoin and \u201cmigrating\u201d the transactions.   \n\n## Preventing Rebirth of Forks \n\nAssuming a blockchain will never have to hard fork is denying reality.  Bugs will happen, new features will be needed, and lack of adaptability to market conditions will eventually kill any company, product, or cryptocurrency.   \n\nThe decision to hard fork should be baked into the consensus process prior to any fork occurring.  If consensus is reached that a fork should occur, then all nodes that do not have the code for the fork should shutdown by consensus. \n\nStated another way, the only way to \u201crevive\u201d a fork such as Ethereum Classic would be to implement a true fork and require everyone to update their code.  \n\nEthereum Classic is an example of a Fork that should never have existed. If the Ethereum blockchain had a true consensus process in place for deciding when to fork and *when to die* then the entire market could rest assured they are on the right fork.\n\nInstead decisions about which fork to adopt are handled outside of blockchain consensus and therefore chaotic in nature. Failure to provide a governance structure will lead to market chaos, uncertainty, and situations like Ethereum Classic. \n\n## Recovering from Hacks  \n\nAttempting to prevent hacks is a nobel, but futile effort.  Hacks are instant, and permanent.  Even with advanced multi-sig accounts, such as those supposedly used by Bitfinex, are unable to prevent the instantaneous loss of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe problem is that you do not know you have been hacked until it is *too late* to fix it or recover. Hackers can slowly gather keys over time and then wait until the perfect moment to strike.\n\nThe strength of a system is not measured by how thick and impenetrable the skin is, but by its ability to heal quickly after being cut. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most other blockchains have no system in place for healing.\n\n[Every Steem account is associated with a recovery account](https://steemit.com/all/@dan/steemit-releases-groundbreaking-account-recovery-solution). The recovery account can be any other user on the system who knows you by some means other than your public key.  In the event that your account is stolen, the recovery account combined with your old public key has the ability to restore the account to its rightful owner.\n\n**This is not just multi-sig**.  Multi-sig is a fixed set of signers who must cosign a transaction. The Steem recovery process considers any key used in the past 30 days to be one party to the recovery.  An attacker can change the owner keys as much as they want, it will not prevent the recovery.  \n\nYour recovery account has no power over your account without one of your recent keys and it is not needed until after you are hacked. This is very different from any multi-sig solution currently on the market. \n\nThere are only two people who can recover an account, the attacker or the legitimate owner. So long as the recovery agent does full KYC prior to recovering the account no hacker will attempt to recover.  In fact, there is no reason for the hacker to attempt recovery because they are already in control of the \"current keys\" which means they get the account by default after 30 days.\n\n## Time locked Funds \n\nThe key to security is *time*. It is impossible to know that your keys have been compromised until someone else signs something with them.  By the time they sign, it is too late.\n\nImagine if there was a 24 hour delay during which your transfer could be recovered with the help of your recovery agent.  With such a system in place a hacker would have to divulge the hack by using your keys, but would be powerless to prevent you from recovering your account and canceling the transfer.  \n\nIf the hacker managed to compromise both you and your recovery agent, then the recovery agent would go to their recovery agent first, then recover you.  This process could continue indefinitely so long as everyone could recover within the allotted time.  The probability of a hacker compromising all of those accounts at the same time is vanishingly small.\n\nAll of these things require time with the ability to cancel.  Without time delay hacks are impossible to detect until after they irreversible.  Banks have known this for a long time. They implement daily withdraw limits, 24 to 72 hour pending periods, etc.  \n\nThe vast majority of cryptocurrency wealth needs to be locked behind similar protections. The only funds that should exist as liquid \u201ccash\u201d are those which are needed immediately and which the holder of said funds can afford to lose.\n\n## Steem Solves these Problems\n\n95% of all Steem value is subject to time release, all accounts can be recovered so long as you have any owner key used in the past 30 days and the signature of your recovery agent.  All transactions implement TaPoS which prevents replay, and the decision to hard fork is built into the consensus protocol itself.  Any nodes that don\u2019t know the details of the hard-fork will automatically shutdown at the consensus defined time. \n\nIf Bitcoin and Ethereum implemented these features then Coinbase wouldn\u2019t be suffering from Replay, Bitfinex would be able to recover their funds, and either Ethereum or Ethereum Classic would not exist.  \n\nThese features make everyone more secure, and isn\u2019t that the whole point of Cryptocurrencies in the first place? What good is a cryptocurrency that is statistically less secure than the funds in your bank?  It is time for a change.",

      "body": "The Steem Dollar will trend toward a dollar's worth of steem.  Because Price and Quantity are always tied together, the value of a Steem Dollar falls below when the demand to sell is greater than the demand to buy.  Likewise, it rises when the demand to buy is greater than the demand to sell.\n\nAny discount you see is the premium people are paying for Liquidity because they are in a HURRY to sell.   Arbitrage is performed by those who are more patient, they buy low ($0.80 and sell high $1.00 or more).    \n\nIn other words, the market is sorting out supply and demand and will keep steem dollars near $1.00  over wide variations on STEEM prices.\n\nRight now, on the internal market you can use SD to buy STEEM at about the current price.  Therefore, it is holding very well.",

      "body": "<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/PageRank-hi-res.png</center>\n\nBuilding a decentralized economic platform that uses voting to distribute funds is extremely challenging.  On the one hand everyone wants to \u201cvote selfishly\u201d to give themselves the most reward possible, on the other hand large stake holders want to vote in a manner that maximizes the value of the currency.\n\nThe solution employed by Steem uses the principle that individuals acting alone shouldn\u2019t have much power, but the more people that work together the more power they have collectively.  In other words, two people voting together is more than twice as powerful as either voting alone.\n\nThe end result is a system that is working relatively well at today\u2019s scale.   The challenge Steem faces now is that large stakeholders, aka whales, have enough stake to unilaterally allocate far more than even the largest group of smaller users.\n\nThis means that whales need to spread their votes across 1000 times as much content as normal users or refrain from voting all together.  Allocation of rewards will be highly concentrated among those the whales give attention to, but the attention of whales is finite. The finite limits of whale attention limits the scalability of reward distribution.\n\n## Existing Solutions\n\nSome savvy whales, such as @smooth, are actively hiring people to process content and vote on their behalf.  This is a very involved process and ultimately limited to a few people able to operate bots, manage teams, and check up on people.\n\nEven with everything @smooth is doing, there is only so much content that his team of curators can process.  \n\n## Bad Voters \n\nNot all voters are good voters, and this applies to whales too.  Sometimes accounts can go rogue, get hacked, or otherwise start acting in ways that harm the wider community.  When a small stakeholder goes bad the system can safely ignore their votes and hide their posts with a reputation score, but when a whale goes bad things are not so easy.\n\n## Scalable Voting \n\nWhat we need is a scalable solution for managing distributed authority over the printing presses and deciding which content is most worthy to be promoted.  The root of all authority must be derived from stakeholder Steem Power or Sybil attacks will quickly undermine the algorithm.\n\nIn the late 90\u2019s Google faced a similar problem with websites.  They invented an algorithm that could rank web pages by using links as votes.  This algorithm worked extremely well until SEO hackers learned how to game the system using what is essentially a Sybil attack. \n\nGoogle gave every page one vote that it could divide among every page it linked to.  The algorithm would the use these votes to identify the highest authority, quality, most visited, or most popular pages.  \n\n## Delegated Voting via Account Rank \n\nIf you view each account as having 1 web page per unit of Steem Power controlled by that account, and you let each account link to other accounts that they trust to allocate funds and curate content then the result is a massively recursive delegated voting system.  Allowing links to have positive and negative weights means that everyone has the power to contribute to filtering the \u201cgood\u201d people from the \u201cbad\u201d people.  \n\nSo long as there are many more \u201cgood\u201d people than \u201cbad\u201d people, the bad actors are quickly neutralized by having more negative links than positive links.\n\nThis system is immune to the Sybil attack faced by Google\u2019s PageRank algorithm because the supply of \u201cpages\u201d is restricted by the available Steem Power.    \n\n## Account Rank on a Blockchain \n\nThe page rank algorithm is a computationally intensive iterative process that is normally performed by large clusters of computers using massively parallel map-reduce algorithms.  A blockchain is required to reach consensus quickly and is ultimately single threaded because every transaction has the potential to impact the consensus state relevant to every transaction after it.\n\nIn order to efficiently implement Account Rank on a blockchain we must first place an upper limit on the largest possible blocking calculation.  The computation complexity of calculating the Account Rank of an individual account grows linearly with the number of links (votes) an account gives or receives. \n\nFortunately, we know that there is a natural limit to the number of people someone can maintain stable relationships with.  This is known as [Dunbar\u2019s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number).   By studying social group size in primates Dunbar was able to conclude that at most 150 stable relationships.   Beyond this size more restrictive social rules are required.\n\nWe can use this information to naturally limit the number of trust-links allowed among accounts to something that ordinary people are actually capable of.  \n\nOnce we have limited the number of links it is simply a matter of spreading the calculation over time and prioritizing calculations that will effect the biggest changes.   So long as the rate at which links can change is slower than the rate at which the algorithm can reach equilibrium then on average the network will remain close enough to equilibrium to accomplish the desired goal.\n\n## Alternative to Witness Voting\n\nUsing the Account Rank algorithm we could replace and eliminate the overhead associated with tracking and tallying witness votes.  Instead the witnesses would be the top accounts by Account Rank that didn\u2019t opt out of being a witness.  Each account is currently allowed 30 witness votes, this memory could be repurposed to serve the Account Rank algorithm.  Likewise, every time an account\u2019s Steem Power changes all 30 witness votes are updated. These calculations could be replaced with Account Rank propagation calculations.  \n\nOver all this would increase user engagement in voting for peers and provide a more liquid and representative ranking of user trust and reputation within the network while adding only a small amount of additional overhead and simplifying witness selection.\n\nEach user would simply add their 30 most trusted curators (aka friends) to their account and the Account Rank algorithm will automatically distribute influence among the friends.  This would result in trust flowing outward from whales and down to more people who currently don\u2019t have much voice or curation power.  \n\nMore people acting with more power due to delegated trust lines automatically rebalanced by Account Rank means that rewards can be distributed more fairly because there are more people with power and attention to process posts.\n\nNegative weights would allow the network to quickly remove voting influence from accounts that earn a reputation for bad behavior. This is something the current Steem algorithms require a voting bot war that generates unwanted collateral damage. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith careful implementation and planning, it should be possible to upgrade Steem to have a far more liquid, democratic, and secure web of trust.  This web of trust can then more reliably be used to allocate rewards in the best interest of the whole platform while scaling to handle millions of people.\n\n***Note*** - this idea is presented for discussion purposes only and does not represent a commitment to implement at this point in time.  There may be unresolved technical challenges to realizing this algorithm.",

      "body": "<center>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/PageRank-hi-res.png</center>\nYesterday I [released an article where I suggested that the Page Rank algorithm used by Google might be a viable alternative to the current voting system](/steem/@dantheman/people-rank-using-page-rank-algorithm-for-better-curation-and-rewards). Today I would like to add some additional insights that I have had.\n\nUsing a simple [page rank simulator](http://faculty.chemeketa.edu/ascholer/cs160/WebApps/PageRank/) I played around with various graph structures to get a better understanding of the graph theory and behavior of Page Rank.\n\nWhat I discovered is that in a world where everyone is equal, those who create links amongst themselves gain weight relative to those who do not cross link.  I also discovered that those who give links without receiving lose direct influence, though they may gain via indirect influence.\n\n## Negative Weights don't Work\n\nUsing Page Rank you cannot have edges with negative weights, this means that it is not possible have your voting influence countered, especially if you are a bad whale.   \n\n## Variation on Page Rank - Recursive Delegated Voting\n\nMany people have been asking for the ability to delegate VESTS to other users who could then use those VESTS to cast votes.  To really work well, it should be possible to redelegate your votes an infinite number of times.  With delegated voting it should also be possible to \"cancel out\" someone else's vote with your own vote.  This is already possible with bot wars, but with delegated negative voting we can bypass the network spam.\n\n## Scalability \n\nThis algorithm has many of the same scalability considerations as Page Rank.  This means that each account would be limited in the number of accounts it could delegate to.  Furthermore, there would need to be a minimal delegated amount.\n\n## Benefits \nIf implemented it would be relatively trivial to police vote spammers as well as those who would abuse the power of negative voting to silence legitimate voters.\n\nWhales would be able to delegate their VESTS to other users who can use the increased influence to provide better curation and increase the value of the VESTS.  \n\n## The Evil Whale Problem \n\n<center>http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/4/4a/Monstro_smash.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20071017224248</center>\n\nWe live in a world filled with evil whales.  The power elite who control our economy and the printing presses are willing to risk burning down the economy to increase their power and wealth.  Their interests are clearly not aligned with the masses.\n\nWhile Steem is young and has significant upside growth potential and relatively little economic power, the easiest way for whales to grow their power, wealth, and influence is to work with everyone else.  Once Steem achieves a level of entrenchment similar to Facebook, Twitter, etc, the whales can misbehave with relative impunity because everyone is \"locked in\".  \n\nIt is critical that the masses of dolphins, minnows, and good whales, have the power to efficiently neutralize bad actors for the benefit of all.  I am committed to building a system that empowers people who work for the benefit of all and disempowers those who attempt to work against the best interest of the wider community.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCreating a distributed, self-governing, mob that works reliably to allocate resources for the betterment of the whole rather than the individual is challenging.  As the stakes are raised it becomes increasingly difficult to prevent abuse. Recursive Delegated Voting is a variation on Page Rank that might just do the trick.\n\nI would like to thank everyone who has participated in yesterday's discussion.",

The existence of curation rewards does the following for whales:\n\n- encourages reckless voting because the rate of return on voting on random comments is very high for the whale.    Effectively, the whale spends $100 of community money and pockets $25.   The $75 cost is socialized, but the $25 is privatized.   \n- the probability of being early on popular \"good\" content and getting an even higher rate of return is not higher than the \"sure thing\" of any random thing a whale could vote on.\n- any attempt to impose per-account caps will result in sybil attacks \n- good whales must vote as prolifically as evil whales or the evil whales will overcome them.\n- any attempt to implement stake delegation for voting purposes is disincentivized by the curation reward algorithm unless curation rewards propagate back.  This backward propagation is both difficult to implement and ultimately irrelevant considering points 2.\n\nIn other words, the curation reward system may be fundamentally broken and should be discarded.

      "body": "<center> http://zidbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Kamikaze-Helmet11.jpg </center>\n\nDemocracy is filled with mythology. [Larken Rose](https://steemit.com/politics/@larkenrose/political-mythology-101-part-one) has recently covered many of these myths.  Today I would like to introduce a new concept that may totally change how some people perceive democracy.\n\n## Voting Theory\n\nPopular political theology around voting is that each individual has the right to vote for anything, for any reason, and in complete secrecy. Education, knowledge, race, and inelegance are not legitimate prerequisites.  It goes so far as to say that through voting the entire constitution and every human right can be violated.\n\nThere are many different kinds of voting that attempt to capture public opinion accurately.  Systems include plurality, instant runoff, majority, and proportional representation.  Each system has its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nBeing an Anarchist, I like to work from first principles.  If I assume the popular political theology is morally acceptable means of making decisions regarding what people may or may not do, then I would like to add a new voting system and means of fully \u201cexpressing ones vote\u201d that I feel would truly capture a legitimate outcome.\n\nIn other words, if all people are equal and entitled equal weight to vote for what ever they want, for what ever reason they want to, then it should be possible to express your opinion as the exact opposite of someone else. This is a perfectly valid opinion and deserves as much respect as their opinion.  After all, you could just as easily say that they are the one who is adopting an opinion opposite to your own.  It is not possible to say who is positive and who is negative, they are merely reflections of equal value with no beginning and no end.  \n\nThe act of negating someone else\u2019s opinion does not require you to know their opinion, because you are free to change your opinion to counter theirs as fast as they can change their opinion.  The outcome will always result in a net vote of 0.  \n\n## Anarchist Husband and his Political Wife\n\nImagine an anarchist named John adopted a [position against voting](https://steemit.com/elections/@jaredhowe/against-voting) and was against voting completely.  Unfortunately for Jared, he married a hard core political activist who believes in democracy.\n\u2028John and his wife have a huge fight about whether they should vote and if so, who they should vote for. John recognizes that the only two candidates with a chance of winning are evil and agree on the important issues.  John\u2019s wife has an opinion on which one is \u201cless evil\u201d.  \n\nJohn wants to protest the election by not voting, but his wife believes she must do *something* to combat the *more evil* option. \n\nJohn then comes up with an idea, he decides to cast his vote to be the exact opposite of his wife\u2019s.  He goes to his wife and asks who she is voting for, she tells him.  He then informs her that he will vote for the other candidate.  \n\nA brief fight ensues about how the other guy is *more evil*, but ultimately she concedes that he has a right to vote how ever he wants.   \n\nAfter she accepts reality, John suggests that they can both stay home this election because their votes will now cancel out.  They could drive to the polls, spend their time and gas money in order to cast a neutral vote for two evil candidates, or they could stay home and have a drink without feeling dirty for supporting the lessor of two evils. \n\nAny *rational* couple would choose to stay home.  They have nothing to gain by casting opposing votes and nothing to lose by not casting their vote. All of the usual arguments for voting fall apart:\n\n### You have no right to complain if you didn\u2019t try.\nWell that isn\u2019t true, you did try, but someone else negated your vote.  Both parties can legitimately say they \u201ctried\u201d but their vote wouldn\u2019t have been the tie breaker. \n\n### Higher turnout makes democracy more representative .\nWell you both could have turned out, but the amount of raw information you would contribute would be identical to if you both didn\u2019t show up.  If every non-voter was modeled as a purely random voter, then the amount your opposing votes do nothing.  If you model non-voter\u2019s as voting with the ratio as voters then the only thing your votes would do is reduce the percentage spread between the two candidates by an imperceptible amount.\n\n### Even a vote for a third Party can have an impact\nUnless there is a 3rd party who you actually can support, all you would be doing is voting for evil.   Suppose John\u2019s wife really liked a 3rd party candidate, she is now left with a choice: let John vote for the most evil candidate while she votes for someone who will lose, or not vote at all.  \n\n### Voting is a Right Generations Struggled to Win\n\nAnd based upon this right John and his wife have nullified their influence.  It is John\u2019s right to oppose his wife\u2019s vote and therefore his wife\u2019s vote is now meaningless. Democracy wins! \n\n## Secret Ballots prevent John\u2019s Blackmail  \n\nIn theory John\u2019s wife could lie to John about who she intends to vote for.  This would make it impossible to be 100% sure the he was countering his wife\u2019s vote.  She could \u201ctrick him\u201d into inadvertently siding with her choice of lessor evil.\n\nThis is true, but John could also lie.  \n\nUltimately the joke is on John\u2019s wife because it isn\u2019t who votes that counts, it is who counts the vote.  In this case, the secret ballot means that John\u2019s wife cannot prove her vote was accurately counted.\n\nUnfortunately, secret ballots also prevent John from casting his true opinion and thus effectively deny him the right to vote.\n\n## Smart Ballots\n\nWhat if John could express his desire to counter his wife\u2019s vote by casting a ballot that would automatically vote for the candidate opposite of his wife without having to know her vote?  In this case there is no need to reveal who you will vote for and there is no ability to cheat.\n\nIf you could cast such a ballot then the entire voting system could be revamped.  Each person would have the option to either cast a ballot or to negate someone else\u2019s right to cast a ballot.  Once you have been negated no one else may negate you.\n\nThose who are politically outspoken would quickly get negated by people who don\u2019t like what they stand for. After all, it is much easier to vote against something you don\u2019t like than to vote *for* something you do like.   This means that anyone that ever expresses any ideas disliked by a passive observer would get nullified.\n\nThe final outcome would be an election decided by those who have managed to escape without offending anyone.  One thing is for certain, anyone who goes near the polls would be quickly negated by someone else, the mere act of voting would become offensive! \n\n## In a Rational World\u2026 \n\nPeople would realize that democracy and voting were adopted as a proxy for war and violence. Rather than having two armies fight to the death, they would simply count their numbers and assume the larger army would win and get their way.  This seems logical and avoids a lot of unnecessary bloodshed.\n\nHow you count the votes makes a huge difference, especially when there are complex factors and decisions.  You cannot assume that everyone voting for a candidate actually supports that candidate, they have merely formed an alliance under the principle of \u201can enemy of my enemy is my friend\u201d.  That principle hardly turns a lessor enemy into your representative. \n\nIn reality there are not two armies battling it out, there are thousands of armies each with their own opinion.  If you want to properly simulate the war, then each person needs to find one other person to take out in a Kmakazi battle to the death.  \n\nWhen the dust settles from the simulated war you will have a few people left standing.  These are the people whom no one else felt was a priority to take out.  Each person would rationally take out the \u201cgreatest evil\u201d they could find and everyone else is considered better. It would mean that who ever won the war would be \u201cbetter\u201d than the evil they just eliminated. A true vote against the greatest of all evils.\n\nObviously, if this process were adopted the entire mirage of democracy would disappear.  If the population was odd, then one person would be left standing, if even then no one would win.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf we were to use a legitimate voting system that accurately reflected the moral principle behind each individuals \u201cright to vote\u201d by allowing individuals to fully express their \u201cright to counter someone else\u2019s vote\u201d then we would end up in complete anarchy as no law could pass except by unanimous consent of people no one had reason to oppose.\n\nIf man does not have a right to counter balance another man in the political system, then the game is rigged.  His right to cast a vote that expresses his wishes has been denied. He has been given a false choice rather than a free choice.   After all, if you cannot express a vote that is exactly opposite of someone else, then that means not all opinions are on the table.  It means that the people who get to decide the options are the rulers, not the voters.\n\nYou can vote for any color car you want so long as it is black.",

      "body": "<center>http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Democracy/RTV/restoreRTV.PNG</center>\n\nIn my [last article I introduced the concept of smart ballots](/politics/@dantheman/what-would-smart-ballots-and-kamikaze-voters-mean-to-democracy) that would automatically vote the opposite of a person of your choosing while maintaining full secrecy of their vote. Many people joined the discussion to critique its failure under a system with more than two choices.  Today, I would like to dive deeper into the concept and expose more fallacies of the popular voting theology.\n\n## Voting is a Fundamental Human Right\n\nThis is the foundation of all democracy and the starting point of any discussion.  Unfortunately, this statement doesn\u2019t specify what *kind* of voting is a fundamental human right.  If it is a human right, then where does it come from and *why* is it our right?  \n\nI decided to look into the holy books of voting theology and found some useful definitions from authoritative sources:\n\n> The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot or by equivalent free voting procedures.  - [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/b1udhr.htm)\n\nThe basis of this right appears to be that the will of the people is the basis of the authority of government.  Voting, therefore, is the means by which the people may express their will.  Interestingly enough, a person\u2019s expressed will must be kept secret according to the holy scriptures of human suffrage.  \n\nA voting system that does not allow the true *will of the people* to be expressed is one that is violating our fundamental right and therefore there is no basis for the authority of government. \n\n## The Right to Consent\n\nThe basis of the right to vote is therefore derived from the right to consent (or not) which is clearly the foundation of a free society.   Democracy is the belief that all people universally agree to consent to the will of the majority.  In other words, if more people consent than not then all people consent.\n\nUltimately all consent boils down to a simple Yes or No. Given a proposed law that will impact an individual, the will of the people requires a simple Yes or No.  \n\nSuppose the government gave the people the option to die by fire or die by ice.  This is a false dichotomy under which the will of the people is *impossible* to express.  Suppose we were given the option to nuke China or nuke Russia?  The inability of a system to express all possible opinions of will means that a government is deriving its authority to restrict the options from some other source.   \n\n## Binary Expresses All \n\nAll possible expressions of the will of the people can be represented as a body of law, which in turn can be represented as a binary number.  A binary number consists of a series of Yes and No bits. \n\nThe will of the people can therefore be perfectly measured by doing a direct poll on each bit, with the majority vote on each bit resulting in the consensus will for that bit.  Since all opinions can be represented by such a voting system and are directly measured, the will of the people can be known.   \n\nFrom this we can clearly see that any individual\u2019s vote can be fully negated by another individual\u2019s vote.  It all boils down to string of Yes/No questions and each individual has the fundamental right to vote the opposite and thus nullify the influence of another individual.\n\n## Representative Democracy\n\nDirect democracy is clearly not viable for any number of reasons.  It simply doesn\u2019t scale.  The masses of people do not have the time, energy, nor intelligence to think about everything and come to a conclusion. \n\nThis is why we have \u201crepresentative democracy\u201d, we elect someone to represent us and then trust they will work with other representatives to reach consensus.  \n\nThe right to specify someone to represent you is the mirror of the right to specify someone who represents your opposite.   By specifying your opposite, you are in effect most accurately representing yourself.   Instead of having a choice of a dozen people to represent me, I can have a choice of millions of people who most closely represent my opposite.  \n\n## Negative Representation is More Accurate and More Scalable \n\nWhen opposites collide they cancel out.  This means that it becomes trivial to express far more of who you are and what your will is. Since your will is part of the public will and is the basis for the legitimacy of government, the right to negate someone else\u2019s vote is a fundamental human right.  To deny this right is to infringe on the range of public opinion that is capable of being expressed.\n\n## Consequences \n\nAssuming a law was passed that allowed each individual to specify another individual whose vote they would like to cancel (assuming their vote was not already canceled), then the entire system would boil down to a group of voters who did not want to negate someone else's vote and who no one else wanted to negate.\n\nIn my prior article I assumed everyone would prefer to negate someone else, but that was me projecting my own bias on everyone else.  For each person who chooses to vote rather than negate there exists another person who was not negated. This means that there would still be a large body of voters whose opinions could be polled.\n\nThis body of individuals would be the least polarizing group.  A group of people whom have been pre-filtered by the masses to be the closest group of representatives that could be found.  Everyone that was eliminated was a \u201cpolar opposite\u201d of someone else and thus represent the set of least representative.    Those that remain are therefore \u201cmost representative\u201d and their subsequent votes will be more in line with the masses opinion than any other group of representatives.   \n\nThis group of voters, being much smaller, would have far more flexible voting systems available to them.  Systems that don\u2019t scale to millions of people may scale to those who remain after all of the negative representatives have been removed.  \n\nIf you believe that voting is a fundamental right derived from our human nature, then you must also hold that negative voting is the most expressive means of casting a ballot and representing yourself.   \n\nAll other definitions of the \u201cright to vote\u201d are [a statutory right or privilege granted to a person or group by a government.](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/right%20to%20vote)  However, this definition is in contradiction to the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/b1udhr.htm) which states that government authority comes from voting.  Therefore, government cannot have authority to define the source of its own authority.  If you believe government gets to set rules on voting, then you believe voting isn\u2019t a human right, but a government granted privilege that can be revoked.   In other words, you believe that government authority is derived from some other source than the will of the people expressed through voting. \n\nLet's restore the right to vote by allowing people to express their anti-representative and negate their vote.",

      "body": "<center>http://ypolitick.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/POP-the-vote.jpg</center>\nIn my past two articles I have tackled the complex theory of voting and how it applies to discovering the will of the people and ultimately the \u201cauthority\u201d of government.  There has been quite a bit of vocal resistance to my proposed idea of negating someone else\u2019s vote.  I would like to take a moment to discuss the nature of this resistance.\n\n## Negative Voting would create a Culture of Hate\n\nWhen you vote for a different candidate than your friend it isn\u2019t taken personally, but if you opt to negate your friends vote instead it suddenly becomes *very personal*.  This is probably true.  Even though the reality is that your friend is canceling your vote anyway, people irrationally feel like something has been taken from them.  \n\nThe truth is that something has been taken from them: the illusion that their vote matters.  The illusion that their opinion isn\u2019t being canceled out by some anonymous stranger on the other side of the country.  Now it is being canceled by someone with a name.\n\nThe result is misplaced anger being directed at the person who chooses to cancel you out.  No one ever stops to consider that the individual who canceled you out has just as much right to be angry at you for voting to support policies that would harm them.  Their vote has already been canceled by you!   \n\nWe currently live in a culture where people can numb themselves to the consequences of their vote.  They never have to face the victim.   You want free health care?  Great!  You just got nullified by the person who was going to have to pay for it.\n\nThe existing culture of voting is like piloting a UAV and bombing people you have never met in a distant land.  Mean while those people in a distant land are attempting to bomb you with their own UAVs.  Neither side has met one another, but both are willing to hurt each other for their own benefit.\n\nThere is bound to be less death and destruction in a society where people get to put a name and face on the individual who is countering their attempts at abuse of power.  Instead people will migrate their own public opinions toward things that don't infringe on the rights of others.  As soon as your vote or opinion violates someone else's right, you better believe it will get nullified by them.  Only those who support solutions that do not violate someone else's human right will have a chance to avoid nullification.  This will certainly create  a culture of peace and understanding, not one of hate.\n\n## A Stable Environment\n\nOnce you have identified someone whom you want to counter, there is little reason to change your opinion unless you find someone *even worse* who hasn\u2019t already been countered.  This means that over time there would be relatively little \u201cpolitics\u201d to discuss because everyone who is in violent disagreement with others has all ready been nullified.  \n\nThis means that your friends and family and almost everyone you know has probably been nullified and will be nullified by someone their entire life.  Politics, elections, and voting would not be a topic of general discussion.  \n\nIf you want your \u201cright to vote back\u201d, then all you need to do is convince the person nullifying you that there is someone even worse who isn\u2019t currently nullified.  Once the two of you reach consensus then one of you can get your ability to cast a positive vote back (the other one will nullify the greater evil).\n\n## Votes for Sale \n\nThe next point of concern is that if there is a public database of voters and who they are canceling (necessary to determine who can cast a positive vote), that people could pay others to cast negative votes.\n\nThe right to vote includes the freedom to vote for *any reason*.  Denying someone the right to vote because you don\u2019t like their *reason* is tyrannical. Everyone votes for *selfish reasons*.  It is like denying a woman the right to sell sexual services.  Her body, her vote.  \n\nThe truth is that is is cheaper to buy votes with propaganda than with direct offers of payment. Anyone willing to buy or sell their vote would probably get canceled out by someone against that practice.  At the end of the day buying and selling of voters is a free market solution to resolving political differences in a voluntary manner.\n\n## No Right to Abuse Vote\n\nThis is an interesting paradox because who gets to decide what is and isn\u2019t abuse?  Shall we vote on it?  Is a vote to declare something abuse also abuse?  This is a hypocritical position that assumes some universal standard of right and wrong.  If such a standard existed then there would be no need to vote in the first place.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPeople are irrational yet believe they are perfectly sane.  They will take personal offense any time anyone attempts to expose the disconnect between reality and their own delusions.  This isn\u2019t a reason to abandon a system of negative voting, but rather a reason to implement it.  Anything that forces people to come face to face with reality and stop hiding their violent tendencies behind an anonymous voting box will lead to a more civil society.",

      "body": "<center>http://activerain.com/image_store/uploads/2/5/8/8/2/ar130882862428852.jpg</center>\nMy past three posts have been focused entirely on political philosophy.  Unfortunately, many readers seem to think I was talking about Steem and started jumping to all kinds of unfounded conclusions.   Today I would like to actually express my opinion as it relates to Steem.\n\n## Ying and Yang \n\nAll games require balance.  An unbalanced game will eventually collapse once a certain strategy takes over and ensures a certain behavior unchecked profits.  Steem was designed with down votes on posts (flags) as a means of keeping a certain kind of bad behavior in check.\n\n## Objectively Bad Behaviors \n\nAs someone who holds to a subjective view of reality, I like to refrain from making absolute value judgements.  I also want to avoid pushing my value judgements on other people. So when I talk about objectively bad behavior I will do so without respect to the nature of content or individual voter\u2019s opinions. \n\nThe goal of Steem is to reward users proportional to the value they bring.  An objectively bad behavior is one where a user manages to get large rewards while providing others with little value.  Unfortunately, value is subjective.\n\nWhile it is hard to differentiate the relative value of two different things, I think something objective can be said for something that provides *no value*.   If we assume that all information has some positive value, then the lack of information has no value.  People casting votes communicates information.  Every post with unique content contributes information.  The value of the information provided is subjective.   \n\nA voting robot that votes \u201crandomly\u201d provides no new information.  A poster that publishes \u201crandom\u201d content also provides no new information.  It is all noise.  Some people might even say that by increasing the noise floor this kind of behavior consumes resources and destroys information and therefore could have objectively negative value.\n\nWhat we can conclude from this is that \u201cobjectively bad\u201d behavior is any behavior that can be automated using unsophisticated software and which yields the individual oversized profits.\n\n### Authors Paying themselves for Doing Nothing\n\nThis type of behavior has one user sucking value from the whole while providing no new value.  Generally speaking, this kind of behavior is discouraged by the *n*<sup>2</sup> rewards curve.  The rate of return for self-voting on garbage post is so low for most users that it isn\u2019t worth the effort.   This reward curve forces collaboration and collusion to actually get meaningful value out of the platform.\n\n**A whale is a collusive group**.   This means that a whale has enough stake to earn a huge profit by voting on their own post regardless of post quality. The only thing that keeps whales from frivolously voting on themselves is the potential to be down voted by other whales.  This creates a check and balance at the highest levels which protect the system from abuse.\n\n### Curation Rewards for Doing Nothing \n\nThis type of behavior is when a whale creates a bot that simply up votes everything from reputable users regardless of quality.   This kind of behavior can be countered by other whales only by pushing the author rewards toward 0.   \n\nSuppose a post is sitting at a $100 pending payout and a whale up votes it to $1000 with a single vote.  Other whales see that as abusive and place a counter acting down vote restoring it to $100 pending payout.   The abusive whale will get the vast majority of the $25 curation rewards on that post.\n\nWhen it comes to curation rewards the system is currently unbalanced.  There is no way to negate the profits of abusive curators. \n\n## All Abuse is Exercised by Voting \n\nAuthors cannot abuse the platform (except by spam).  It is only the voters that have the power to be \u201cgood voters\u201d or \u201cbad voters\u201d.   Rather than placing biased terms of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d I will simply assume \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d voters.  Neither red nor blue are deemed to be good or bad, they simply have a difference of opinion on where funds should be allocated.\n\nThe Steem community is continuously deciding where to allocate money.  Every voter \u201cowns\u201d a part of the Steem network with a long term vested interest in increasing its value.  \n\n### Upvote Only Economy \n\nFor the sake of simplicity lets assume budget items are voted on one at a time.  The amount something gets paid is based on how many voters vote.  Lets also assume there are only two options for voters, \u201cYES\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d.    Under this model a whale is granted unchecked, unilateral control over a large fraction of the budget.  \n\nThe financial incentives for a whale in such a position is to embezzle as much money for personal profit as he can without killing the goose laying the golden STEEM.  So long as the rate at which is stake grows is faster than the rate at which the STEEM pie shrinks, his own personal net worth will grow.  \n\nA malicious whale (hacked account, hostile takeover, etc), would short STEEM on the market and then vote to give himself as much as he could.  The STEEM he gives himself can be used to cover his short position and he makes a huge profit off of the demise of the platform.\n\n### Up and Down Vote Economy \n\nUnder an economy with both up and down votes things are different.  Each time a budget item is brought up for vote the voters have three options:  \u201cYES\u201d, \u201cNO\u201d, or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d.   Under this model anyone who votes money to themselves without providing value to everyone else will be countered with an equal or greater number of \u201cNO\u201d votes.  The system is balanced. Misallocation of funds can only occur if voters collectively allow it to happen.\n\n## Curation Rewards are an Up-vote Only Economy\n\nSomeone who up votes anything of value beyond what it is worth earns guaranteed curation profits unless others down vote the post below what it was worth.  This take value away from other curators and authors and gives robotic whale curators a unchecked easy path to profit. \n\nThe abusive whale up voter is not only gaining profits, but denying others the opportunity to earn profits by forcing them to use down votes.  \n\nIn other words, there is currently no way to \u201cdown vote\u201d an \u201cup vote\u201d and therefore, the system is unbalanced and subject to abuse.\n\n\n## Removing Down Votes from Posts \n\nAuthors get offended when their post gets down voted.  This is an irrational, but understandable human reaction.  In reality what is going on is a disagreement among voters.  Some voters think the post should be worth more, others think it should be worth less.  What if we removed the option to down vote a post?\n\n**What if instead of down voting a post, you could down vote a voter?**  When you down vote a voter you nullify their voting power with your own voting power.  It is the moral equivalent of casting equal and opposite votes on every post without offending the posters.\n\nUnder such a system authors who vote for them selves and curators who vote robotically would be negated.  Only those who vote responsibly would remain.  Voting spam would be eliminated.\n\nWe have the potential to completely change the game by changing the question we ask.  Instead of asking whether the author did a bad job, we can ask ourselves whether the voters did a bad job.   \n\nVoters that vote poorly will kill the platform.  Voters who vote well will help the platform grow.  \n\n## Summary \n\nThere are many issues left to explore.  People will not like having their vote canceled any more than they like having their post down voted.  Curation rewards still favor those who use their power to vote over those who use their power to cancel other votes.  \n\nBottom line, a system of only up votes will not work. The game needs to be properly balanced or someone will be able to exploit the rules for undeserved profits.  \n\nMore to come in a future post.",

      "body": "<center>http://www.bitcoinisle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/02dealprof-master675.jpeg</center>\nTo continue with my discussion on voting I would like to review the incentive structure created by curation rewards.  This topic is highly controversial.  Everything I say in this post is just my personal opinion and does not represent the opinion of Steemit, Inc.  First lets review the game as it exists today.\n\n## Rewarding Voting \n\nVoting is something you can do almost as often as you like. Once you reach a certain level of Steem Power, almost every vote puts money in your pocket.  When I up vote something, I give the author $150 and I get to pocket $50.   That is a *huge* incentive for me to up vote everything I see.\n\nIt gets even more interesting if I up vote something that becomes extremely popular.  Suppose the post I up voted went on to earn $10,000, then my initial curation payout of $25 would grow to something like $1500.   The difference between a $25 payout and a $1500 payout is what motivates me to pick good content rather than bad content.  After all I have a limited number of high powered votes that I can cast.\n\nLets suppose that each week I pick 1000 posts to vote on within the first 30 minutes.  Assuming none of the posts get down votes I would pocket about $25,000.  For every post that goes on to earn $1000 or more, I can have 10 posts that get zeroed out.   Bottom line is that I could be pocketing $25,000 or more per week (paid out over 2 years) with an unsophisticated bot.\n\n## It Pays to be First\n\nSuppose that another whale of my stature were to vote just seconds before me.  My curation rewards would be dramatically reduced.  Instead of getting $1500 on a popular post, I would be lucky to get $200.  As a whale I lose significant money any time another whale beets me to a popular post.\n\nEven though it pays to vote before other whales, it certainly doesn\u2019t pay to vote too quickly.  If I voted on a popular article 15 minutes after it was posted and before any whales, then my reward might be $750 instead of $1500.  Every minute I wait to vote (up to 30 minutes) earns me $50, but if I wait too long some other whale will vote and I will lose money.\n\n## Whales are in Competition \n\nThe whales are in competition to up vote quality content first.  Each minute they must choose whether to vote on a post or wait.  Any whale who chooses not to play this game gets diluted by whales who do play (when Steem Power is more than 90% of supply).  \n\n## Strategy \n\nEach whale has to develop a strategy and the strategy will ultimately depend upon a statistical analysis of what posts tend to do well.  The simplest strategies include measuring the median time until a whale up votes a post by each author. This statistic will tell a whale who to vote on and when.\n\nIf all whales played by this strategy then certain authors would end up getting guaranteed votes as early as 10 minutes after they post. Smart whale bots would avoid voting after other whales and instead look for other content to up vote first.\n\nIn the hunt for better content whale bots can gather statistics on which minnows (or combinations of minnows) are the best early-predictors of popular content. Once these statistics are gathered the whale bot would vote on everything that shows that indicator. \n\n## Emergent Behavior \n\nIf we assume all whales are actively working on algorithms to ferret out the best content early, then quality authors will develop guaranteed patrons. Each whale has to make a decision on whether it is more profitable to be a patron to a particular author or to move on in search of another author.  \n\nThere is little financial incentive to \u201cpile on\u201d after other whales. Doing so will increase rewards to the author and to the other whales.  It makes little financial sense to dog-pile unless there is a very high probability that many more whales will follow. With each additional dog that piles on the incentives fall dramatically.  The first whale generally gets 80% of the curation rewards. \n\nThere is a complex incentive curve.  If I vote on 1000 things each day without much thought I can have an almost unchallengeable return on my steem power.  If I work slightly smarter I can increase my return.  The bigger a whale is, the larger this base rate of return becomes.\n\nThink of this as a mining war where whales are incentivized to implement advanced AI curators that are able to quickly identify gems that have not yet been identified by other whales.  Any whale that does not vote to the maximum extent possible is wasting potential income opportunities.  \n\n## Smoothing the Reward Curve \n\nAssuming more whale bots start operating then chances are that more people will get up voted by at least one whale.  Because everyone is sharing a single reward pool, this means the overall payout curve will get flatter.  \n\nAs the overall payout curve changes the expected value of an individual whales vote falls dramatically.  My up votes that are worth $250 when I vote a couple dozen times per day could fall to $100 if other whales started voting 1000 times per day.  \n\n## Curation Rewards Require Whales to use Bot Algorithms \n\nA so-called \u201cevil-whale\u201d is really nothing more than a curator \u201cminer\u201d making easy profits due to lack of competition.  If all whales were competing as actively as the \u201cevil whale\u201d then things would get far more challenging. Market competition would force the return earned by whales toward some kind of natural equilibrium.    \n\nVoting bots would become as prevalent as trading bots on the exchanges. Each whale would attempt to customize / tweak their bot to earn the greatest income by curating the most popular content.  Their bot will need to be unique and unpredictable or others will \u201cfront run\u201d them and take all of their rewards.\n\nNo whale that remains passive will be able to maintain the same stake in the system.  No selfish whale would ever want to use a down vote because it has a real cost to them and a socialized benefit to everyone else.\n\n## Role of Dolphins and Minnows \nBots need data, minnows generate data.  When bots are attempting to identify content to up vote they will take clues from minnows.  Good dolphins can even start to earn curation rewards when whale-bots pick up on their usefulness as an early indicator.  \n\n<center>http://mammajammaride.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ButterflyEffect3.jpg</center>\n\nIt may appear that minnows have no influence, but they become the butterfly in Africa that triggers a category 5 hurricane.  Minnows that consistently pick out winners *before they are winners* will eventually attract a multitude of whale and dolphin bots who follow their every vote.\n\nWhile a minnow vote may not appear to give authors much directly, they can have a massive impact indirectly.\n\n## Risk of Self Fulfilling Prophesy? \n\nMost existing robots (except cheetah) do not look at the content, but instead attempt to guess on what other robots and voters will do.  There is some risk that the game could evolve in such a way that content is ignored completely as bots up vote based upon what other bots do.\n\nI think this undesirable outcome is unlikely because a large number of normal users and altruistic whales will bias the final result based upon the quality of the content.  If the whale bots win the curation game but lose the quality content game, then all the Steem Power earned from curation will become worthless.  \n\nEveryone loses if quality content doesn\u2019t rise to the top.  This means that whale bots will develop a minimum quality threshold.   \n\nOver time there is financial incentive to write bots that parse content looking for signs of quality including:\n\n- images\n- outbound links to reputable domains \n- headers\n- length \n- reading level \n\nPeople will deploy \u201creverse spam filters\u201d that learn to identify quality content just like email spam filters learn to identify spam.  It won\u2019t take long for bots that look at content to become more profitable than bots that ignore it.\n\n## Monstro the Evil Whale \n<center>http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/e/e0/MOONSTRO.png</center>\nWhales earning curation rewards are not a problem if all whales participate in a healthy manner to curate.  The influence of any individual whale is minimized when dozens of whales and dolphins are actively competing for curation rewards.   \n\nAn evil whale is one who is actively looking to harm the platform.  They would start down voting quality content, burning the reputation of users, and up voting garbage content.  The *good* whales would have to act selflessly to counteract the behavior of an Evil whale. \n\nWhales that make money from legitimately voting as best they can (even using simplistic bots) are not any more evil than authors that take advantage of human nature to score votes.  \n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe existing curation rewards algorithm, once properly understood, will spawn an arms race to build better bots.  This means Steem will motivate the development of the decentralized autonomous curator.  It will spawn research into advanced artificial intelligence algorithms that are able to predict viral content early.  \n\nCuration is a game for whales and dolphins.  Minnows are unlikely to earn any significant return on their votes.  Minnows should stick to posting and commenting. \n\nPeople will buy Steem Power just for the opportunity to apply their own curation reward algorithm in an attempt to out-earn other Steem Power holders.  Algorithm development will advance like ASIC development.\n\nThat\u2019s the theory.  What do you think?",

Everyone is born with a sense of fairness, but somehow everyone doesn\u2019t agree with what is fair.\n\nThis feeling fairness has a built in bias that tends to favor our own perspective.  If we feel we are better off under a certain set of rules, then we are more likely to consider the rules fair.  It takes someone with great empathy to see fairness from another person's perspective.\n\nWhat is even more troubling for those who are rational is that \u201crational fairness\u201d can often be perceived as \u201cunfair\u201d by almost everyone. In fact, how we choose to perceive things can change what we think is fair.\n\n## What is fairness?\n\n> *adjective*: in accordance with the rules or standards; legitimate.\n\n> *adverb*: without cheating or trying to achieve unjust advantage.\n\nWhat we learn from these definitions of fairness is that it all depends upon some \u201crules\u201d or \u201cstandards\u201d.  If everyone can agree to the rules, then any outcome that adheres to the rules is inherently fair.\n\nAn sufficiently complex set of rules needs to be derived from principles.\n\n> **principle**: a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or for a chain of reasoning.\n\nIf we are to be rational about fairness, then all rules should derive from principles and should never be in contradiction with those principles.  A system that is in contradiction with its principles is not in line with the rules or standards and therefore illegitimate and unfair.\n\n## What principles guide voting?\n\nHere are some general principles that people may have:\n\n1. everyone get\u2019s a say\n2. everyone is equal \n3. majority rules\n4. secrecy\n\nWhen it comes to joint ownership of a company or currency, the principles are effectively the same except it is every-share instead of every-person.  \n\nA voting system is a means of measuring everyone\u2019s equal say for the purposes of making a decision that is binding on the group.  Whenever there are a group of individuals there are two or more different opinions on which way a decision can be made.\n\nUnfortunately the range of available opinions is infinite and more often than not contingent upon other people\u2019s opinions. This means that a perfectly expressive voting system would have everyone submit a smart contract that would take everyone else\u2019s opinion as input and generate an output.  A computer would then iterate as many times as necessary to compute a stable opinion.\n\nUnfortunately this process is not guaranteed to reach equilibrium and the *order of computation* can influence the outcome.  \n\n<center>https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mMJAPXw1hnY/VSmj62SUF2I/AAAAAAAADpU/SNegihhz4ls/w426-h276/15%2B-%2B1%2B%25287%2529.season.gif</center>\n\nIt is possible to express opinions that cancel out mathematically yet cannot be calculated iteratively. In the debate between rabbit season and duck season the result of that vote is \u201cunknown\u201d until someone else changes balance of power.\n\n## Perception of Fairness in Voting\n\nEveryone (or every share) is entitled to an opinion and deserves equal weight. When two people have opposite opinions (rabbit season vs not rabbit season) both opinions are legitimate.  How do we decide who wins?  Can a decision be made?   \n\nUnder this situation we have no outcome that can be rendered.  When exactly two people are voting and they disagree the result is \u201cno decision can be made\u201d.   In most cases this means status-quo remains unchanged. \n\nThe voting rules can be configured to bias the decision.  For example if \u201clast vote wins\u201d then the balance of power is shifted\u2026 who ever moves for change first loses.  If first vote wins then it becomes a race to vote.   Alternatively the system could be biased to say that in the event of a tie, \u201cduck season\u201d is chosen.\n\nIn other words, the rules of the game can favor certain outcomes over other outcomes.  This may be acceptable assuming everyone agrees the bias is \u201cfair\u201d, but I doubt Daffy would think defaulting to \u201cduck season\u201d is fair.\n\nA perfectly fair voting system would bias the outcome in favor of neither Daffy nor Bugs. \n\n## Perceived Unfairness is often a Rejection of Reality \n\nSuppose Daffy always disagrees with Bugs.  Bugs could claim this is \u201cunfair\u201d because it means that neither Daffy nor Bugs gets to decide.  It is always Bieber Season.  \n\nIs it legitimate for someone born without legs to claim that it is \u201cunfair\u201d that other people get to walk around?  Is it legitimate for someone born in Africa to claim it is \u201cunfair\u201d that someone else was born in USA?   If you were alone on an island, is it \u201cunfair\u201d that you have to do everything for yourself?   Fairness has nothing to do with it.\n\nOur much of our situation in life is beyond our control. If you happen to be born into a world with an evil twin who always does the opposite of you and opposes you at every stage is that unfair? To whom is it unfair, twin A or twin B?  Depending upon whose perspective you adopt the \u201cother guy\u201d is evil.   \n\nIn effect what someone claiming unfairness is saying is, \u201ctheir opinion is unfair, they are not entitled to that opinion\u201d.  They are upset because both of them are attempting to steer the car in equal and opposite directions and therefore the car continues straight.\n\n## Fairness is all in Our Head\n\nImagine you were the only living person in the world and everyone else was a robot that was pre-programmed with a certain set of behaviors.  Could you claim anything is unfair? That is just the way the world works. There are no \u201cpeople\u201d that are hurting you, the rules are created by nature and beyond the power of you or any of the robots to control.  \n\nIt is the attitude of entitlement that is the seed of unfairness.  The expectation that you *deserve* something that someone else has.  This attitude of entitlement is often rooted in envy, you *want* what the other person has and you feel they *don\u2019t deserve it*.  \n\nWhen it comes to negative voting the feeling of unfairness is identical to feeling it is unfair that you were born with an evil twin while everyone else wasn\u2019t.  \n\n## Principles Against Negative Voting\n\nIn an effort to look at things from both sides, I attempted to identify any principles of voting that may contradict with the concept of negative voting. What I came up with is the following:\n\n>  1. The only legitimate opinion is one that is derived independently of everyone else\u2019s opinion \n>  2. All votes should be secret\n\nThe theory behind this stance is that it takes work to create an opinion, but costs nothing to destroy an opinion. Furthermore, if all votes are secret then it becomes impossible to express a legitimate opinion that is exactly the opposite of someone else.\n\nI feel both of these principles are fundamentally flawed. For starters, every choice and idea we have in life is influenced by the opinion of others.  We are more likely to adopt someone else\u2019s opinion than develop one of our own.  Tribe mentality, catch phrases, and memes.   It is far easier to copy than to create.  In fact, more often than not people are not able to defend their own opinions from first principles, but instead appeal to authority.\n\nWe can conclude from this that affirmative voting would not be fully legitimate independently derived opinion, but the aggregation of other people\u2019s opinion filtered through personal bias.  In other words, it is just as biased and derivative as a negative vote.\n\nSecret voting prevents accountability.  Accountability is critical in game theory, especially in prisoners dilemma. If people down\u2019t know who is responsible for bad votes, then they don\u2019t know who to shun in the market.  Without recourse people will vote in anti-social manner.  In other words, the principle of the secret ballot is in direct contradiction with the principles of transparency and accountability.  \n\n## Conclusion \n\nI still believe that negative voting is a critical component of an anarchist society and is inherently fair.  I also believe that every other system is less expressive and ultimately less able to represent the will of the people (or shares).  \n\nThat said, perception often matters more than reality and we must design systems that are perceived to be fair even if they are logically and \u201cobjectively\u201d less fair from the perspective of mathematics, deductive reasoning, and first principles.   \n\nPerception is Reality.  Change your perception and you change your reality.",

This could hinder growth.   So we have our selfish desire to change the world and maintain our identity as a community fighting with another selfish desire to sell out to the masses to \"get rich\".  \n\nThe fallacy is to believe all opinions are equally valuable and that we should dilute our identity by awarding stake to those who oppose our principles. This is not censorship. This is a community with identity and values.  \n\nIf we allow those who promote statism to grow via our upvotes, then we are in effect allowing censorship to grow by supporting those people.  Censorship is something that only *governments* can do by interfering between the speaker and those who want to listen.\n\nSteem could be corrupted just like propaganda has corrupted the masses.  If that happens the voluntarists will have to start over with a new currency because the voters of Steem will implement a government that rejects property rights.",

      "body": "<center>https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1429327/blockchain-technology-bitcoin-contacts.jpg</center>\nSeveral months ago I discovered a [nifty little scripting language called WREN](https://github.com/munificent/wren) in my pursuit of high-performance deterministic scripting engines that could be leveraged for smart contracts.  \n\n## Wren is a small, fast, class-based scripting language\n\nHere are some of the highlights from their github repo.\n\n *  **Wren is small.** The VM implementation is under 4,000 semicolons.   You can skim the whole thing in an afternoon. It's *small*, but not  *dense*.\n *  **Wren is fast.** A fast single-pass compiler to tight bytecode, and a compact object representation help [Wren compete with other dynamic languages.](http://wren.io/performance.html)\n*  **Wren is class-based.** There are lots of scripting languages out there, but many have unusual or non-existent object models. Wren places classes front and center.\n *  **Wren is a scripting language.** Wren is intended for embedding in  applications. It has no dependencies, a small standard library,  and an easy-to-use C API. It compiles cleanly as C99, C++98  or anything later.\n\n## Requirements for Smart Contract Scripting Language \n\nA blockchain based smart contract scripting language has some very tough requirements:\n\n### Speed is Critical\nI have stated many times that the bottleneck for blockchain performance is the single threaded business logic of applications. Every blockchain transaction has the power to change the environment for the next transaction which makes out-of-order or parallel execution difficult.  \n\n### Deterministic Execution \nThe point of smart contracts is to come to an unambiguous consensus on the current state of the application. This requires all machines to arrive at the exact some conclusion.  Any deviations could result in an unexpected and undesirable blockchain fork.\n\n### Sandboxing \nCreating a blockchain that is ready and able to run arbitrary code requires that the code is heavily sandboxed. This means that it cannot enter infinite loops nor allocate an unbounded amount of memory.  Not only must execution time be monitored, but it must be deterministically calculated as part of global consensus.  In other words, it must count operations, not wall clock time and it must exit with an error at the exact same point on all machines.\n\n## Why WREN is Perfect for a Smart Contract Platform\n\n> Most of Wren\u2019s performance comes from language design decisions. While it\u2019s dynamically typed and dispatched, classes are relatively statically defined. That makes a lot of things much easier.  Wren\u2019s closest sibling, by far, is Lua. Lua is more dynamic than Wren which makes its job harder.\n\nYou can see some benchmarks of how fast WREN is compared to many other popular languages in this table.\n<center>https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/347290/17824100/ff639090-662d-11e6-9822-5f3ec9481ca6.png</center>\n\nIt gets this performance by combining the best aspects of scripting and statically typed languages.  This allows it to generate very efficient code.\n\n> Most of Wren\u2019s performance comes from language design decisions. While it\u2019s dynamically typed and dispatched, classes are relatively statically defined. That makes a lot of things much easier. Other languages have a much more mutable object model, and cannot change that without breaking lots of existing code.\n\nI recently [forked wren to add Sandbox support](https://github.com/bytemaster/wren) and submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/munificent/wren/pull/388). This was relatively trivial to implement because the code base was very clean and easy to understand.\n\n## Comparison to Ethereum and Lisk\n\nIn my opinion there is no comparison.  The performance of the Ethereum virtual machine is burdened by poor design decisions.  Many of Ethereum's poor decisions are a result of being built and designed by programmers with less language experience and more blockchain experience.  In other words, the EVM is designed by blockchain engineers thinking about blockchain problems and as a side effect they built a system that no language engineer would virtual machine designer would ever consider viable.\n\nI have built my own languages and compilers and can testify that designing high performance languages is a skill that most programmers do not have.\n\nWren has been designed by [Bob Nystrom](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/) author of the book [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/).   Game programming is very demanding and requires high performance scripting that is easily embedded within native C/C++ applications.   \n\nFrom what I can tell about Lisk and it's reliance on Javascript, it is not suitable for running untrusted code on a public blockchain in the same way Ethereum is.   Lisk is targeting a different market.  When I first heard of lisk I was excited because I thought they found a deterministic Javascript interpreter with sandboxing and computation metering; I was wrong.  \n\n## Future Work \n\nWren isn't perfect.  The language is still in its infancy, but if adopted by a blockchain community it could mature very quickly.  There is only one aspect of Wren that I would like to change and that is to convert it to use Integer math. Blockchain's do not require floating point operations.  Making this change should be relatively simple.\n\nOnce the Wren VM and compiler is mature, then it is simply a matter of integrating the VM with some C++ APIs for reading and writing blockchain state and generating blockchain operations.  This kind of feature is probably best to keep in a sidechain / subchain until all the kinks are worked out.",

      "body": "<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Black_Swan_bg.jpg/2880px-Black_Swan_bg.jpg\nBlack swan on Vacha reservoir, Bulgaria  by [Kiril Krastev](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Littlegrizmin)</center>\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, our team has been working through the Steem Dollar mechanics in an effort to secure the economic foundation of Steem against black swan events.  It should be obvious to all that if at any point in the future the market cap of Steem fell below the supply of Steem Dollars then the Steem Dollar would break.   Long before that happened there would be a *run on the bank*.  \n\nWe designed the Steem incentives to always push Steem toward a Steem Dollar supply equal to about 5% of the available market cap.  This happens because for every Steem Dollar we create we create about 19 Steem Dollar\u2019s worth of Steem and Steem Power.  \n\nThis system works well when the market cap is rising or relatively stable, but there is one edge case which could cause the system to unravel.  When the market cap falls and pushes the Steem Dollar ratio to dangerously high levels (20% or more of market cap), then the network must start paying off its \u201cdebt\u201d with \u201cequity\u201d and reducing the Steem Dollar supply.  \n\n## Extremely Unlikely but not Impossible\n\nBefore anyone starts worrying, lets look at what would have to happen before these kind of scenarios become a concern.   \n\nCurrently **Steem Dollars represent about 1% of market cap** and total about $2.1 million dollars.  This is a very safe level.   The market cap would have to fall to $10.5 million dollars before Steem Dollars represents 20% or more of the market cap.    \n\nEach day the supply of Steem Dollars is increasing so over time the danger zone market cap will rise.  \n\n## Reducing Steem Dollar Supply in Down Market\n\nThere is only one way to reduce the Steem Dollar supply and that is by users voluntarily converting their Steem Dollars to STEEM at the price feed via the 7 day conversion. This processes can be incentivized by offering a short-term premium conversion rate that gives each Steem Dollar holder $1.25 worth of STEEM when they convert.   This is possible by having the witnesses temporarily adjust the price feed. \n\nIt would be critical that the premium remain temporary and has a pre-planned deadline or else the market would permanently adjust the trading value of Steem Dollars to reflect this new premium conversion rate.  \n\nSteem Whales can also buy Steem Dollars on the market by powering down some STEEM and then convert to back to STEEM.  This process would not necessarily be profitable for whales and suffers tragedy of the commons.  One whale would carry the burden for the benefit of the entire platform.\n\n## Stop Increasing the Supply\n\nOf course it gets difficult to reduce the Steem Dollar supply when the supply keeps growing due to interest and author rewards.  The fastest way to dig yourself out of a hole is to stop digging.  As it exists today, this isn\u2019t an option for author rewards but it is possible to reduce the interest rate to 0%. \n\n## New Enhancements for Stability \n\nIn the up coming hard fork we will be including changes to the protocol designed to protect all parties in the event persistent price declines and lack of redemption requests allow the Steem Dollar supply to reach unhealthy and unsustainable levels. \n\n### Gradual Shift in Author Rewards \n\nAs the Steem Dollar supply grows from 3% to 5% the percent of author rewards paid in Steem Dollars will go from 50% to 0% and the percent paid as liquid STEEM will go from 0% to 50%.  In this way authors are still awarded with liquid assets, but the network gradually slows down the printing presses on Steem Dollars. \n\nAt current levels, this measure wouldn\u2019t take effect unless the market cap fell to $70M and would completely stop issuing new Steem Dollars when the market cap fell to about $40M.  \n\n### Gradual Forced Redemption of Steem Dollars for STEEM\n\nAny time the Steem Dollar supply reaches 20% of the market cap, 1% of everyone\u2019s Steem Dollars will be converted to Steem Power at the price feed.  This action can be viewed as a partial \u201cbail-in\u201d where everyone is treated equally.  This will immediately reduce the Steem Dollar percent of total market cap while preventing immediate dumping of the STEEM which could accelerate the collapse in a positive feedback loop.\n\nSteem Dollar holders that wish to avoid this forced redemption should convert to STEEM and sell on the market.  If done via the 7 day conversion process, then the supply should decrease naturally and all Steem Dollar holders can be spared the \u201cbail in\u201d.  \n\n## Implications \n\nIt is our belief that having this safety net in place before it becomes an issue will help the entire community know how stake will be allocated in the event of persistent long term declines in price.  The existence of this safety net will in turn reduce the likelihood that fear will turn into panic selling that would ultimately precipitate such an event.\n\nIt should be obvious to all that Steem Dollars are not backed by any individual holding dollars in a bank or promising to pay US dollars and that the only thing you are guaranteed is some amount of STEEM.  The STEEM cannot be guaranteed to have purchasing power.  \n\nUnder the enhanced rules everyone is protected and fairly dealt with in the unfortunate event that the market cap of the platform is unable to sustain the Steem Dollar debt levels.\n\n## Feedback Wanted\nIf anyone has any concerns or has better solutions in mind please let us know.",

      "body": "<center>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Onedolar2009series.jpg</center>\nSafety, security, stability, and sustainability are very important design characteristics that our team is always attempting to maximize.  We must balance many variables when creating cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and economic incentives.  In particular it is important to design systems that remain robust and predictable in *all* market conditions.\n\n## Steem Dollars have Limits \n\nThe idea behind a Steem Dollar is that it should ***almost always*** be worth about one US dollar. We have set rules in place to make this statement true 99% of the time by making the Steem Dollar convertible to a dollar worth of STEEM.  \n\nAnyone who promises you that any asset will **always** be worth something is either ignorant to some risks or a liar.  This is true for bank deposits, gold coins, and crypto currencies.  Banks can seize your funds, go bankrupt, have a bail in, or hyper inflate the currency until it is worthless.  In other words you are never guaranteed purchasing power.\n\nWhen it comes to the Steem Dollar, their purchasing power depends upon the market demand for STEEM.  The Steem Dollar is really nothing more than a smart contract for a variable amount of STEEM depending upon an oracle. If STEEM is worthless than the Steem Dollar will also be worthless.\n\nAs the value of STEEM falls, the amount of STEEM required to represent a U.S. dollar worth of value approaches infinity.  If left unchecked, the Steem Dollar could render STEEM worthless and when that happens all Steem Dollars become worthless too.  \n\n## Black Swan Events need a Plan \n\nIt isn\u2019t possible to prevent all black swan events, but it is possible to establish a fair set of rules for handling them.  It is always best to define the rules before they are necessary so that everyone can take full responsibility for the consequences of their trading decisions.  \n\nThere are two major black swan events that the Steem community and traders should have a contingency plan in place for. The first black swan is if the value of STEEM crashes so far that Steem Dollars represent an insurmountable burden on the STEEM price that sets off a chain reaction pushing the value of STEEM toward zero. \n\nThe second major black swan event is when the US dollar hyperinflates and becomes worthless as a day to day currency.  In my opinion this is the more likely outcome.\n\n## Price Feed defines Value of Steem Dollar\n\nThe price feed can be viewed as a mathematical function that traders and speculators can trade against for determining the value of the Steem Dollar at any time.   Right now we have defined the function to always equal the **approximate marginal price 1 STEEM fetches on the open market**.  \n\nThere are two extreme cases, black swans, that must be considered.  In one extreme the price goes to 0, in the other extreme the price goes to infinity.  It is in the interest of everyone involved that the value of a Steem Dollar never hits either extreme.  This can be implemented in objective terms by setting hard limits on the exchange rate range that is allowed.\n\nWe can set a maximum and minimum Steem Dollar price as follows:\n\n**maximum price** =  SteemSupply / (10 * SteemDollarSupply)\n**minimum price**  =  SteemSupply / (10000 * SteemDollarSupply)\n\nWith these rules in place, Steem Dollar holders are protected against US dollar hyperinflation and Steem holders are protected against US dollar \u201chyperdeflation\u201d.  The witnesses are trusted to publish a honest price feed relative to dollars at all times, but the blockchain will enforce these hard limits.\n\nIn other words, the market cap of all Steem Dollars will always be between 0.01% and 10% of the Steem market cap. This will become a mathematical reality with the addition of two lines of code to the method that calculates the conversion price.  \n\n## Sustainable and Fair\n\nThese rules would make the economic system of Steem sustainable and fair in all circumstances by clarifying the meaning of a Steem Dollar.  With the clarified meaning, a Steem Dollar is allowed to have values above or below a U.S. dollar under certain market conditions.  All traders can be aware of those conditions and trade accordingly.   \n\nBy implementing these rules long before the STEEM / USD price gets near either extreme all market participants have ample opportunity to adjust their positions.  \n\n## No Promise of Value \n\nSteemit, Inc cannot and will not promise that the STEEM token, Steem Power, or Steem Dollars will have any value now or in the future.  We aim only to create fair rules to approximate the relative subjective value each member of the Steem community brings to the table.  Any value these tokens have will at all times be set by the free market through voluntary exchange.  \n\n\n## Benefits over Alternative Approaches\n\nIn a prior post I outlined a solution that would covert 1% of Steem Dollars to Steem Power as a means of correcting the imbalance.  This solution had the nice property of only exposing 1% of a person\u2019s steem dollars to volatility at a time, but had the down side of making the life of exchanges and smart contracts everywhere very complex.   Every smart contract would have to factor in the potential that a liquid asset like Steem Dollars could be partially converted to an illiquid asset such as VESTS.   This great complicates things such as *escrow transactions* and *side chains* and exchange deposits.   In other words, it had all of the negative properties on 3rd parties that could be associated with negative interest rates.\n\nSome people suggested things like bootstrapping an economy around Steem Dollars or buying them back with Ad revenue.  It isn't a matter of finding buyers for Steem Dollars, it is a matter of maintaining a debt ceiling.  Simply moving Steem Dollars from person to person does not solve the problem.  \n\n## Thanks for Feedback \n\nWe would like to thank everyone for the feedback they have provided and invite additional feedback.  We are all in this together, lets make Steem the best platform for everyone involved.",

      "body": "<center>https://s3.postimg.io/bzlvi7qlf/trend.png</center>\n\nAt first glance this chart looks *really bad*, users continue to sign up but activity has fallen or remained flat.  The activity per user was hit significantly from both sides.\n\nUp until a couple of days ago we had a significant number of fake account signups.  We were able to slow, but not eliminate, this signup abuse by adding Google's reCAPTCHA.  You can visibly see the reduction in the rate of signup the past several days.\n\n<center>https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/images/hero-recaptcha-demo.gif</center>  \n\n## User Account Spam \n\nIn addition to accounts being created by abusing our signup offer, many people have been creating and mining accounts.  Name squatting due to [STEEM DNS](https://steemit.com/steemit/@someguy123/steem-dns-your-username-dot-steem-dns-on-the-blockchain) has also caused many accounts to be created for this purpose.\n\n## Voting and Posting Spam \n\nOver the past month we have been systematically deploying solutions that mitigate spam.  We have imposed stronger bandwidth limits, minimal voting thresholds, and reputation systems.  The result of this anti-spam measure is a net reduction in votes, posts, and replies.  \n\n## Conclusion \n\nIt is tempting to look at these charts and deceive ourselves into believing there are 80K *real* accounts or that all the voting, posting, and replying activity in July was *real*.  Believing these things reinforces our own biases and desire to see Steem grow overnight.  \n\nThe problem is, if we let ourselves believe that lie, then we must also believe that Steem is losing traction / retention.  All of a sudden our \"harmless\" self-deception has us in panic mode as it appears something has come unhinged.\n\nThe more realistic way of viewing things is to greatly discount the number of accounts by removing duplicate miners, name squatters, and anyone inactive.  This will give us daily active users which is around 1200 and weekly active users which is around 8000.  Then filter all of the spam / automated activity from the month to get a better signal of organic use by real people.  \n\nAfter doing these things you will see that Steem is in fact growing, quality is improving, and  the sun is shining on all things Steem.\n\n<center>http://blog.hdwallsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sunrise-cloud-wallpaper-21883-22436-hd-wallpapers.jpg</center>",

Should we give up comforts today in pursuit of an illusive utopia that we hope to bring about?  These are the questions that need to be answered and understood at a deep level if we actually want to change the world. Will changing the world actually make our life better? Wouldn\u2019t it simply be easier to just make as much money as we can, have as much fun as possible, and take the easiest road?  Why bother with anything that could bring unnecessary pain and suffering with little probability of reward?\n\n## My Mission in Life \n\nI have long held that my mission is to find free market solutions for securing life, liberty, and property.  This mission is deeply rooted in the belief that initiation of violence is not necessary to live in a well ordered society and that everyone\u2019s life would be better off if it could be achieved. This is a belief I choose because there is insufficient evidence to prove violence is necessary.  \n\nMany detractors claim non-violence solutions are not possible, but their arguments ultimately fail due to [a fallacy known as argument from ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance).   In effect, they claim that because there is no known non-violent solutions (that they believe will work) that it is impossible.  They decide to stop looking and/or working toward non-violent solutions. In other words, they choose to believe violence is necessary.  In both cases, an individual\u2019s belief shapes their reality and in both cases it is an article of faith.   \n\nMy mission is a dangerous mission. If I am successful I will make enemies in the highest places of violent power. My very life is at risk the moment I discover any solution that is perceived as a real threat.\n\nChanging the world is a mission that is bigger than any one person. It requires building a new social structure that binds all of society together in a non-violent way.  It requires persuading a sufficiently large minority to organize an effective non-violent resistance to government violence.  In short, it requires convincing people to take on some of the same risks I face. \n\nIf I am to be successful in convincing others to take these risks, then I must face my own demons and conquer my own fears.  I must find and articulate an argument that is powerful enough to bring millions of people into a movement.  I would be dishonest if I said I don\u2019t struggle with these things.  It is because of my own internal struggles that I sat down to organize my thoughts in this article.\n\n## Privatized Costs and Socialized Benefits \n\nThe core problem with absolutely every resistance movement is a tragedy of the commons.  We all want to be free to live our lives in peace and no one wants to face jail time or death by government. The costs to the individual are immediate and potentially infinite, but the benefits they receive, if any, accrue to the masses of ungrateful strangers way in the future, if ever.  \n\nThis economic reality means that most resistance movements do not gather supporters until the supporters have *nothing left to lose*.  In other words, until the cost of participation falls below the perceived benefit (almost 0).   At some point people are willing to die and at this point they are willing to take extreme risks with low probability of payout. \n\nThe economic and political enslavement of mankind will continue until Atlas is unable to carry the world on his shoulders and the whole world suffers an economic collapse.  It is from the depth of this collapse that people have nothing left to lose and real change is possible.  \n\n<center>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0a/41/a4/0a41a43f5243ce2fdb7b643679bdeda7.jpg <br/>\nThe Bank of Evil - Despicable Me</center>\n\n## Do we accept reality or resist it?  \n\nThose who practice meditation or follow Eckhart Tolle know that all suffering is something we put ourselves through by resisting the world as it is now, this very moment.\n\n> \u201cSuffering begins when you mentally label a situation as bad. That causes an emotional contraction. When you let it be, without naming it, enormous power is available to you. The contraction cuts you off from that power, the power of life itself.\u201d  ~ Eckhart Tolle\n\nFrom this perspective paying taxes, complying with regulations, and otherwise accepting our status as slaves makes the most sense.  There is no point in getting *angry* or *frustrated* at the status quo.  Our anger and frustration will only serve to further lower our enjoyment of life and have no impact at all on the quality of life of our slave masters.  \n\n> \u201cIf you are in the habit of creating suffering for yourself, you are probably creating suffering for others too.\u201d ~ Eckhart Tolle \n\nWhen we approach life with a resistance to what is we are tempted to respond out of anger, frustration, and hate.  Our actions in turn result in the suffering of others.  Their suffering in turn causes more anger, frustration, and the circle of violence continues. The powers that be divide us by causing conflicts and manipulating our emotional responses.\n\nWhy should we label violence as bad and non-violence as good?  Aren\u2019t these very labels the source of our suffering?  And if we remove these labels, what meaning is there in creating a non-violent society?  Why should we suffer to bring it about?\n\n## Non-violence isn\u2019t a Technique it is a result of Accepting Reality\n\nWhat is the purpose of violence?  Why do we use it?  Violence is a response (resistance) to what is.  It is a rejection of reality.  Violence is the result of an inability to see the aliveness in others; an inability to feel connected with all of life.   \n\n> Prejudice of any kind implies that you are identified with the thinking mind. It means you don't see the other human being anymore, but only your own concept of that human being. To reduce the aliveness of another human being to a concept is already a form of violence.\n\nSo without labeling violence as good or bad, we can see that its root cause is in lack of awareness.  One cannot be connected with all of life and simultaneously advocate violence and destruction. If you have no internal resistance, then what basis is there for violence?  Is initiation of violence not sufficient evidence of our own disconnect from our true nature, our own fear, and   our own defense of ego?  \n\nIn what situation can someone simultaneously claim they are at peace in the present moment and feel that initiating violence is *necessary*?  What motive is there for violence that is not rooted in an attachment to outcomes?  How much more do we suffer from our resistance and attachment than we do from whatever it is we think violence will solve?   \n\n## When you find true freedom, you have nothing left to lose.  \n\nOnce you master *living in the moment* then all of your self-inflicted emotional suffering ends. There is no more anger and no more attachment to things or outcomes. With this you also free yourself from manipulation by the powers that be.\n\n> \u201cTrue freedom is living as if you had completely chosen whatever you feel or experience in this moment. This inner alignment with the Now is the end of suffering.\u201d  ~ Eckhart Tolle\n\nThis state of being creates a paradox for those with aims to change the world. If you are at complete peace with the way things are, then what motive is there to change the world?  On what basis should you choose to act?  This is the very heart of economics, the study of human action.  This is the root of my current internal conflict.  \n\n## Is Economic Thinking a Fallacy for Awakened Individuals?\n\nIf we view man as a purely economic creature we assume all actions are in someway tied to profit seeking activities. We assume that profit is the motive force. It might be fair to say that most of economics is based upon the assumption of an unenlightened individual stuck in a capitalist rat race.  \n\nAll of economic calculation boils down to risk / reward or profit and loss.  It is our desire for profit and our fear of loss that drive us to make the best decisions we can.  An enlightened individual has no fear of loss nor need for more.  Their actions are therefore much harder to predict and most economic models cannot fully account for them.\n\n> In awakened doing there is complete internal alignment with the present moment and whatever you are doing right now. The doing is then not primarily a means to an end, but an opening for consciousness to come into this world.\n\n## Basis for Acting \n\nIf we are not motivated by desire for profits or fear of loss, then how should we decide what actions to take each moment?  Eckhart suggests that everything should be done from acceptance (fixing a flat tire in the rain), enjoyment, or enthusiasm (creating something).\n\n> You have a goal. You know where you are going. The goal has its importance. But the doing is what is truly fulfilling. Every enthusiastic person has a goal that may be important, but the doing is intensely fulfilling, and it is the essence of enthusiasm. ~ Eckhart Tolle\n\n## The Means is Everything - The End doesn\u2019t Matter \n\nAll of a sudden we learn something profound.  If our goal is a non-violent voluntarist society, then there is no point in using violence *now*.   This moment is all there is and in this moment we can choose to use violence or not use violence.  If your aim is to bring non-violence into the world, then it must be done by non violent means.  \n\n## What I learned writing this Article\n\nWhen I sat down to write this article I didn\u2019t know what my conclusion would be.  I just knew there was an internal, and unresolved conflict within.  Now that I am 1700 words into it, I have rediscovered and reconnected with the motivation behind my mission.  \n\nEach day I act to bring about a non-violent solutions to world governance because I enjoy the creative problem solving process.  I do not act out of resistance to the existing government, but in full acceptance of it. I do not act in fear of the existing government, but with rational self preservation as part of the creation process.   \n\nThe accumulation of wealth, power, influence are tools, but I must not allow my identity to get caught up in it.  The trappings of this world are just that, traps.  The moment we are afraid to lose our trappings we become trapped in our own delusional ego.\n\nI have learned that each action I take is more powerful if done in the moment, without resistance, and with full acceptance. I have also learned that for my vision to become a reality, I will need to help awaken others to the present moment.  \n\nAny economic system of voluntary rules and incentives I create will struggle to gain traction unless it is used and operated by enlightened individuals.  Steem can be an incredibly powerful tool in the hands of aware individuals living in the moment, but it will utterly fail if it is overcome by unaware individuals trapped in their own ego.   \n\nJealously, greed, envy, malice, spitefulness, and vengeance will destroy any community. Enlightened individuals living in the moment without any resistance to what *is* right now experience none of these things.  I will keep this in mind as we work to build and grow Steem.",

      "body": "<center>https://i.imgflip.com/p1ij6.jpg<br/>**CENSORSHIP**</center>\n\nLanguage is a very powerful tool because it shapes the way we think. The words we choose to use [impact how we think, feel, and reason about the world around us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity). Today I would like to address the word *censorship* because it is a very hot topic on steemit.\n\nThe first problem we always face is different and ambiguous definitions for censorship.  Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t always practical to *define* our terms in every debate and therefore drama queens toss the term \u201ccensorship\u201d around far too easily. I would go so far as to say that the censorship card is played about as often and illegitimately as the race card.  Often those who play the *race card* are more *racist and oppressive* than those they slander, the same principle applies to those who play the censorship card.\n\n## Censorship requires Aggression \n\nThe defining characteristic of a free society is the absence of initiation of violence. This includes the credible threat of violence, fraud, theft, etc.   Without the threat of aggression people can freely say whatever they want, whenever they want without fear that their person or property will be harmed. A critical distinction of a free society is that you cannot express yourself in ways that violate the property rights of others.\n\n## Graffiti is Aggression and violation of Property Rights\n \nGraffiti is defined as writing or drawings scribbled, scratched, or **sprayed illicitly on a wall or other surface in a public place**. In a free society the Graffiti artist would be tracked down and expected to pay restitution to the property owner.  No rational individual would argue that the artist has been censored by the property owner or that the property owner is the one initiating aggression against the artist.\n\n## Property Owner defines Art vs Graffiti \nThere are places where graffiti-style art is acceptable and is actually encouraged. In this case no aggression has occurred and therefore the action is legitimate. \n\n<center> https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7485/15754046208_7d666a75a9_o.jpg</center>\n\n## Spam, Porn, Harassment, and Fraudulent posts are Digital Graffiti  \n\nWhen it comes to websites like Facebook, YouTube, Google, Reddit, and Steemit we have digital property owned by individuals providing a free and voluntary service to society. It is not possible for these organizations to censor user content because they are not using violence, theft, etc. \n\nThe only true censorship is when government agents approach these companies and demand content be removed under threat of force or violence.  Provided these companies are not under any kind of threat, there can be no censorship.\n\nWhen someone [demands that YouTube share ad revenue](/steemit/@calaber24p/censorship-on-youtube-creates-an-unique-opportunity-for-decentralized-platforms-like-steemit-to-create-an-alternative-video) they are taking the role of the Graffiti artist that demands property owners not repaint over their artwork.\n\nSome people may consider the [Graffiti artwork worth thousands of dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy), but this doesn\u2019t change the moral character of the vandalism.  Likewise, some people may feel their humor, sarcasm, teasing, crude language, or vulgar posts to be artwork and demand that other users see it and/or up vote it for payment. \n\n## Graffiti Hurts Community Value \n\nWe all love the idea that Free Speech adds value to the speaker, but our selfish desires to be heard come at the expense of the listeners.  Few people desire to move into a neighborhood where there is unfettered graffiti and complete disrespect for property rights.  Likewise, few people want to join an online community where there are no standards of mutual respect.\n\n## A Perception Problem \n\nWe have a very real problem in society today.  The problem is that people feel *entitled* to things that are not theirs.  Whether it is health care, google ranking, reputation, or [right for gay couples to be served by particular vendors who oppose gay marriage](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jul/08/tony-perkins/wedding-vendors-have-been-forced-participate-same-/).  These entitlements can only be delivered by initiating force and violence against innocent people.\n\nIf a particular vendor (YouTube, Facebook, Google, or your Local Florist) will not serve you, then you must take your business elsewhere.  Vendors who lose a significant amount of business will voluntarily reconsider their policies.   \n\n## But they have a monopoly!  \n\nTo the extent that a business gains the vast majority of the market share without relying on government regulations to shield them from competition, the monopoly is deserved and was earned by providing a quality product that others were unable to compete with.\n\nThere are no laws forcing everyone to use Google, YouTube, Reddit, or Facebook. There are no regulations preventing competitors from starting up and competing.  Complaining about their unwillingness to serve you is like a local mall refusing to allow certain tenants.  It will certainly make business more challenging for those tenants, but the prospective tenants are not entitled to a prime high-traffic spot in the mall.\n\n## Flagging Posts based upon Differing Opinions \n\nSome people have been complaining about users who down-vote posts they disagree with. The basis of the idea is that all posts are *entitled to* funding from those who support the ideas.  This stance is in direct opposition to the vested interests of every stakeholder.  \n\n\n<center>http://godfatherpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/thomas-jefferson.png</center>  \n\nWhat should happen when one stakeholder wishes to fund a cause abhorrent to another stakeholder of equal size?  The two opinions are canceled out and the remaining stakeholders get to decide.\n\n## Incentive to be Tolerant and Inclusive \n\nAll users, particularly whales, have financial incentive to be tolerant and inclusive.  This grows the overall network effect and makes everyone the most money possible.  To the extent any community adopts a culture of intolerance that overly restricts the range of acceptable opinion it will push people away.  New communities will form to serve the needs of those who are rejected and the free market competition for mindshare will continue.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf Steem remains a libertarian / anarchist enclave then it will fail to attract a broader audience and that in turn will mean that ordinary people will not get involved with cryptocurrency.  Likewise, if Steemit fails to curtail abusive, threatening, and toxic individuals it will also drive away the broader audience leaving only those with skin thick enough to take the abuse of trolls.  \n\nI want Steem be a healthy, vibrant community with engaging discussions from people with all points of view. Unfortunately (and fortunately?), I am only one of many users who have a say in what kind of content gets voted on.  Each and every one of us contributes to the culture and we will all succeed or fail based upon how we act.\n\nLets stop throwing the term \u201ccensorship\u201d around here on Steemit unless it is explicitly referring to the threat of violence.  It is out of place and conjures up inappropriate negative reactions similar to playing the race card.  Instead, lets focus on the rights of all voters to express their opinion for or against any post.  If you disagree with how someone is voting, then focus your argument on how something adds or removes value to the community rather than whether someone is committing the \u201cvile\u201d sin of non-censorship by utilizing their legitimate voting rights.\n\nSteemit is a free and voluntary platform built on the basis of free association; censorship is impossible in such an environment even if the community or steemit.com chooses to minimize the visibility of some content or block it all together.  \n\nThe blockchain is open, your content is logged and recorded for all time.  Anyone who wants to see your content or offer a competing service to steemit.com is free to curate and display what they like.  \n\n## P.S. On Definitions \n\nWe live in a world where common words are generally used in ways that are in direct contradiction of their meaning.  The unfortunate reality dramatically lowers the quality of public discourse because it allows people to talk past each other.  Activists leverage the emotional response to the word censorship to provoke people into violating the property rights of others.  It may well be that censorship is taking on a broader meaning that would also encompass the no coerced behavior of Google, Facebook, etc.   The problem with the broader meaning is that the word censorship is no longer useful for accurately defining moral/immoral behavior.  Under the broader definition, accusing someone of censorship is as meaningless as accusing them of filtering spam emails.  How dare they censor spam artists!",

My definition of a free society is one that is not governed by initiation of violence and where all relationships and business transactions are voluntary. This means self-censorship and discrimination of all kinds are the very foundation of a functioning free society. \n\nI know this *sounds* controversial to those who are deathly afraid of racism, bigotry, and general social pressure. Please suspend your judgement until you finish reading this article. I am not racist and will gladly do business with anyone of any race who offers a profitable opportunity. \n\n## Free Market Solutions to Securing Life, Liberty, and Property \n\nIf you follow my blog you will know that I am constantly searching for non-violent alternatives to government.  The anarchists among us know how challenging this can be.  Most simply accept on faith that \u201cthe market will provide\u201d, but few pursue the question of \u201chow will the market provide?\u201d.  Those that do pursue the question of how the market will provide often do so on a purely theoretical basis.  \n\nWhat makes me different from the vast majority of armchair anarchists and voluntarists is that I am actively engaged in an entrepreneurial business of bringing viable solutions to the market. Theoretical market structures in a post-government world are of no use to someone attempting to bootstrap a business securing life, liberty, and property in a totalitarian state.\n\nThe only non-violent society that will have staying power is the one that can be born under oppression and through its own strength overthrow that oppression while adhering to its own principles.  \n\n## Self Censorship *is* Self Government \nEach individual is responsible for not acting in ways that would violate the non aggression principle.  This means that they must censor their desire for revenge.  They must hold their punches.  They must honor their contracts and avoid fraud, slander, libel, and offensive conduct.\n\n<center>http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/keep-calm-and-be-grateful-i-self-censor.png</center>\n\nNot only must someone watch what they do, they must watch what they say.  **This is because you do not own your reputation!**  Contrary to popular belief, you have no right to control what other people *think* about you.  Your actions are a major contributor to your reputation, but ultimately how your actions are *interpreted* by others is what defines their opinion of you. Their opinion of you then defines their willingness to do business with you. Furthermore, *perception* matters more than reality because people make their decisions on their *perception* which may have nothing to do with *reality*.\n\n\n## What if Society is Wrong?\n\nSuppose the vast majority of society is against public nudity? Under such a society business owners would discriminate against naked customers.  They would do this even if they had nothing against nudity simply because they could lose the business of their other customers.\n\nThose who wanted to enjoy naked living would need to go to businesses that specialize in serving naked customers.  \n\nIf nudity was sufficiently taboo, then businesses may ultimately disassociate themselves from anyone known to serve nude customers.  This could ultimately make operating a business serving naked customers completely unviable if the business owner wished to maintain the benefits of having a good reputation with the rest of society.\n\nSuppose your moral code sees nothing wrong with naked living.  Suppose you wish to enjoy life living in a nudist colony?  This society would completely shun you. It would ruin your opportunity to find jobs, make friends, and ultimately you would be forced to *conform* with the prevailing opinion.  You would be forced to censor your own body anytime you were in the presence of anyone else.  \n\nWhat happened to your freedom?  Is your naked body harming others?  They seem to think so and ultimately public opinion is the judge of what constitutes \u201caggression\u201d and therefore what behaviors should be shunned.  \n\nIf the majority of society has a different opinion on what is \u201cright\u201d and what is \u201cwrong\u201d, then all you can do is keep your behavior out of public spotlight or engage in a discussion and attempt to persuade others to change their opinion.  \n\n## Centralized Reputation \n\nAs a society grows larger than a couple hundred people, it becomes impossible for any one individual to have first hand information from which to derive an independent opinion about another individual.  Instead people must delegate the process of reputation to others. This is the *birth* of government.\n\nMost people let the government define an individual\u2019s reputation. If the government says someone is \u201cbad\u201d, then they also adopt the same opinion.  Laws and courts are nothing more than the process of defining who has a \u201cgood reputation\u201d and who has a \u201cbad reputation\u201d.  \n\nOnce you have a \u201cbad reputation\u201d few people are willing to risk their own \u201creputation\u201d defending you.  Governments enforce coordinated shunning of those they deem to be bad through the use of prisons.  They physically cut off an individuals freedom to do business with others. \n\nThe legitimacy of the entire process depends upon the reputation of the system itself.  Control over the reputation system of society is absolute power.\n\n## Decentralized Reputation \n\nThe key to decentralizing power is to decentralize control over reputation. This is achieved in a free market through *voluntary* coordinated shunning. Each business owner gets to influence public policy by setting the price of doing business with them.  A business owner who is against nudity can set the price of eating in his establishment as a combination of money *and* behavior (wearing clothes).\n\nThose who wish to partake in the products offered by the market must be willing to pay the price. This means they must conform in order to *earn* the products and services they wish to receive from others.\n\nThe more of society that agrees on certain behavior norms, the more costly it becomes to violate those norms.  The most universally demanded behaviors will be against violence, theft, and fraud.  The price for violating these norms will be to pay full restitution or be completely outcast from society.  A complete outcast becomes a beggar or slave to whomever will care for them and could potentially face death if they are unable to be completely self reliant.\n\nThe more controversial an issue becomes lower the price of not conforming.\n\n## Paradox for Anarchists \n\nAn anarchist is advocating a society that allows free expression without fear of others initiating violence in a systematic way.  The only way to achieve such a society is to change public opinion.  We all live and die by public opinion.\n\nIt is public opinion that currently enslaves us under governments and under an anarchy that same public opinion will continue to be the source of all power enforcing the non aggression principle.  \n\nThis means that without using violence or taxation, a free society could conceivable compel everyone to purchase health insurance. It could conceivably compel a prohibition of drugs and alcohol.  It could conceivably self-censor any topic and demand adherence to all kinds of behavior we currently find abhorrent about governments.  All of this would be compelled through market forces; it would simply be too expensive to resist. \n\nWhat anarchists know is that it is incredibly difficult to get people to agree on anything. Anything that was sufficiently controversial would be permitted because it requires a near universal acceptance of an opinion before coordinated shunning is effective.  Most people are neutral toward anything that doesn\u2019t impact themselves. In fact, most people are willing to \u201clook the other way\u201d if it will make them a buck. \n\nThe difference between a government and a free society is that all social laws must be incredibly simple and general because you would never get any consensus behind anything overly specific.  It is the overly specific laws that allow individuals in power to abuse the masses and prevent individuals from making more decentralized judgments.  \n\n## Conclusion \n\nThose who complain about censorship motivated by social pressure are simultaneously guilty of applying that kind of censorship through their support of the government required to prevent it. We all wish we could live in a world where everyone shared our opinion and we could do what ever we want, when ever we want, wherever we want.  That world is logically impossible.  We will always be bound by public opinion.  The best we can hope for is to sway that opinion away from accepting initiating violence as necessary toward complete shunning of anyone who initiates violence.  \n\nI would go so far to say, that a non-violent society would completely self-censor any suggestion of violence.  There very suggestion that violence be initiated against someone is a threat to such a society.  Such an individual could not be trusted.\n\nOnce you realize that an anarchist society would self-censor competing ideas, it becomes very clear why a statist society must censor anarchist ideas.  A statist society would use violence to enforce their censorship, a voluntarist society would use peer pressure and self-censorship.\n\nCensorship is a shield used to protect the prevailing opinion against anything that would change it. Whether it is used for \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d depends entirely upon the idea being defended.",

      "body": "<center> http://news.psu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/threshold-992/public/popular%20bullied%20iStock%20omgimages.jpg </center>\n\nMy recent article I presented a case that nonviolent censorship and shunning are both fundamental features a non-violent government.  I made the case that it is entirely possible for non violent governments to have as much or even more power than their violent alternatives that exist today.   Anytime there is sufficient consensus among the masses, social pressure can be much more powerful a motivator than any prison sentence.  Sadly, social pressure can be manipulated and abused through propaganda to create negative outcomes.\n\n## Peer pressure usually operates in a pseudo pyramid  (@gikitiki)\n\nThis concept is an accurate observation.  There are leaders and followers and this is something that will always be true.  It is almost clich\u00e9 in movies that some popular \u201cbully\u201d steers the opinion of their lackeys.  People latch onto people and follow their opinions in an effort to improve their own social standing.   \n\nIt takes some major event to dislodge the followers from a bully.  The followers usually find a new leader and will blindly follow that leader. \n\n## People must own themselves (@williambanks) \n\nPeople need to form their own opinions.  This is the crux of many similar arguments.  In particular, if you don\u2019t take the time to derive your own opinion about someone then you are letting someone else control your thoughts.  This is claimed to be the opposite of freedom and anarchy. You are still a slave if someone else draws your conclusions for you.\n\nWe all want people to think for themselves.  It is the best defense against some psychopath gaining influence over the masses.  It demonstrates that people are taking *personal responsibility*.\n\nWhen you have a system of organized coordinated shunning of people whom you have never met, then you have a system of government that has the potential to be abused.  Whoever has the ability to manipulate the consensus algorithm has the power to make arbitrary law.  The masses who have bought into the consensus algorithm will follow it off a cliff if they do not think for themselves.\n\n<center>http://midwestpeaceprocess.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cap6-867x380.jpg</center>\nLike Larken Rose states, the *belief in authority* is the root of all evil. Whether that authority is with a government or a blockchain based consensus algorithm.  The moment people feel compelled to comply with an authority they become a tool to the system. \n\n## We need to Separate Ends from Means \n\nAnarchists frequently condemn statists for allowing the ends to justify the means.  Statists are willing to tolerate violence so long as the end result is a mostly peaceful society.  They have no guiding principle other than the outcome.\n\nWhen I set out to build a free society based upon the principle of nonaggression, the goal was to achieve \u201cgovernance without violence\u201d.   When I present my case for how it might work, many anarchists are suddenly concerned about the potential *outcomes* of a society based only on nonviolence and free association (or disassociation). \n\nWithout lifting a finger to hurt someone, society still has the power to condemn a man and any who help him to death by economic shunning. This is an unacceptable outcome to many anarchists.  Any system that is capable of coordinating this economic shunning would be perceived as a new threat: the new state.\n\nIn their mind they picture a utopia where there are no rulers or social forces acting on them in ways they do not like.  They imagine a world of free thinking individuals who are universally tolerant.  This kind of thinking is just as deranged as communists who think that one day everyone will be selfless and work for the common good.  \n\n## Is Non Aggression Enough?\n\nIf we are to build a system the bring about a society structured as closely to our ideals as possible, then it may be the case that non-aggression is a necessary but insufficient principle.  Imagine we succeeded in creating a world government based upon blockchain technology that had no police, prisons, or guns.   Imagine that it had the support of the masses.   \n\nNow imagine that the propaganda machine convinced the masses (via blockchain based economic incentives) to voluntarily shun everyone who refused a vaccine.  Imagine that anyone who amassed a certain amount of wealth was also shunned if they didn\u2019t give it away to a socially acceptable cause?  \n\n## Why there is nothing to Fear! \n\nFortunately we don\u2019t need to fear these potentially undesirable outcomes. Absent the fear of violence, any sufficiently large group of people who share a common belief would have the ability to form their own self-sustaining communities (effectively their own country).  The pursuit of freedom and profit will drive people to separate from the herd mentality.  \n\nAny kind of sustained shunning would be countered with underground movements where people secretly ignore the official consensus until enough people defect and the official consensus changes. \n\nThe power to shun is also the power to secede from the greater society to form your own smaller community.  Free market competition among communities is what will drive all communities toward the most profitable social arrangements.  \n\nSome people fear that these communities would eventually \"go to war\" against one another.  This would not be the case if all communities had the nonaggression principle as the foundation of their own governance structure.  \n\n## Division of Labor and Delegation of Responsibility\nIn order for any nonviolent community to scale beyond a couple dozen individuals, it is necessary for there to be a division of labor when it comes to reputation and policing the community.  It is not practical for everyone to derive their own opinion of every other member.  People must defer to someone they trust. \n\nThe reason we join societies and accept voluntary forms of governance (such as blockchain based voting), is because these societies and organizations provide us with more value than they take.  These organizations may have elected officials that are granted the power to make rules.  All that matters is that they do not have the power to use violence and aggression to enforce their rules.\n\nThis is what blockchain technology is all about, defining governance structures that people voluntarily consent to.  Some communities have simple rules like immutable censorship free money transmission.  Other communities have more complex rules like paying people for subjective work with a prohibition on plagiarism.   Still other communities may set their aims on replacing insurance, justice, and other aspects of government with effective non-violent alternatives.   \n\nWhat is clear is that for any community to scale, it must embrace division of labor and rely on algorithms to disintermediate reputation and coordinate social punishment.",

      "body": "<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\nhttp://www.thedigeratilife.com/images/market-emotions-2.jpg\n</div>\nSome people have suggested that we reduce the power down period to improve market liquidity.  I have been thinking about the economics of this and wanted to share my thoughts.  \n\n## Power Down Delay Slows Price Discovery \n\nPrice is the balance point between supply and demand at any given point in time.  The Power Down restrictions have the impact of holding *Supply* off the market.  Much of this *supply* wants to sell at today's price, but cannot.  The reason it *wants to sell* is because those doing the selling have earned a *massive* profit in a short period of time.  Their costs are next to nothing.  They will continue to sell until the price falls low enough that it isn't worth selling.  \n\nIf Steem Power were liquid, then the price would fall toward this equilibrium faster in a *race to the exits*.   The people that dump first win (in the short term) and the rest lose (in the short term).   There will always be a market value and the price will never go to 0 so long as there is at least one person who believes in the *potential value* of the platform.  My experience with BitShares and dozens of other cryptocurrency projects is that nothing with any community behind it will fall to 0.   Even simple Bitcoin clones that have been around for years and offer relatively little innovation with non-existent development teams (Doge, Peercoin, Namecoin) continue to be traded with $100K+ in daily volume with marketcap in the millions.     \n\n## Power Down makes Cashout more Fair \n\nWith a power down system, everyone is forced to \"dollar-cost-average\" their selling over 2 years.  This means that whales that might have cashed out $1M dollars at the height of the bubble were only able to cash out $50,000 at the high prices while they have watched their remaining Steem Power fall in value to $200,000.  Their average \"cashout\" price will not be the height of the market, but the market average over 2 years.  \n\nThis has pros and cons.  In some sense it limits the ability of speculators to buy and sell over periods of a couple of months.  Anyone speculating over more than a couple of days is paying a very large inflation tax.  The loss of this speculative capital impacts the liquidity and potentially the price.  We live in a world where traders want the ability to move to the next big thing and having capital tied up in the *last big thing* is a much riskier proposition. \n\n## Author Rewards\n\nAuthor Rewards are also designed to delay cashout by paying in Steem Dollars.  You could sell immediately at a loss, or you could \"trust and wait\" and make more.   As the price falls, the market value of the immediate author rewards also falls, but this is *OK*.   Authors looking for a quick buck need to go elsewhere.  Meanwhile, those who stay and work to grow the long-term value of the platform will gain in Steem Power.  When the value of the platform finally grows as a result of years of effort they will be the new whales.  \n\nYou may only get $10 worth of Steem Power for a post today.  It might not even seem to be worth your time, but if you and others stick around and grow the value of the platform then one day your $10 will be worth $400 if we grow the platform to Bitcoin scale.  If we grow to Facebook scale it will be worth $4000.   \n\n## Starting a Company\nThose who start a company are paid in shares that are worthless.  They cannot be sold on the market until one day in the distant future the company is successful and has an IPO.  The present value of the shares isn't what the entrepreneurial employees care about, it is the future value.  \n\nLikewise, a farmer who spends millions of dollars on land, equipment, and seeds works day in and day out in the hope that his farm will eventually produce a crop worth enough to justify his time and effort.  The farmer is in the red clear up until the day he brings his harvest to market.   \n\nDon't join Steemit for the quick buck.  Be glad there is someone willing to pay such high prices for a stake in Steem today.  Don't fear the fall in market value, look at the incredible amounts people are still earning.  Don't look at what you have today, look at what you could have in the future.  \n\nSteem is in the early adopter phase, those who work hard and help pull this platform forward will reap what they sow.  \n\n\n## Changing the Power Down Period\n\nIf we were to reduce the Power Down period from 2 years to 1 year or even 6 months, this would dramatically increase the net present value of Steem Power while simultaneously increase the amount of liquid Steem on the market in the short term.   The end result would be faster price discovery, but no one can say whether the new price will be higher or lower than the old price.  \n\nSome people speculate that value that is 2+ years in the future is discounted to near 0 value today (especially in the world of cryptocurrency).   This means that longer time horizons have diminishing marginal utility when it comes to encouraging voters to behave in the long-term best interest of the platform.\n\n## Emotional Response \n\nDespite all the logic in the world, humans have irrational feelings with respect to profit and loss.  Slow steady growth *feels* much better than *rapid rise* followed by *slow steady decline* even if both curves end up at the same final value (long term growth).  I for one prefer a slow steady rise, but that isn't possible until after the *rapid rise* has fully corrected and realigned.  This will take time and won't happen until after fear, desperation, panic, and despondency set in.\n\nThose who know about this emotional roller coaster can ride the waves and maximize their profit, but most people give in to their irrational emotional side and buy high and sell low.  My preference is to sell high and buy low.    \n\nDon't let the market price set your opinion on the value of a platform, instead make rational buy / sell decisions that factor in both short-term trends and long-term value.  This applies to any investment you might consider.",

      "body": "Good job gathering statistics.  I would like to point out some extra facts for those concerned about the fall in diversity of miners.\n\n## 50+ Runner Up Witnesses \n\nIn addition to the top 19 witnesses, there are over 50 accounts that produce blocks at least once per day if not many times per hour.  Combine this with the top 19 witnesses and the top two miners and you get over 70 unique individuals producing blocks on a daily basis.   \n\nTo put this in perspective, there can be at most 144 unique individuals producing blocks on a daily basis with Bitcoin.   In any given hour only 6 unique individuals produce and validate Bitcoin blocks, whereas Steem has at least 30+ unique individuals per hour (maybe much more, I didn't actually count).  \n\nThe numbers 144 and 6 are assuming all blocks are produced by *different people*, but in reality only 9 unique individuals (pools) confirm blocks each day.  In any given hour less than 5 people confirm blocks because some pools get lucky and produce twice in the same hour.  Imagine rolling a 9 sided die 6 times, [the probability that a given hour will have the same pool selected twice is 90%](https://lazycackle.com/birthday-problem-calculator.html).\n\n## Purpose of Proof of Work \n\nThe purpose of Proof of Work is to make the blockchain computationally expensive to forge.  Regardless of how many unique individuals are mining, we know that a certain number of calculations must be performed for a given proof of work threshold.  \n\nSomeone who implements a GPU algorithm is able to perform these calculations more cheaply than someone with a CPU.  This increases their profit margins.   The market always responds when someone is earning guaranteed oversized profits.  Right now the proof of work is rewarding those who did the *programing work* necessary to increase computations.  \n\n## Transactions as Proof of Stake \n\nEvery user who uses the blockchain is also participating in directly confirming the current blockchain state.  Each transaction includes the block ID of a recent block. A forged chain would be unable to migrate all of the user activity and therefore is easily identifiable by simply looking at the stake-weighted average time since each account last transacted.  \n\nSteem is secure, the market for computational power is functioning, things will evolve just as they did with Bitcoin.  One day there may even be ASIC miners.",

We can now announce that in the past few hours, the Steemit team has been able to coordinate with elected witnesses to secure potentially compromised accounts with balances exceeding $100 US. As a result, we can ensure these accounts are restored to their rightful owners. This process has been completed.\n\nWithin the next 48 hours, Steemit will begin to allow all newly secured accounts to reset their passwords simply by logging in with the same Facebook or Reddit credentials that were used to register in the first place. This easy process will work for the vast majority of the potentially compromised accounts. All of these account holders will regain full access to their funds and their original account name. \n\nIf your user account was not created through Facebook or Reddit, Steemit asks that you contact our support team at contact@steemit.com. We will be able to provide you an alternate solution. If you have any additional concerns about your account, please contact our support team as well.\n\nThe Bittrex team is completing analysis of our wallet. Once it has passed their rigorous compliance checks, they will reopen the wallet for deposits and withdrawals.\n\n## To all Steemit users:\n\n If you have not done so already, please reset your account passwords. We ask this to ensure that everyone's account is secure. Remember that each account has 3 keys: an Owner Key, an Active Key, and a Posting Key. We recommend following best security practices by choosing unique passwords for each of these keys. This will allow you to safely use steemit.com with your Posting password.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, any Steem or Steem Dollars stolen from compromised accounts will be fully refunded by Steemit.\n\nThank you all for your patience and support through this process and for your wonderful contributions to Steemit.\n\n-Ned\n\n[Previous Update Here](/steemit/@steemitblog/important-security-announcement-steemit-ceo-ned-scott)",

      "body": "Great question and, unfortunately, I don't have a great answer. I think, however, that an economic value judgment produced in a smaller community that creates its own currency is more accurate than, say, a central bank doing it on the basis of aggregate transactions for the whole economy. And, in the case of blogging, the central bank would traditionally not even consider it economic activity because it is unpaid. Can the smaller group be wrong? Of course. Can they be controlled by influential individuals? Yes. All human groups can have these flaws. The model here is still being tested but it looks like progress and decentralization is usually a good thing.",

      "body": "<html>\n<p>Recently, a young engineer asked me for some general advice about starting out in the workplace. He was starting his first job as a mechanical/aerospace engineering trainee with a large organization. I'm 50 and have been an engineer (or engineering manager) all my working life. Fwiw, I thought I'd share what I told him with you:</p>\n<p>This is standard stuff but I find that it works pretty well in practice:</p>\n<p>1) Be extremely responsive to the folks you work for at the new company. You can think of them as your clients. And no matter what their official rank, think of everyone as your client.</p>\n<p>2) Your goal is to add value to the organization and you may have to do jobs outside your field of interest or expertise. Jobs you may think of as beneath you. Do them anyway and do them enthusiastically. People will notice.</p>\n<p>3) Disregard a workplace culture which distracts you from actual work. Even if no one seems to care, you are there to work and if you do, it will be noticed. It's ok to be friendly and chat with your coworkers and neighbors, but maintain a general attitude of always wanting to get things done.</p>\n<p>4) Avoid office politics. This is hard to do, especially as your career progresses, but try hard to do it. There is no way to navigate the political waters of an unknown organization and come out ahead. The best way to do this is by not taking sides, maintaining an objective focus, not talking about others, and pretending a general unawareness of whatever political situation is being offered for comment.</p>\n<p>5) Get along with people. Be friendly and always willing to help. Be especially sensitive about issues of discrimination or other legal policies of the company. Remember that the company may be filled with many people of differing ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds. You are expected to get along with all of them. Breaking these rules, btw, can lead to a very quick dismissal.</p>\n<p>6) Learn as much as you can about the company and the technology you are working on. Trainees are often dismissed because it is assumed they don't know much and don't want to learn. Break out of that mold.</p>\n<p>7) Try to relate what you are doing on the job to what you learned in school. If you didn't take a class in the area you are working in, try to educate yourself through books, the internet, etc. There is usually a fundamental textbook or theory behind what they are doing. It pays to learn it.</p>\n<p>Just remember, companies are usually quite willing to invest in their promising young workers. So being identified as promising is what you need to do.</p>\n</html>",

      "body": "I had an idea about **Steemit billboard** from the beginning and I created one. After I finished my design, yes I'm not designer :) I paid for printing. My idea was simple, I will put that poster anyway, but with the help of the community it could end up on the best possible location. \n![Sequence02.Still003300c6.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/15/Sequence02.Still003300c6.jpg)\n\nAt the very beginning someone gave me a flag so I was hidden for most voters. In that post I presented the idea and showed the video of my poster in front of the Billboard filmed from the air.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/07/26/vlcsnap-2016-07-26-18h35m24s7418a65f.jpg\n It was nice video but  I removed it (in a rage) from my YouTube channel. Don't do that, there are no undo option in Youtube.\n\n\n\nThis account was hacked so in the hurry, someone also put similar plan on the Steemit, I used my other account (@sir) for that post; https://steemit.com/steem/@sir/first-advertising-billboard-for-steemit-is-ready-in-croatia-video. After really bad start, my post was flaged, I asked (as AGS investor) for help from the #Bitshares community. Trough that community I bought this account in the early days when was impossible to create one. I may be only idiot who paid for Steemit account. \n\nAfter my call I received almost $300 and everything was as I expected. I was so thrilled that I invited (real) friends not just those from Facebook and Twitter to join Steemit. 'Collected' money was not enough to finance any Billboard location but that was fine for me  because I knew that I did not make a masterpiece.\n\nThan came mighty **@dantheman** with all his power and downvoted my post, he took all the money. What can I do after that? Of course my first reaction was -  I will leave Steemit. @dantheman or Dan Larimer is Mark Zuckenberg of Steemit and I have no other options.  \n\nAs I promised I placed the poster. Somebody must have noticed, is located in a great place, Zagreb's main avenue - [Ljubljanska avenija.](https://www.google.hr/maps/place/Ljubljanska+avenija,+10000,+Zagreb/@45.7974363,15.8781815,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1scity+center+near+Ljubljanska+avenija,+Zagreb!3m4!1s0x4765d17aeed55db5:0xf1794356637a81c5!8m2!3d45.7974363!4d15.8803702?hl=en&hl=en)\n\nI learned my lessons first as AGS investor and now again. I have no doubt @dantheman is brilliant programmer and blockchain visionary but he really need to rework Steem voting system - and some other things ... Too much power in one's hands can not be good.\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/L_IwccM-kJA\n\nThis post is just proof that I did it. Billboard is there for more than a week. Thank you again @stan.",

      "body": "http://i.imgur.com/233fZ9Q.png\n\nIt was mid-afternoon on a Thursday. I was looking for new coin Announcements to troll. All of a sudden I spot it: [ANN][STEEM][POW] - NO IPO | NO PREMINE | NO INSTAMINE (relaunch). \nMy face starts converting into the shape of a troll. I had attempted to mine it on the original launch, but never got past compilation. This time, I started digging through the github, and I was blown away. It was not some basic cookie-cutter clonecoin. It was something that took a lot of time and effort. I still could not figure out how to get mining though. So, I did as any greedy troll would do, I started demanding info from the developers(it was an account named reverseflash at the time). Everyone was patient with me, and I was able to get mining. I still was under assumption that this was just another shitcoin. I had no idea it would become the base of what steemit.com was built on. But, like any greedy troll, I did not want to miss out....just in case. \n\nI eventually made a post to help others compile the original version of steemd and the cli_wallet. I like to think that it helped many people get started that would not have been able to. It was the first step-by-step guide, but eventually once steemit.com was released, a couple people copied my guide word for word basically and got paid pretty nice for it. Glad I could help out a little there too.\n\nI never did become a member of the steemit.com. I had been pretty rude a few times in the early days in the thread. Also, blogging was never really my thing. I was a troll...but I like to think a white-hat troll.  The main purpose of the panadacoin bitcointalk account was so I could troll shitty coins, and maybe save some people from losing money, while having the anonymity of a joke account. I even wore a shitty sig for yobit for a while cause I figured I may as well get paid for trolling. It was just a bad coincidence that the largest of my mining accounts would be named after a troll that I was embarrassed to be associated with. \n\nWell, time went on. Steemit.com blew up to sizes beyond almost anyones expectations. I started wanting to be a bigger part of it but did not know where/how to start. I learned about curating and started practicing that. But it was boring just voting and never talking, so I lost interest pretty quick. \n\nI would like to start contributing more, maybe writing some posts in the future. I apologize to anyone I was rude to in the mining launch, whoever was in control of thereverseflash account. And also, I hope I helped some of you get started mining with my early compiling guide. And I apologize for only powering down and not really contributing before. But remember please, I started this as a miner, I had no idea what it would become.",

With this technique you can confidently analyze recipes and create custom versions that work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is an example for banana bread (but it will work for any recipe). Setup a spreadsheet or sketch a chart on a sheet of paper. In the first column, list the ingredients for the recipe. It is helpful to leave some space between the ingredients so that you can include special notes or similar ingredients. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s31.postimg.org/sd4vattkb/banana_bread_spread_sheet.png\" width=\"519\" height=\"640\"/></p>\n<p>Across the top of the chart, title each column with where you found the recipe, such as my recipe, Nana, cook book Susan, website Carol E., Church, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now list the amounts of each ingredients required for the recipe. Keep it simple in the beginning, so you can see what is different and what is the same in each recipe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In our example recipes, one uses butter and the other uses oil. Also the leavening agents are different: one uses only baking soda and the other uses baking soda and baking powder. Now you have a clear way to see the differences between recipes. You can make the personal decision of whether you like the taste of butter or oil in your baked goods. This is a process but you will eventually make one that is just right for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Analyzing multiple recipes this way can also be beneficial if you're trying to keep to some form of diet (weight loss, low salt, low cholesterol, etc). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Remember to have fun and improve until you have a great recipe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eat and Enjoy! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

I created this recipe by using the compare method that I posted at \u00a0<a href=\"https://steemit.com/recipes/@benita/how-to-compare-multiple-recipes-for-the-same-dish\">How to Compare Multiple Recipes for the Same Dish</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>MARINATED RAISINS</p>\n<p>3 tablespoons Sherry (can substitute white grape juice or buttermilk)</p>\n<p>1 cup raisins</p>\n<p>MAIN INGREDIENTS</p>\n<p>4 cups all purpose flour</p>\n<p>1/2 cup sugar</p>\n<p>1 tablespoon baking powder</p>\n<p>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</p>\n<p>2 sticks frozen salted butter (1/2 pound)</p>\n<p>1 1/4 cups buttermilk</p>\n<p>TOPPING</p>\n<p>1/4 cup coarse sugar (turbinado) and some extra buttermilk for the topping</p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Soak the raisins in the sherry for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda. Roughly chop the frozen butter with a knife into chunks, then cut it into the dry ingredients using a pastry blender or your fingertips. Add in the buttermilk and sherry soaked raisins. Then lightly mix just until the ingredients are evenly distributed. Over mixing will make the scones have a denser texture. The dough will be a little dry and a bit crumbly, but that is normal for scones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turn dough onto a floured surface and gently knead it together. Divide the dough in half. Working with one half at a time, gently form the dough into an 8 inch circle about 1 inch thick. Cut into 6-8 wedges depending on size you want. Then repeat with remaining dough.</p>\n<p>Place the wedges on a parchment covered baking sheet, leaving about a half inch between them. \u00a0Brush the tops of the wedges with the extra buttermilk and then sprinkle with the coarse sugar.</p>\n<p>Bake for 25-30 minutes or until lightly browned on top. This recipe makes about 12-16 scones. I hope you love these as much as my family loves them!</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><br /></p>",

I ended up using canola oil, because I was worried that the other options might add a weird flavor, but the lime and cardamom are so strong I don't think it would have made a difference. I also needed to increase the cooking time, because they were a bit doughy at 14 minutes, but that might just be my oven. The texture of the scones is a little denser than my normal butter based scones, but they are still great and flavors are new and weirdly fun.

As such they don't necessarily have the same market value. Of course, we don't know in advance what those values will be, but ignoring the difference altogether causes the analysis to be incorrect.\n\nLooking toward maximizing the market cap (and, assuming no total supply change, equivalently the value of the SP unit), at least as one consideration, makes a lot of sense.",

If the liquidity rewards were more accessible to others then more would be competing to provide liquidity by leaving more orders on the book and narrowing the spread. The more populated book and narrower spread would in turn would make successful self-trading much harder. Systems like this can reach multiple equilibria, and it is very possible that another one would serve the community better than what is happening now.\n\nI think you should try simply providing liquidity and not self-trading for a while, and if others provide better liquidity, either compete on that basis or let them get the rewards for providing the service, which encourages more and more of it. I can't tell you what to do though, this is just my opinion.\n\nAs for the bot losing, well, that is part of the (distribution) game.

But there is no way to find that out without trying.\n\nThere are many names on that list who are not being rewarded even though they have likely provided liquidity to the market and would likely do so again if rewarded for it. Providing liquidity also becomes easier for others if they are receiving rewards (even occasionally) since there is no other good way to have access to liquid steem without incurring an opportunity cost.\n\nThe most successful tit-for-tat strategies will forgive occasionally to attempt to test a return to a cooperative equilibrium.

Look around you. The most commercially successful music is cookie cutter. The most successful TV shows are dumb. Nobody even buys books any more at all (other than maybe romance novels?). One of the top posts at reddit right now (5000 votes) is: \"Excluding my mom, what's the worst sex you've ever had?\"\n\nWhat is successful is what addresses the market as it exists, and that includes a great deal of demand for shallow content and being popular for being popular.\n\nAlso, implemention factors are very important. Voting is processed by the consensus code which needs to not only be kept relatively simple but also very high performance. This doesn't mean that your ideas can't work but to be a credible proposal you need to completely specify how and when the various processing steps occur. Of course that can be the subject of later posts.",

      "body": "Agree overall on most most points. Re. implementation, payouts are transactions too. Currently those perform a relatively simple calculations based on shares, and those transactions would need to remain limited in computational cost. I don't think this proposal changes that much though, it just has more complicated (but still computationally simple) accounting of shares by clutser. My concern is primarily the k-means clustering;  Incremental k-means variants exist, so it is probably solvable. \n\nAlso, dividing users into clusters requires a minimum number of users in each cluster, thus a minimum number of users on the site as a while. At present I doubt that is feasible as the number of users on the site is just barely reaching the point where it works at all. Ideally of course the number of users will be much larger in the future, so something like this could be phased in.",

      "body": "\"People who get to earn the equivalent of a CEO of a Fortune 500\"\n\nThis somewhat relevant because witnesses do more than run a node, they are also part of the governance process of the network by deciding which versions to run,  generally providing input to the developer team, and serving as a conduit for representative stakeholder influence over the direction of Steem. In the great debate over the curation rewards (8.2/8.3 debate), witnesses were called upon to decide which version to accept going forward. The developer team frequently requests input and feedback from witnesses on the content of upcoming releases.\n\nThus you I suggest that one should choose witnesses not only based on whether blocks are signed, price feeds are updated, the money is channeled elsewhere, etc. but also based on the experience, expertise, judgement, vested interest in the success of the system, and character of the witness. \n\nThe Steem ecosystem is now approaching $500 million in market cap and while we may not quite need 19 Fortune 500 CEOs worth of qualifications yet, there may well come a time that 19 witnesses of that stature and caliber would be the best thing possible. We certainly do want highly experienced, highly vested, and highly capable witnesses who are best suited to represent the diverse interests in the Steem ecosystem and make excellent decisions about what makes a blockchain successful, not just server jockeys and grant administrators. Those sorts of qualifications do not come cheap, and if there is too much focus on witnesses as pass-throughs for money, then it will turn into a race to the bottom on compensation and the best qualified by the above criteria will certainly drop out.\n\nWhether all of the current 19 full-time witnesses are the ideal people for the job is something that the voters can decide. My personal opinion is that there are too many witnesses who are there primarily or entirely by virtue of their history with the Bitshares community, and I'd like to see at least one or more from the blogging/marketing side, though last point may be a bit of a challenge since the job does also require experience managing security-critical IT infrastructure (either directly or managing other people to do it). That combination may be quite scarce.\n\nFinally one should not dismiss too easily the costs of the actual infrastructure as Steemit continues to scale up. How much do you think Reddit spends on servers, etc.? Well each witness is something like 1/19 of the backbone infrastructure of Steemit and will be eventually be spending something similar. (Already the costs to run a _good_ witness node, along with associated seed nodes, including redundancy and headroom to not fail in the presence of viral growth, are not trivial.) One of the witnesses (sorry I don't recall which) has stated his opinion that each of the 19 witness slots will over time evolve into significant businesses each managing a data center and significant staff. If so then in addition to the above qualifications, witnesses also need to possess the capability to manage all aspects of this sort of rapidly-growing business without major mishaps, mismanagement, and down time. Again, you do not want the best qualified to drop out and leave the network in less capable hands.",

The main reason I do this is I see most of the other witnesses using a script and I want to maximize diversity in the method for the reasons I described. I can't speak to the specific methods that others use.\n\nAs far as why it is important, it is used for two things. One is the awarding of SD author rewards. Half the Steem paid out from the reward fund is converted to SD using the feed price. The other is the \"Convert SD to Steem\" operation, which converts on demand using the feed price one week later. (Most people should not be using the latter, by the way; it is intended to be a part of the inner workings of the pegging mechanism to be used, if at all, by expert traders when necessary. In my opinion it is a mistake that it is even available on the web site, and certainly that it is highly prominent where many have chosen it by mistake.)\n\nEDIT: Also dollar values displayed on the site use the price feed as an exchange rate, but that is somewhat arbitrary.

      "body": "Why would you not expect the subscription fee to increase? The more popular Steem becomes the more access to the network is worth. Think of it like Paypal. Initially they paid people $10 to open an account, then transactions were entirely free for everyone. Then slowly various exceptions to free transactions were added to the point now where a huge portion of transactions now pay fees. Likewise Google. For years there were no ads at all. Then just a one line of text. Then a sidebar. Now there are sponsored search results that take significant effort to read through and ignore if you want to find the organic search results. The price went up. A lot.\n\nSteem is much the same. Right now the network is almost worthless, except as a promise. If all you were buying is a subscription to the current network with its current users and no prospects for growth, a fair price of that would be approximately zero. Now imagine a future where almost everyone is on Steem and that is one of the primary vehicles that people use to share information, communicate, and exchange payments; what will it be worth to not be excluded?\n\nBuying Steem Power now means you are buying access to the future network at something closer to the current network value.",

      "body": "A few comments:\n\n#### Sybil attacks\n\nThe way to stop Sybil attacks is to stop creating ways for Sybils to attack. For example, the recent change to posting rewards directly incentivizes Sybil attacks (I don't know whether they are already occurring, but I suspect yes) by those wanting to spam low quality posts out of a hope that some of them, even a small number, produce rewards  (comment spamming is the same, and is not currently Sybil attacked because comments don't yet have a per-account quota, but introduce such a quota and that is exactly what will happen). \n\nAnother example is the Hot view, which uses vote count as a metric. This was originally the front page and was moved to an alternate view because it clearly incentivizes Sybil attacks. I think it should be removed altogether. Likewise, displaying vote count on posts is pointless and misleading and also, albeit more subtly, incentivizes Sybil attacks (a post or comment getting more attention and attracting real votes because it already \"has many votes\"). Instead posts should include some normalized and/or summarized indication of vote weight (weighted stake)\n\nUnfortunately, a number of the recent changes including the aforementioned posting quota have ignored these core principles of not granting weight to \"accounts\". The result is that in trying to address one problem, more are created. I hope that the reputation system Steemit plans to implement, and generally speaking knee-jerk reactions to a \"Bot Crisis\" do not make similar errors, but I expect that if great care is not taken to slow down and think things though, they probably will.\n\n#### PoW accounts\n\nPoW accounts should not be removed. They are an extremely valuable way for controversial, censored, or otherwise at-risk people to obtain access and publish information (possible very highly valued information) without needing to link with some external resources (social media account, etc.), which could literally put their lives at risk in the most extreme cases or at least discourage coming forward in the less extreme cases. Anonymous whistle-blowers, political dissidents, and others in this group deserve our greatest respect and accommodation if the idea of censorship resistance is to mean anything (popular ideas are rarely censored). But more importantly, the entire approach of limiting access rather than widening it is focusing efforts on exactly the wrong direction, but I'll get to that later in the next section, after discussing the reality of PoW accounts.\n\nIn point of fact, if you look at the current swarm of bots, approximately zero of them are PoW accounts (please go and look if you are unsure about this). They are all, or nearly all, Steemit-provided accounts. In all likelihood, it is much cheaper and easier to obtain _large numbers_ of  accounts via Steemit signups rather than mining (also the Steemit-provided accounts come with free SP, significant in large numbers, which means they have negative cost; as long as that continues, those wanting to create accounts for profit rather than for use will likely continue using that route). Not only is the mining difficulty significant, but the _maximum possible_ number of PoW accounts created per day is 1372, and this theoretical number _greatly overstates_ the maximum feasible number, because there are high-powered miners competing for, and winning, most blocks who do not create new accounts with each block (for good reasons). In summary, disabling PoW accounts is an example of a reactive response that does not solve any real problem, but comes with a very real cost.\n\n#### Facebook, Reddit, and growth\n\nYou suggest that Reddit account signups be removed and only Facebook be allowed. This is misguided. Not only are fraudulent Facebook accounts plentiful, easy to create, and regularly used in high profile frauds (including some involving massive numbers of such accounts), but this approach is entirely self-defeating. \n\nReflexively one might suggest that access to accounts be further limited and more verification be added. I've even suggested this myself, as an initial reaction to The Bot Problem, but I now realize that was a bad idea. In fact, as the site continues to expand it will probably make sense -- and be inevitable to prevent a growth bottleneck -- to open up registrations even wider (examples: retail purchase of an \"access card\", email registration, mobile registration, etc.). Many of these accounts will be obtained fraudulently and/or resold. The system must be designed to accept this reality and minimize negative impacts from it.  \n\nThis inevitable widening of access _will_ create more ability to Sybil attack, _but only if the number of accounts controlled by an individual actually matters in any way_.  This problem can only be solved without putting harmful obstacles in the way of new users (which is a _very big deal_ if you want the platform to rapidly grow to truly massive scale) by refocusing efforts on ensuring that Sybil attacking gains no advantage and also causes no real harm (see #1 above). The so-called Bot Crisis is a crisis primarily because it threatens to unleash a new round of poorly-thought-out changes that will make mattes worse. One might even speculate on whether it could be intended to do just that. \n\n#### Short term solutions\n\nThe efforts of \"the good guys\" have caused most of the abusive bots to be hidden and earn no rewards, removing most of the incentives for people to create them. (If the idea is to just spam the blockchain, that can be done in any number of ways.) Slight tweaks to the UI can improve this further without collateral damage. For example, I suggested replacing  individually hidden comments with a summary line (\"13 comments hidden, click to show\"). @svk even prototyped this and showed me some very nice screen shots. Rolling that out on the site would make most of the abusive bots invisible and a non-issue. Removing from the UI any remaining emphasis on \"vote count\" as a useful concept would address the rest.",

The thing to be aware of is that SP is a highly risky, illiquid investment (meaning you can't get your money out quickly) while SBD is liquid and most of the time should be stable. SP _could_ certainly pay off more over time but that is not guaranteed. Study both carefully and make the decision that best fits your own situation.",

      "body": "> For the Hot view, I do not think it should be removed, just reworked\n\nSure. My objection of course is not the name Hot, just the idea of a leaderboard based specifically on vote count. Using a different metric as you suggest is fine. There could be numerous such useful rankings.\n\n> Of course, with the ability to create accounts through reg fee, or buy and sell accounts, they would still have anonymous means\n\nThese accounts are still always linked to a creator account. PoW accounts are not. Possibly by some means of buying and selling these could be obtained anonymously (and that probably will occur, for people who want more anonymous accounts than can be obtained via PoW), but it is significantly harder and increases the risk of being traced, which in turn could then transfer some of the risk to the seller. In cases of abuse this might be considered acceptable, but in cases of valued minority expression it is not.\n\n> I did notice a lot of accounts in bot swarms are Steemit provided, which makes me think people are just using reddit\n\nAgain I think you dismiss too easily fake Facebook accounts. I'm not sure why. Many people I know who aren't even online scammers have multiple Facebook accounts. Scammers create them by the thousands. (Not to dismiss Reddit account scamming either, that  is also clearly rampant, and you may be right this is currently the low-hanging fruit, but removing it would just shift that to Facebook, while obstructing some, possibly many, legitimate users who don't use Facebook.)\n\n> other people have suggested removing the dollar value of a post to reduce jealousy, and I understand their point to ... Unfortunately that leaves us at an impass, as these two ideas remove both the metrics we have!\n\nUnlike vote count, dollar value is a meaningful quantity that is not arbitrarily manipulated using Sybil accounts. Nevertheless, I specifically mentioned in my first comment another metric, weighted vote share, by which I mean a count of SP voting (possibly normalized or summarized). This is different from dollars because it doesn't apply the reward formula rules. Using this in place of vote count would still allow hiding dollars, if people want to do that.",

      "body": "I agree about blogging vs. chatting. One of the most interesting things I've seen on Steemit is the growth of activity in comments. In the earlier days with a much smaller user base, there were few comments even on the top paid posts. In fact comments were so neglected that there was at one point a proposal to explicitly subsidize comment posting with a dedicated portion of the reward pool. That proposal was dropped, but nevertheless, as the user base grew, comments have  taken off to where most decent posts, whether highly rewarded or not, generate a significant tree of discussion and many good ideas are developed in comments.\n\nAnecdotally I hate blogs that disable comments and usually don't return to them more than once or twice. Whether I comment or not, I still want to see what others have to say about the post, and if the poster isn't allowing comments that could potentially challenge their claims, I'm less willing to take what they have to say seriously. The days of one-way information dissemination are over.\n\nOverall this was a good post with useful analysis of the competitive landscape.",

Even though the site has grown tremendously and it is hard for good writers and posts to be discovered, it still can be done. A bit of advice: focus on promoting yourself and your brand. Reach out to the people who create lists of the best posts, up and coming new writers, etc. Be inventive and come up with ideas to really stand out. As a marketer you know the importance of building a customer base, and blogging is no different. All the best.",

      "body": "I actually disagree with abit on whether the post is reward-worthy. The reason being it points to a very serious problem with the rep system. Downvotes from high SP users, including casual ones over mildly inappropriate content or even misclicks or \"drunk downvotes\" can cause very serious damage to reputation. \n\nFurther I disagree with having initialized the rep scores based on old downvotes that were never intended to have that effect at the time they were made (since the effect did not exist).\n\nLooking at alphabeta's past posts, he's someone who has been active in the community, involved with mining, but is not a star blogger or whale who can easily accumulate a lot of positive rep points allowing him to withstand even a single whale (or semi-whale, maybe even less) downvote. Having both the possibility and the reality of such severe and long-term damage to any user's Steem experience due to one single click from anyone is not a favorable path forward. Even that one single person happens to be the lead developer and founder. Perhaps especially then.\n\nThank you for pointing this out alphabeta. I gave you an upvote and restored your rep.",

It may seem unfair that a (somewhat) famous Playboy model or a well known writer will be more highly rewarded than others, and in some ways it is; life is not fair. But I don't agree you are a nobody, even if you are not famous. \n\nEverybody is a somebody and everyone has stories to tell, experiences to share, and lessons learned in life that can help others. That is all part of connecting with other human beings. The more you post and _contribute_ to discussions in the comment streams them more value you add and the more other people will want to give back. That is only natural.\n\nThanks again for the introduction and welcome to Steemit.",

      "body": "> Commenting is a curation reward?\n\nCommenting isn't by itself a curation reward. There was a proposal at one point to dedicate a portion of rewards specifically to comments, but it wasn't adopted. Comments are rewarded based on upvotes like anything else.\n\nHowever, where the advice makes sense is the fact that it has now become common for good comments to get at least an upvote or two, sometimes more than that. And as the author of a comment, you earn the _author_ portion of the reward (75%) rather than the _curator_ portion (25%). On this thread there are many comments earning $0.01-0.20 each. That may not sound like a lot by itself, but if you are engaging in a good conversation and write a few comments, you can collect a few of these little reward morsels on one post without writing anywhere near as much as a new post (or as much as I did here). So it can really boost your rewards.",

All it takes is someone with a few bots and they can censor any post or comment that they want.\n\nYou are misunderstanding how this works. Unlike reddit where is is indeed documented that sock puppet bot armies can censor posts by downvoting them, in Steem, stake-based voting means that such tactics are ineffective. If someone wants to take stake that he owns and turn it into a bunch of bot accounts, that does not in any way gain influence over what could have been achieved using that same stake in a single account (in fact it is very slightly weaker).\n\nMost of the bots on Steem are harmless gnats with little stake that are doing not much of anything except trying to make a tiny reward here and there, or perhaps cause annoyance and FUD. Your posts and comments got hidden because they were flagged by a majority of the stake that voted on them, not because of bots.",

However, if the protests are successful and bring about change to bad policies then it is the citizens, property and businesses that benefit from a more just and productive society over the longer term.

But maybe I'm even wrong about that. How was the initial distribution done?\n\nI still don't quite follow the logic on why that makes the inflationary STEEM token itself good for them, when everyone else can avoid the inflation by using SP too. If anything, given their large SP holdings, the restrictions on liquidity of SP  hurts them as much or more than anyone else, but in any case, here's some info about the launch. \n\nIt was effectively (but not literally) an 80% premine (though not quite free; they had to compete with a few other miners and did apparently spend money to do this).  They launched with a public bitcointalk thread (still there) but there were no instructions or other information so only those able to figure it out from the code were able to mine it. It was openly stated at this time why the developers were doing this.\n\nThe plan (then and now) for the 80% is to give away 40% (every new account needs coins and receives a minimum balance\u2013currently 3 SP\u2013for free), keep 20%, and sell 20% to pay for development. This process is reasonably transparent and can be tracked by watching the 'steemit' account and the ones fed from there ('steem' creates the new accounts for example).",

But SBD and STEEM can be withdrawn into my own local wallet and freely traded? Except I seem to remember there's a 1 week delay with SBD withdrawals. Can I hold SBD in my own wallet and earn rewards, or do I only get rewards if I have steemit.com hold them? Am I totally misunderstanding everything?\n\nSBD currently earns 10% interest (rate is variable) and SP earns anti-dilution payments that offset most of the STEEM inflation. You can hold SP (or STEEM or SBD) in your own wallet with your own private keys, and there is no disadvantage to doing so in terms of rewards, etc. The web site is really just a web wallet that gives you a view of the blockchain. There are no restrictions at all on transfers of STEEM or SBD. SP is locked up and can only be converted to STEEM 1/104 per week (with a one week delay before first conversion when starting the process). SBD can be converted to about 1 USD worth of STEEM with a one-week delay, but this is an optional function that supports the pegging of its value and never required (alternately you can transfer it and/or trade it on a regular exchange or via the internal market with no delays)",

This doesn't mean you shouldn't do it\u2013I have been a Monero solo miner for two years and an enthusiastic supporter of solo mining as better for the network and often better for the miner\u2013but you need to be prepared for these waits and the inherent luck factor.\n\nIf you have enough of a hash rate to get blocks reasonable often when solo mining, then it is a no brainer, IMO. You not only help the network, and come out ahead in terms of less less risk of being ripped off by a dishonest pool, but you also gain from lower transactions fees since you wont be receiving a lot of small pool payments.",

      "body": "The differences need not be small. If the price of STEEM drops rapidly over the course of the week, or potentially worse first rises and then falls, the results of conversion may be much worse than trading. Also conversion gets you STEEM. If the goal is to cash out then you haven't solved the problem by converting; you still need to trade STEEM for BTC and those markets also have spreads and liquidity issues. I'm not saying it is bad to do by any means, just that it isn't an automatic win over trading. Trading using the internal exchange is another option which avoids any issues with exchanges and their wallets. Currently the liquidity on the internal exchange is rather poor, but I think it will improve.",

There were some other issues with it but that is the key conceptual error that undermines the viability of it entirely.\n\nAlso, some sort of superlinear payoff is needed otherwise the incentives favor voting for your own posts regardless of popularity or merit, either directly or via shill voting. \n\nIn thinking about this quite a bit over the past few months I've also come to believe that superlinear payoff is  economically correct for a platform like Steemit, because only posts that are of interest to a large number of people benefit from being shared in this manner. If something is only of interest to a few people (dinner plans for example), it is better to share it privately via email (or private Steemit messages once that is implemented!) and not impose both the resource and clutter costs of sharing it with thousands or millions. So something of interest to 100 or 1000 is worth more than 10x or 100x something of interest to only 10; the latter probably has close to zero or possibly negative value (once costs are considered) on Steemit.\n\nAll of this is not to rule out that tweaks to the current model might be helpful, but getting all the incentives right after considering all the relevant factors is much harder (and I would suggest the current system is much better than many of its detractors claim) than just wanting to make them \"more fair\". It is also not always so easy to see the various perspectives on how the current system performs multiple useful (and even essential) functions, when focusing in narrowly on one aspect of it such as perceived fairness.\n\nI do like the idea of providing some sort of incentive for valued downvotes; perhaps some  version of these ideas could be applied in a more limited manner to do that. But even there, getting all the incentives right and avoiding opening up vectors for abuse is not easy.",

Yes it is true that the pool is literally zero-sum as long as the STEEM price doesn't change, but the effect is pretty modest. Currently the reward pool is about $100 000 per day.  On the day he made $15K, approximately $85K went other posts. If you didn't earn, it is because your post didn't gain an audience and get votes. It is not because TDV took all the money.\n\nIn fact there is concrete proof of this. If I recall correctly, the very same day that TDV got $15K, the Playmate got $12K (sorry if not exact number). His success did not prevent her from also doing well nor did her success stop him from doing the same. And despite both of them getting historic payouts on the very same day, _73% of the reward pool was still available_ for other posts.\n\nIf your posts aren't getting rewarded, focus on marketing and promoting to develop an audience and improving the quality of the posts to increase conversions (how many people who see the posts vote for them). Pointing at someone else who is (in some vague sense) responsible for you not geting 15% of the reward pool rather than focusing on why you aren't getting a piece of the other 85% and what you can do to change that is doing yourself a disservice.",

If you want to earn on this platform and you aren't a celebrity with a following, you need to get out there and tell people about yourself. Get on steemit.chat and network. Reach out to the more successful bloggers and see if you can get them to mention you. Get your existing network to join and vote up your stuff. There are some people doing daily \"Best of Steemit\" posts which feature new personalities and content; try to get listed in one or more of those.\n\nGetting out and doing promotional work is great, and writing good quality posts is great too. But neither of those will get you rewards if no one knows about it. TDV is great at self-promotion, and while self-promotion can become annoying and turn people off if it is excessive and if there isn't substance behind it, in the right quantity it is an essential part of being successful at almost anything.\n\nEDIT: and positivity as other stated. Can't emphasize that enough.",

**Developer-friendly microservice powering social networks on the Hive blockchain**
Hivemind is a "consensus interpretation" layer for the Hive blockchain, maintaining the state of social features such as
post feeds, follows, and communities. Written in Python, it synchronizes an SQL database with chain state, providing
developers with a more flexible/extensible alternative to the raw hived API.

## Environment

- Python 3.8+ required
- Python dependencies: `pip >= 22.2.2` and `setuptools >= 63.1.0`
- Postgres 12+ recommended

### Dependencies

- Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-venv`

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Hivemind is a [HAF](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/haf)-based application. To work properly it requires an existing
and working HAF database.

Hivemind also requires the postgresql `intarray` extension to be installed. The postgresql user who has `CREATE`
privilege can load the module with following command:

```postgresql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS intarray;
```

Clone the hivemind repository with its submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind.git
cd hivemind
```

Update your global Python installation tools, by specifying:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### Install the Hivemind itself

You can install additional dependencies for testing, development etc.
All the dependencies are listed in the `setup.cfg` file under the `[options.extras_require]` section.
You can include them by adding the extra flag to install command like:

```bash
pip install .'[tests]'
````

<details>
<summary>Install in virtual environment manually (RECOMMENDED)</summary>

```bash
cd hivemind                # Go to the hivemind repository
python3 -m venv venv/      # Create virtual environment in the ./venv/ directory
. venv/bin/activate        # Activate it
pip install .              # Install Hivemind
```

Now everytime you want to start the hivemind indexer or API server, you should activate the virtual environment with:

```bash
cd hivemind
. venv/bin/activate
```

To deactivate virtual environment run:

```bash
deactivate
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Install in your operating system scope</summary>

Enter following command in terminal:

```bash
cd hivemind
pip install --no-cache-dir --verbose --user . 2>&1 | tee pip_install.log
```

</details>

### Dockerized setup

#### Building

To build image holding Hivemind instance, please use [build_instance.sh](scripts/ci-helpers/build_instance.sh). This script requires several parameters:

- a tag identifier to be set on the built image
- directory where Hivemind source code is located
- docker registry url to produce fully qualified image name and allow to correctly resolve its dependencies

```bash
# Assuming you are in workdir directory, to perform out of source build
../hivemind/scripts/ci-helpers/build_instance.sh local ../hivemind registry.gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind
```

#### Running HAF instance container

A Hivemind instance requires a HAF instance to process incoming blockchain data collected and to store its own data in fork-resistant manner (allows hivemind data to be reverted in case of a fork).
The easiest way to setup a HAF instance is to use a dockerized instance.

To start a HAF instance, we need to prepare a data directory containing:

- a blockchain subdirectory (where can be put the block_log file used by hived)
- optionally, but very useful, a copy of haf/doc/haf_postgresql_conf.d directory, which allows simple customization of Postgres database setup by modification of `custom_postgres.conf` and `custom_pg_hba.conf` files stored inside.

Please take care to set correct file permissions in order to provide write access to the data directory for processes running inside the HAF container.

```bash
cd /storage1/haf-data-dir/
../hivemind/haf/scripts/run_hived_img.sh registry.gitlab.syncad.com/hive/haf/instance:instance-<tag> --name=haf-mainnet-instance  --data-dir="$(pwd)" <hived-options>
```

For example, for testing purposes (assuming block_log file has been put into data-dir), you can spawn a 5M block replay to prepare a HAF database for further quick testing:

```bash
../hivemind/haf/scripts/run_hived_img.sh registry.gitlab.syncad.com/hive/haf/instance:instance-v1.27.3.0 --name=haf-mainnet-instance  --data-dir="$(pwd)" --replay --stop-replay-at-block=5000000
```

By examining hived.log file or using docker logs haf-mainnet-instance, you can examine state of the started instance. Once replay will be finished, you can continue and start the Hivemind sync process.

Example output of hived process stopped on 5,000,000th block:

```bash

#### Running Hivemind instance container

The built Hivemind instance requires a preconfigured HAF database to store its data. To perform required database configuration, you should start:

```bash
../hivemind/scripts/setup_postgres.sh --postgres-url=postgresql://haf_app_admin@172.17.0.2/haf_block_log
../hivemind/scripts/setup_db.sh --postgres-url=postgresql://haf_admin@172.17.0.2/haf_block_log # warning this command requires haf_admin access since super user permissions are required to install intarray extension
```

Above commands assume that the running HAF container has IP: 172.17.0.2

```bash
../hivemind/scripts/run_instance.sh registry.gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/instance:local sync --database-url="postgresql://haf_app_admin@172.17.0.2:5432/haf_block_log"
```

## Updating from an existing hivemind database

```bash
cd hivemind/hive/db/sql_scripts
./db_upgrade.sh *user-name* hive
```

(where *user-name* is your database login name)

## Running

Export the URL to your HAF database:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://hivemind_app:pass@localhost:5432/haf_block_log
```

### Start the hivemind indexer (aka synchronization process)

```bash
hive sync
```

```bash
$ hive status
{'db_head_block': 19930833, 'db_head_time': '2018-02-16 21:37:36', 'db_head_age': 10}
```

### Start the hivemind API server

```bash
hive server
```

```bash
$ curl --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"hive.db_head_state","params":{}}' http://localhost:8080
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": {"db_head_block": 19930795, "db_head_time": "2018-02-16 21:35:42", "db_head_age": 10}, "id": 0}
```

## Tests

To run api tests:

1. Make sure that the current version of `hivemind` is installed,
2. Api tests require that `hivemind` is synced to a node replayed up to `5_000_024` blocks (including mocks).\
   This means, you should have your HAF database replayed up to `5_000_000` mainnet blocks and run the mocking script with:

    ```bash
    cd hivemind/scripts/ci/
    ./scripts/ci/add-mocks-to-db.sh
    ```

3. Run `hivemind` in `server` mode
4. Set env variables:

    ```bash
    export HIVEMIND_PORT=8080
    export HIVEMIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
    ```

5. Run tests using tox:

    ```bash
    tox -e tavern -- -n auto --durations=0
    ```

```

## Overview

### Purpose

Hivemind is a 2nd layer microservice that reads blocks of operations and virtual operations generated by the Hive
blockchain network (hived nodes), then organizes the data from these operations into a convenient form for querying by
Hive applications.
Hivemind's API is focused on providing social media-related information to Hive apps. This includes information about
posts, comments, votes, reputation, and Hive user profiles.

#### Hivemind tracks posts, relationships, social actions, custom operations, and derived states

- *discussions:* by blog, trending, hot, created, etc
- *communities:* mod roles/actions, members, feeds (in
  1.5; [spec](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/blob/master/docs/communities.md))
- *accounts:* normalized profile data, reputation
- *feeds:* un/follows and un/reblogs

#### Hivemind does not track most blockchain operations

For anything to do with wallets, orders, escrow, keys, recovery, or account history, you should query hived.

#### Hivemind can be extended or leveraged to create

- reactions, bookmarks
- comment on reblogs
- indexing custom profile data
- reorganize old posts (categorize, filter, hide/show)
- voting/polls (democratic or burn/send to vote)
- modlists: (e.g. spammy, abuse, badtaste)
- crowdsourced metadata
- mentions indexing
- full-text search
- follow lists
- bot tracking
- mini-games
- community bots

### Core indexer

Ingests blocks sequentially, processing operations relevant to accounts, post creations/edits/deletes, and custom_json
ops for follows, reblogs, and communities. From these we build account and post lookup tables, follow/reblog state, and
communities/members data. Built exclusively from raw blocks, it becomes the ground truth for internal state. Hive does
not reimplement logic required for deriving payout values, reputation, and other statistics which are much more easily
attained from hived itself in the cache layer.

For efficiency reasons, when first started, hive sync will begin in an "initial sync" mode where it processes in chunks
of 1000 blocks at a time until it gets near the current head block, then it will switch to LIVE SYNC mode, where it
begins processing blocks one at a time, as they are produced by hive nodes. Before it switches to LIVE SYNC mode, hive
sync will create the database indexes necessary for hive server to efficiently process API queries.

### Cache layer

Synchronizes the latest state of posts and users, allowing us to serve discussions and lists of posts with all expected
information (title, preview, image, payout, votes, etc) without needing `hived`. This layer is first built once the
initial core indexing is complete. Incoming blocks trigger cache updates (including recalculation of trending score) for
any posts referenced in `comment` or `vote` operations. There is a sweep to paid out posts to ensure they are updated in
full with their final state.

### API layer

Performs queries against the core and cache tables, merging them into a response in such a way that the frontend will
not need to perform any additional calls to `hived` itself. The initial API simply mimics hived's `condenser_api` for
backwards compatibility, but will be extended to leverage new opportunities and simplify application development.

### Fork Resolution

**Latency vs. consistency vs. complexity**
The easiest way to avoid forks is to only index up to the last irreversible block, but the delay is too much where users
expect quick feedback, e.g. votes and live discussions. We can apply the following approach:

1. Follow the chain as closely to `head_block` as possible
2. Indexer trails a few blocks behind, by no more than 6s - 9s
3. If missed blocks detected, back off from `head_block`
4. Database constraints on block linking to detect failure asap
5. If a fork is encountered between `hive_head` and `steem_head`, trivial recovery
6. Otherwise, pop blocks until in sync. Inconsistent state possible but rare for `TRAIL_BLOCKS > 1`.
7. A separate service with a greater follow distance creates periodic snapshots
